item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies the company s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require it to make estimates and judgments that significantly affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company regularly evaluates these estimates  including those related to inventory valuation and revenue recognition 
these estimates are based on historical experience and on assumptions that are believed by management to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates  which may impact the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of consolidated financial statements 
inventory valuation the company values inventories at the lower of cost or market 
the company records charges to write down inventories for unsalable  excess or obsolete raw materials  work in process and finished goods 
newly introduced parts are generally not valued until success in the market place has been determined by a consistent pattern of sales and backlog among other factors 
in addition to writedowns based on newly introduced parts  statistical and judgmental assessments are calculated for the remaining inventory based on salability and obsolescence 
revenue recognition revenue from product sales made directly to customers is recognized upon the transfer of title  which generally occurs at the time of shipment 
revenue from the company s sales to domestic distributors is recognized under agreements which provide for certain sales price rebates and limited product return privileges 
as a result  the company defers recognition of such sales until the domestic distributors sell the merchandise 
the company relieves inventory and records a receivable on the initial sale to the distributor as title has passed to the distributor and payment is collected on the receivable within normal trade terms 
the income to be derived from distributor sales is recorded under current liabilities on the balance sheet as deferred income on shipments to distributors until such time as the distributor confirms a final sale to its end customer 
the company s sales to international distributors are made under agreements which permit limited stock return privileges but not sales price rebates 
revenue on these sales is recognized upon shipment at which time title passes 
the company estimates international distributor returns based on historical data and current business expectations and defers a portion of international distributor sales and profits based on these estimated returns 
such amounts are classified in deferred income on shipments to distributors on the accompanying balance sheet

consequently  should these positive trends continue  the company expects to have a seasonally strong start to the new fiscal year with sales growing roughly sequentially in the september fiscal quarter from the june quarter just completed
