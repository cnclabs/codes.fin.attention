item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis presents factors  which we believe are relevant to an assessment and understanding of our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
this financial and business analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in item also see item for related financial information 
overview dobson communications 
we are one of the largest providers of rural and suburban wireless communications systems in the united states 
we began providing wireless telephone services in in oklahoma and the texas panhandle 
we have rapidly expanded our wireless operations with an acquisition strategy targeting underdeveloped rural and suburban areas  which we believe have a significant number of potential customers with substantial needs for wireless communications 
on august   american cellular corporation became our wholly owned subsidiary 
at december   american cellular s systems covered a total population of million and had approximately  subscribers  giving american cellular an aggregate market penetration of 
at december   our wireless systems covered a population of million and we had approximately  subscribers  with an aggregate market penetration of 
concurrently with the august  acquisition and restructuring of american cellular described below  we merged our indirect  wholly owned subsidiaries  dobson sygnet communications company  sygnet wireless  inc  and sygnet communications  inc with and into our wholly owned subsidiary  dcs 
as a result of these mergers  and the acquisition and restructuring of american cellular  our operations are encompassed in our two primary subsidiaries  dcs and american cellular 
american cellular does not guarantee any debt or other obligations of dcs or us  and dcs and we do not guarantee any debt or other obligations of american cellular 
as part of the american cellular acquisition and restructuring  we agreed to appoint to our board of directors two persons who were recommended by the former holders of american cellular s senior subordinated notes  and who were acceptable to us and our principal shareholder  dobson cc limited partnership 
we also agreed to limit the size of our board of directors to seven persons 
accordingly  on february   messrs 
mark s 
feighner and robert a 
schriesheim became members of our board  and russell l 
dobson  one of our founders and a long time director  withdrew as a director 
mr 
feighner is an experienced  strategic  customer focused wireless services executive 
mr 
schriesheim is a highly qualified finance executive with significant experience in maximizing shareholder value through operational and financial improvements 
american cellular 
until august   we owned a interest in a joint venture that owned american cellular 
we accounted for our interest using the equity method of accounting 
as a result  through august   we reflected our equity share of the american cellular joint venture in a single line item entitled investment in joint venture in our balance sheet and our share of the american cellular joint venture s net income or loss in a single line item entitled loss from investment in joint venture in our statement of operations 
at june  and continuing through august  american cellular was not in compliance with its total debt leverage ratio covenant contained in its credit facility 
due to this and other factors and circumstances in existence in  american cellular re evaluated the carrying value of its goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets in accordance with statements of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
these re evaluations resulted in american cellular s recognition of impairment losses totaling million at june  and million at december  after recognizing our portion of the impairment at june   our investment in the american cellular joint venture was written down to zero 
therefore  the december  impairment loss of million did not impact our results of operations or financial condition 

table of contents on august   we completed the restructuring of american cellular s indebtedness and equity ownership 
pursuant to this restructuring  we completed an exchange offer for american cellular s then outstanding senior subordinated notes due the existing notes 
holders of million of the existing notes exchanged their notes for million shares of our class a common stock   shares of our series f convertible preferred stock with an aggregate liquidation preference of million  convertible into a maximum of million shares of our class a common stock  and million in cash 
we also issued  shares of our series f convertible preferred stock and  shares of our class a common stock in payment of certain fees 
upon consummation of the restructuring  american cellular became our wholly owned subsidiary 
subsequently  all significant subsidiaries of american cellular were merged into american cellular 
on august   acc escrow corp  our newly formed  wholly owned  indirect subsidiary  completed an offering of million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due the senior notes were issued at par and were assumed by american cellular when acc escrow corp 
merged into american cellular as part of the restructuring 
the net proceeds from the offering were used to fully repay american cellular s existing bank credit facility and to pay expenses of the restructuring 
american cellular has filed with the securities and exchange commission an annual report on form k for the year ended december  while we provide you with much of american cellular s financial and operational information for  we refer you to american cellular s annual report to ensure you have a complete understanding of american cellular s financial and operational results

american cellular and we used the proceeds from the sale of these properties primarily to pay down bank debt under our respective credit facilities 

table of contents trends and guidance on february   we held an investor s conference regarding our fourth quarter results of operations  certain trends in our roaming operations and business plans and guidance for we believe that the information provided during the investor s conference is important to an understanding of us  trends in our business and our future operating expectations 
while we summarize below much of the information provided at the conference  we refer you to our form k filed with the commission on february   as well as to our website to obtain a copy of the presentation used in the conference  as well as to listen to the rebroadcast of the conference 
subscribers our subscriber base contains three types of subscribers  post paid  reseller and pre paid 
at december   post paid subscribers accounted for of our subscriber base 
these subscribers pay a monthly access fee for a wireless service plan that generally includes a fixed amount of minutes and certain service features 
in addition to the monthly access fee  these subscribers are typically billed in arrears for long distance charges  roaming charges and rate plan overages 
our reseller subscribers are similar to our post paid subscribers in that they pay monthly fees to utilize our network and services 
however  these subscribers are billed by a third party reseller  who has effectively resold our service to the end user subscriber 
we in turn bill the third party reseller for the monthly usage of the end user subscriber 
at december   the reseller base accounted for of our total subscriber base 
our pre paid subscribers  which at december  accounted for of our subscriber base  are subscribers that pre pay for an agreed upon amount of usage 
our average monthly revenue per subscriber  discussed below under revenue  and our total gross additions are calculated and reported based only on post paid subscriber information 
we have experienced a decline in our post paid gross additions as a result of increased competition attributable to an accelerating pace of improvements in quality of digital technology  and increased products offered to the consumer 
many of our competitors already provide market enhanced data services  such as xrtt 
currently  we are in the process of upgrading our network to gsm gprs edge and expect our gross subscriber additions to increase during  as a result of new services that will be available with gsm gprs edge 
post paid gross subscriber additions from our continuing operations were  for the year ended december  this included  from our recent acquisitions  from the date of their respective acquisition 
post paid gross subscriber additions were  for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december  revenue our operating revenue consists of service revenue  roaming revenue and equipment and other revenue 
we derive service revenue by providing wireless services to our subscribers 
the wireless industry has experienced declining average revenue per minute as competition among wireless service providers has led to reductions in rates for airtime 
these declines have generally been offset by significant increases in average minutes of use per subscriber 
as a result  our average monthly revenue per post paid subscriber has remained constant  amounting to for the year ended december   excluding the impact of our acquisitions  for the year ended december   and for the year ended december  we believe there is an opportunity in for our average monthly revenue per post paid subscriber to increase from current levels primarily due to additional voice and data services available as a result of our providing gsm gprs edge technology 
we derive roaming revenue by providing service to subscribers of other wireless providers when those subscribers roam into our markets and use our systems to carry their calls 
roaming revenues have traditionally had higher margins than revenues from our subscribers 
we achieve these higher margins because we incur relatively lower incremental costs related to network operations  billing  customer service and collections in servicing roaming customers as compared to our home subscribers 
however  our roaming margins are declining and are becoming more comparable to margins from our subscribers due to increased 
table of contents market pressures and competition among wireless providers resulting in reduced rates in our new roaming contracts and scheduled rate reductions in our existing roaming contracts 
our roaming yield roaming service revenue  which includes airtime  toll charges and surcharges  divided by roaming minutes of use was for the year ended december   for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  on a combined basis  dcs and american cellular  had a roaming yield of for the year ended december  we expect our roaming yield to decline by approximately during even though these roaming contracts provide for decreasing rates over time  we believe these roaming contracts are beneficial because they secure existing traffic and provide opportunity for a continuing increase in traffic volumes 
roaming revenue tends to be impacted by seasonality 
historically  we have experienced higher roaming minutes of use and related roaming revenue during the second and third quarters of each year  as users tend to travel more and  therefore  use their wireless phones more  during the spring and summer months 
we include long distance revenue in service revenue and roaming revenue 
equipment revenue is revenue from selling wireless equipment to our subscribers 
equipment revenue is recognized when the equipment is delivered to the customer 
costs and expenses our primary operating expense categories include cost of service  cost of equipment  marketing and selling costs  general and administrative costs and depreciation and amortization 
our cost of service consists primarily of costs to operate and maintain our facilities utilized in providing service to customers and amounts paid to third party wireless providers for providing service to our subscribers when our subscribers roam into their markets  referred to as roaming costs 
consistent with the trend of declining roaming revenue per minute  our roaming expense per minute has declined as well 
as a result  our cash cost per user has continued to decline 
our cash cost per user was for the year ended december   for the year ended december   and for the year ended december  this decline in expense per minute has contributed significantly to the recent trend of declining cost of service 
our cost of equipment represents the costs associated with wireless equipment and accessories sold to customers 
in recent years  we and other wireless providers have continued the use of discounts on phone equipment and free phone promotions  as competition between service providers has intensified 
as a result  we have incurred  and expect to continue to incur  losses on equipment sales 
while we expect to continue these discounts and promotions  we believe that these promotions will result in increased revenue from increases in the number of wireless subscribers 
our marketing and selling costs include advertising  compensation paid to sales personnel and independent agents and all other costs to market and sell wireless products and services 
we pay commissions to sales personnel and independent dealers for new business generated 
our general and administrative costs include all infrastructure costs  including costs for customer support  billing  collections  and corporate administration 
our depreciation and amortization expense represents the costs associated with the depreciation of our fixed assets and the amortization of certain intangible assets 
critical accounting policies and practices it is necessary that we use estimates in the presentation of our financial statements with respect to the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our use of estimates and assumptions affects the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  and the amount of revenues and expenses we recognize for and during the reporting period 
our general and administrative expenses and certain other operating expenses include all infrastructure costs  including costs for customer support  billing  collections and corporate administration 
we share our 
table of contents corporate and shared call center costs with our subsidiaries  which are costs allocated primarily based on the estimated subscribers and populations in their respective licensed areas 
we depreciate our property  plant and equipment and amortize our customer lists and certain other intangible assets over their useful lives 
these useful lives are based on our estimates of the period that the assets will generate revenue 
with the implementation of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which requires companies to cease the amortization of existing goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives  we reassessed the useful lives of our intangible assets 
a significant portion of our intangible assets is classified as wireless license acquisition costs  which represents our costs associated with acquiring our fcc licenses 
these licenses allow us to provide wireless services by giving us the exclusive right to utilize certain radio frequency spectrum 
although the fcc licenses are issued for only a fixed time  generally ten years  these licenses are renewed by the fcc on a routine basis and for a nominal fee 
in addition  we have determined that there are no legal  regulatory  contractual  competitive  economic or other factors that limit the useful life of these fcc licenses 
as a result  our wireless license acquisition costs are treated as indefinite life intangible assets 
therefore  upon implementing sfas no 
in its entirety  we ceased the amortization of both goodwill and wireless license acquisition costs and now test for impairment of goodwill and wireless license acquisition costs at least annually and only adjust the carrying amount of these intangible assets upon an impairment of the goodwill and wireless license acquisition costs 
we also determine on an annual basis whether facts and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life 
this change in policy has and may continue to have a significant impact on our results of operations and financial position 
for the year ended december   the aggregate amount of amortization expense  net of income tax benefit  attributable to our wireless license acquisition costs was million 
without this amortization and before considering the impact of this change on american cellular  our operating results would have been in thousands except per share data net loss net loss applicable to common stockholders net loss applicable to common stockholders per common share in addition  for the year ended december   american cellular  recorded million of amortization expense related to its goodwill and million of amortization expense  net of income tax benefit  related to its wireless license acquisition costs 
without this amortization  american cellular s operating results would have been in thousands except per share data net loss net loss applicable to common stockholder net loss applicable to common stockholder per common share as stated above  through december   our accounting policy for impairment of long lived assets was to review the carrying value of our long lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
if such circumstances were deemed to exist  the carrying value of the asset would be compared to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows generated by the asset 
our definite life assets will continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives and are subject to the same impairment criteria 
as a result of fully implementing sfas no 
on january   we are required to evaluate the carrying value of our indefinite life intangible assets at least annually  using their fair values 
to complete this evaluation  we compare the carrying amount of our wireless license acquisition costs to the fair value of those assets 
for purposes of this comparison  it is our policy to aggregate our wireless license acquisition costs 
we determine the fair value of our wireless license acquisition costs based on their estimated future discounted cash flows 

table of contents based on the comparison we performed upon implementation  we concluded that the carrying amount of our wireless license acquisition costs exceeded their estimated fair value 
therefore  upon implementation of this new pronouncement in its entirety  we recorded a charge  net of income tax benefit  of million to reflect the write down of our wireless license acquisition costs to their fair value and a charge of million to reflect our previously owned share in the write down to their fair value of the wireless license acquisition costs of american cellular 
we believe it is necessary for an understanding of our significant accounting policies to read the above in conjunction with note  significant accounting policies  to our financial statements included in item of this form k 
these other significant accounting policies  while not involving the same level of measurement uncertainties as those discussed above  are nevertheless important to an understanding of our financial statements 
policies related to revenue recognition  financial instruments and business combinations require judgments on complex matters that are often subject to multiple sources of authoritative guidance 
certain of these matters are among topics currently under re examination by accounting standard setters and regulatory authorities 
although no specific conclusions reached by these standard setters or regulatory authorities appear likely to cause a material change in our accounting policies  we cannot predict the outcomes with certainty 
results of operations the financial statement numbers have been rounded  however  the percentage changes are based on the actual financial statement numbers 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  operating revenue 
for the year ended december   our total operating revenue increased million  or  to million from million for the comparable period in the following table sets forth the components of our operating revenue for the periods indicated year ended december  amount percentage amount percentage in thousands service revenue roaming revenue equipment and other revenue total for the year ended december   our service revenue increased million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to our acquisition of american cellular on august   and the two alaska properties we acquired on june   the acquisitions 
the acquisitions during accounted for million of our service revenue for the year ended december  before giving effect to these acquisitions  our service revenue increased million 
this increase was primarily attributable to our increased subscriber base in our non acquisition markets 
our average subscriber base in our non acquisition markets increased  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  for the year ended december   our roaming revenue increased million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  the acquisitions during accounted for million of our roaming revenue for the year ended december  before giving effect to these acquisitions  our roaming revenue decreased million 
this is primarily a result of a decline in our roaming revenue per minute of use in our non acquisition markets as contractual rates decreased during this decline in our roaming revenue per minute of use in our non acquisition markets was partially offset by a increase in roaming minutes in our non acquisition markets due to expanded coverage areas and increased usage 

table of contents for the year ended december   our equipment and other revenue increased million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  the acquisitions during accounted for million of our equipment and other revenue for the year ended december  before giving effect to these acquisitions  our equipment and other revenue increased million 
this is primarily due to increases in amounts previously charged to our unconsolidated affiliates for the use of shared assets 
cost of service 
for the year ended december   our total cost of service increased million  or  to million from million for the comparable period in the acquisitions during accounted for million of our cost of service for the year ended december  before giving effect to these acquisitions  our cost of service decreased million 
the following table sets forth the components of our cost of service for the periods indicated year ended december  amount percentage amount percentage in thousands network costs roaming costs total cost of service for the year ended december   our network costs  which are the costs incurred from operating our wireless network and providing service to our customers  increased by million  or to million from million for the comparable period in the acquisitions during accounted for million of our network costs for the year ended december  before giving effect to these acquisitions  network costs declined million 
this is primarily a result of credits received from certain of our network service providers and renegotiated lower local access rates charged to us by third party providers for use of local access across the network 
for the year ended december   roaming costs increased by million  or  to million from million for the comparable period in the acquisitions during accounted for million of our roaming costs for the year ended december  before giving effect to these acquisitions  roaming costs declined million 
this is primarily a result of a decline in rates charged by those providers resulting from new lower rate agreements  offset by an increase in the minutes used by our customers on third party wireless providers networks  in our non acquisition markets 
cost of equipment 
for the year ended december   our cost of equipment increased million  or  to million during from million in the acquisitions during accounted for million of our cost of equipment for the year ended december  before giving effect to these acquisitions  our cost of equipment decreased million 
this is primarily a result of a decrease in gross subscriber additions in our non acquisition markets 
marketing and selling costs 
for the year ended december   our marketing and selling costs increased million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  the acquisitions during accounted for million of our marketing and selling costs for the year ended december  before giving effect to these acquisitions  our marketing and selling costs decreased million

for the year ended december   our general and administrative costs increased million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  the acquisitions during accounted for million of our general and administrative costs for the year ended december  before giving effect to these acquisitions  our general and administrative costs increased million 
this increase is a result of increased infrastructure costs such as customer service  billing  and administrative costs as a result of the overall growth of our business  offset by the 
table of contents reductions in bad debt expense as a result of improved collections and efficiencies gained from further integration of acquired companies and increased economies of scale in our non acquisition markets 
overall  our average monthly general and administrative costs per average subscriber decreased to approximately for compared to approximately for in our non acquisition markets 
depreciation and amortization expense 
for the year ended december   our depreciation and amortization expense increased million  or  to million from million for the acquisitions during accounted for million of our depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended december  before giving effect to these acquisitions  our depreciation and amortization expense increased million 
this increase in our non acquisition markets is a result of additional depreciation on fixed assets acquired in and interest expense 
for the year ended december   our interest expense increased million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  the acquisitions during accounted for million of our interest expense for the year ended december  before giving effect to these acquisitions  our interest expense decreased million 
this is primarily the result of the repayment of our outstanding balance on our dobson operating co 
llc and sygnet wireless credit facilities and decreased variable interest rates as a result of lower interest rates and the expiration of our interest rate hedges  offset by the interest expense on our new dcs credit facility 
loss gain from extinguishment of debt 
for the year ended december   our loss from extinguishment of debt was million  compared to a gain of million for the year ended december  the loss from extinguishment of debt for the year ended december   was due to paying off the doc llc credit facility  the sygnet credit facility and million principal amount of the dobson sygnet senior notes 
our gain from extinguishment of debt for the year ended december   resulted from the repurchase of million principal amount of dobson sygnet senior notes for the purchase price of million 
redemptions and repurchases of  and dividends on  preferred stock 
for the year ended december   our redemptions and repurchases of and dividends on preferred stock are represented as both a financing expense  included in our net loss  and as an item below our net loss  reflected only in our net loss applicable to common shareholders 
this change in presentation is the result of implementing sfas no 
during  which requires dividends on mandatorily redeemable preferred stock and any gains or losses on redemption and repurchases of mandatorily redeemable preferred stock to be reflected as a financing expense included in net income loss for periods beginning after june  thus  our income statement includes the following year ended december  in thousands financing expense above net loss loss from redemption and repurchases of preferred stock dividends on mandatorily redeemable preferred stock items applicable to common shareholders below net loss dividends on preferred stock gain on redemption and repurchased of preferred stock although our dividends on preferred stock are in two separate lines items for the year ended december   they totaled million  on a combined basis  which compares to million for the year ended december  this decrease in dividends of million is the result of the reduction in the number of shares of our preferred stock outstanding due to redemptions and repurchases of our preferred stock during and during the year ended december   prior to the adoption of sfas no 
 we repurchased a total of million liquidation preference amount of our senior exchangeable preferred stock and million liquidation preference amount of our senior exchangeable preferred stock  for an aggregate 
table of contents purchase price of million 
including deferred financing costs  this resulted in a gain on repurchase of preferred stock totaling million 
in addition  at t wireless transferred to us all of our series aa preferred stock  which had a fair value that was substantially lower than our carrying value  thus resulting in a gain on redemption of million 
therefore  our total gain on redemptions and repurchases of preferred stock prior to adoption of sfas no 
or july   was million 
subsequent to the adoption of sfas no 
 in  we repurchased a total of million liquidation preference amount of our senior exchangeable preferred stock  for an aggregate purchase price of million  which  including fees and the related write off of deferred financing costs  resulted in a loss from redemptions and repurchases of preferred stock of million 
although our redemptions and repurchases of preferred stock are in two separate lines items for the year ended december   they netted to a gain of million on a combined basis 
during  we repurchased shares of our senior exchangeable preferred stock having a carrying value of million and shares of our senior exchangeable preferred stock having a carrying value of million  including accrued dividends on the repurchased shares  for an aggregate purchase price of million 
including deferred financing costs  this resulted in a gain on redemptions and repurchases of preferred stock totaling million for the year ended december  other income expense  net 
for the year ended december   our other income expense increased by million  or  to income of million from an expense of million for the year ended december   due to an increase in interest income during and the write off of costs associated with the eleven licenses we did not receive in the fcc auction  which were written off during loss from investment in joint venture 
for the year ended december   we incurred a loss  net of income tax benefit  before discontinued operations and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  from our previously owned joint venture totaling million 
this loss represents our previous proportionate loss in american cellular  limited to our previous investment in american cellular 
discontinued operations 
for the year ended december   we had income from discontinued operations including the gain on the sale of million compared to million in discontinued operations during relate to both the california alaska swap with at t wireless and the michigan maryland swap with cingular wireless  while discontinued operations in relate to the california alaska swap with at t wireless  the michigan maryland swap with cingular wireless and the markets sold to verizon wireless 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
for the year ended december   we recognized a total impairment on our wireless license acquisition costs of approximately million  net of tax benefit  as a result of implementing sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
of this total  million reflects our impairment and million reflects the impairment from our then interest in american cellular 
net loss 
for the year ended december   our net loss was million 
our net loss decreased million  from a net loss of million for the year ended december  the decrease in our net loss was primarily attributable to our loss recognized in from the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle and on our loss from our previous investment in joint venture  offset by the gain from the sale of discontinued operations 

table of contents year ended december  compared to year ended december  operating revenue

our average subscriber base increased to  at december  from  at december  even though we have experienced increased competition and market pressure  our average monthly service revenue per subscriber remained constant  because our average monthly service revenue per subscriber continues to be positively impacted by changes in the mix of digital and analog subscribers in our subscriber base 
our digital subscribers tend to use more minutes in a larger home area than our analog subscribers 
for the year ended december   our roaming revenue decreased million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  this decline in revenue was attributable to a decline in our roaming revenue per minute of use  partially offset by a increase in roaming minutes in our markets 
for the year ended december   our equipment and other revenue decreased million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  this decline in revenue is primarily due to our slight decline in gross subscriber additions and the slow down in the migration of existing subscribers from analog to digital service
