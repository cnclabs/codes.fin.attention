item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a description of a number of factors that could adversely affect our results 
business segments we manage our business with two segments commercial and government 
the commercial segment consists of members enrolled in products marketed to employer groups and individuals  and includes three lines 
table of contents of business fully insured medical  administrative services only  or aso  and specialty 
the government segment consists of members enrolled in government sponsored programs  and includes three lines of business medicare choice  medicaid  and tricare 
we identified our segments in accordance with the aggregation provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information which is consistent with information used by our chief executive officer in managing our business 
the segment information aggregates products with similar economic characteristics 
these characteristics include the nature of customer groups  pricing  benefits  and underwriting requirements 
the results of each segment are measured by income before income taxes 
we allocate all selling  general and administrative expenses  investment and other income  interest expense  and goodwill  but no other assets or liabilities  to our segments 
members served by our two segments generally utilize the same medical provider networks  enabling us to obtain more favorable contract terms with providers 
our segments also share overhead costs and assets 
as a result  the profitability of each segment is interdependent 
strategy our business strategy centers on increasing commercial segment profitability while building on our existing strength in the government segment and exploring opportunities under the recently enacted medicare prescription drug  improvement  and modernization act  or dima 
our strategy to increase commercial segment profitability focuses on providing solutions for employers to the rising cost of health care through the use of innovative and consumer choice product designs which are supported by service excellence and industry leading electronic capabilities  including education  tools  and technologies provided primarily through the internet 
the intent of our commercial segment strategy is to enable us to further penetrate high potential commercial markets and to transform the traditional experience for both employers and members in order to achieve a high degree of consumer satisfaction and loyalty

table of contents our products marketed to commercial segment employers and members new generation of products we have developed a range of innovative products  styled as smart products  that we believe will be a solution for employers who annually are facing double digit premium increases driven by medical cost inflation 
our new generation of products provide more  choices for the individual consumer   transparency of provider costs  and  benefit designs that engage consumers in the costs and effectiveness of health care choices 
innovative tools and technology are available to assist consumers with these decisions  including the trade offs between higher premiums and point of service costs at the time consumers choose their plans  and to suggest ways in which the consumers can maximize their individual benefits at the point they use their plans 
these products are sold to employers with humana as the sole carrier  but are available on either a fully insured or self funded basis 
as of december   we had enrolled approximately  members into our smart products 
many of our smart products  as well as our more traditional products  are offered to employer groups as bundles  where the subscribers are offered various hmo and ppo options  with various employer contribution strategies as determined by the customer 
hmo our health maintenance organization  or hmo  products provide prepaid health insurance coverage to our members through a network of independent primary care physicians  specialty physicians  and other health care providers who contract with the hmo to furnish such services 
primary care physicians generally include internists  family practitioners  and pediatricians 
generally  the member s primary care physician must approve access to certain specialty physicians and other health care providers 
these other health care providers include  among others  hospitals  nursing homes  home health agencies  pharmacies  mental health and substance abuse centers  diagnostic centers  optometrists  outpatient surgery centers  dentists  urgent care centers  and durable medical equipment suppliers 
because the primary care physician generally must approve access to many of these other health care providers  the hmo product is considered the most restrictive form of managed care 
an hmo member  typically through the member s employer  pays a monthly fee  which generally covers  with some copayments  health care services received from or approved by the member s primary care physician 
for the year ended december   commercial hmo premium revenues totaled approximately billion  or of our total premiums and aso fees 
ppo our preferred provider organization  or ppo  products  which are marketed primarily to commercial groups and individuals  include some elements of managed health care 
however  they typically include more cost sharing with the member  through copayments and annual deductibles 
ppos also are similar to traditional health insurance because they provide a member with more freedom to choose a physician or other health care provider 
in a ppo  the member is encouraged  through financial incentives  to use participating health care providers  which have contracted with the ppo to provide services at favorable rates 
in the event a member chooses not to use a participating health care provider  the member may be required to pay a greater portion of the provider s fees 
in june  we introduced humanaone  a major medical product marketed directly to individuals 
we introduced this product in select markets where we can utilize our existing networks and distribution channels 
for the year ended december   commercial and individual ppo premium revenues totaled approximately billion  or of our total premiums and aso fees 

table of contents administrative services only we offer an administrative services only  or aso  product to those who self insure their employee health plans 
we receive fees to provide administrative services which generally include the processing of claims  offering access to our provider networks and clinical programs  and responding to customer service inquiries from members of self funded employers 
these products may include all of the same benefit and product design characteristics of our fully insured ppo and hmo products described above  however  under aso contracts  self funded employers retain the risk of financing the cost of health benefits 
for the year ended december   commercial aso fees totaled million  or of our total premiums and aso fees 
specialty products we also offer various specialty products including dental  group life  and short term disability 
at december   we had approximately million specialty members 
for the year ended december   specialty product premium revenues were approximately million  or of our total premiums and aso fees 
our products marketed to government segment members and beneficiaries medicare choice product medicare is a federal program that provides persons age and over and some disabled persons certain hospital and medical insurance benefits  which include hospitalization benefits for up to days per incident of illness plus a lifetime reserve aggregating days 
each medicare eligible individual is entitled to receive inpatient hospital care  known as part a care  without the payment of any premium  but is required to pay a premium to the federal government  which is adjusted annually  to be eligible for physician care and other services  known as part b care 
we contract with cms under the medicare choice program to provide health insurance coverage in exchange for a fixed monthly payment per member for medicare eligible individuals residing in the geographic areas in which our hmos operate 
individuals who elect to participate in medicare choice programs receive additional benefits not covered by medicare and are relieved of the obligation to pay some or all of the deductible or coinsurance amounts but are generally required to use exclusively the services provided by the hmo subject to nominal copayments and coinsurance and are required to pay a part b premium to the medicare program 
the medicare choice product involves a contract between an hmo and cms  pursuant to which cms makes a fixed monthly payment to the hmo on behalf of each medicare eligible individual that chooses to enroll for coverage in the hmo 
the fixed monthly payment  payable on the first day of a month  is determined by formula established by federal law 
we sometimes receive the fixed monthly payment early due to a weekend or holiday falling on the first day of a month 
since this amount is significant  the timing of its receipt can cause a material fluctuation in our operating cash flows from period to period 
we also collect additional member premiums from our members in most of our markets 
at december   we provided health insurance coverage under cms contracts to approximately  medicare choice members for which we received premium revenues of approximately billion  or of our total premiums and aso fees for one such cms contract covered approximately  members in florida and accounted for premium revenues of approximately billion  which represented of our medicare choice premium revenues  or of our total premiums and aso fees for our medicare choice contracts with the federal government are renewed for a one year term each december unless terminated days prior thereto 
annual increases in per member premiums from cms have ranged from as low as approximately to as high as approximately  with an average of 
table of contents approximately for the five year period beginning january  over the last several years  our medicare choice membership has declined as we exited some counties 
these exits were a result  in part  of lower cms reimbursement rates 
in december  the medicare prescription drug  improvement  and modernization act of  or dima was signed into law 
the legislation establishes a new medicare private health plan program  called medicareadvantage  continuing the health plan options afforded under the former medicare choice program while adding additional health plan options  including regional ppo options beginning in dima includes provisions that require the stabilization funding to be directed toward increased reimbursement for providers  increased benefits or access for members  or decreased member premiums 
including dima funding and changes in member premiums  we expect an to increase in total per member premiums in with a corresponding increase in medical costs due to increased reimbursements for providers and increased benefits for members 
medicaid product medicaid is a federal program that is state operated to facilitate the delivery of health care services to low income residents 
each electing state develops  through a state specific regulatory agency  a medicaid managed care initiative that must be approved by cms 
cms requires that medicaid managed care plans meet federal standards and cost no more than the amount that would have been spent on a comparable fee for service basis 
states currently either use a formal proposal process in which they review many bidders before selecting one or award individual contracts to qualified bidders who apply for entry to the program 
in either case  the contractual relationship with a state generally is for a one year period 
under these contracts  we receive a fixed monthly payment from a government agency for which we are required to provide health insurance coverage to enrolled members 
due to the increased emphasis on state health care reform and budgetary constraints  more states are utilizing a managed care product in their medicaid programs 
we currently have medicaid contracts with the puerto rico health insurance administration through june   subject to each party agreeing upon annual rates 
in july  we signed amendments to the puerto rico medicaid contracts regarding a premium rate increase for the annual period ending june  our other medicaid contracts are in florida and illinois  and are annual contracts 
for the year ended december   premium revenues from our medicaid products totaled million  or of our total premiums and aso fees 
at december   we had approximately  medicaid members in puerto rico  or of total medicaid members  and  medicaid members in florida and illinois  or of total medicaid members 
tricare tricare provides health insurance coverage to the dependents of active duty military personnel and to retired military personnel and their dependents 
in november  the united states department of defense awarded us our first tricare contract for regions and covering approximately million eligible beneficiaries in florida  georgia  south carolina  mississippi  alabama  tennessee and eastern louisiana 
on july   we began providing health insurance coverage to these approximately million eligible beneficiaries 
on may   we purchased the entity responsible for administering tricare benefits for regions and to approximately million eligible beneficiaries in illinois  indiana  kentucky  michigan  north carolina  ohio  tennessee  virginia  wisconsin  west virginia and a portion of missouri 
our current tricare contract with the department of defense will be in effect until april  for regions and and until june  for regions and each of the contracts is subject to a one year renewal at the government s option 
we believe these contracts will continue until the tricare transition described below 

table of contents on august   the department of defense notified us that we were awarded the contract for the south region  one of three newly created regions under the government s revised tricare program 
the current tricare regions and will become part of the new south region along with region  which is currently administered by another contractor 
the current regions and will become part of the north region  which was awarded to another contractor 
pursuant to the department of defense s bid process  each of the three awards was subject to protests by unsuccessful bidders of prime contracts  however  none of the protests were successful 
under the department of defense s current schedule for implementation of the new tricare contracts  regions and will transition to the new north region for the start of healthcare delivery on july  regions and will become part of the new south region for the start of healthcare delivery on august  and region will become part of our new south region for the start of healthcare delivery on november  if this schedule is realized  our tricare membership is expected to temporarily decline to million in july  and is expected to increase to million in november this will also result in a decline in revenues during this period 
in addition  retail pharmacy benefits for tricare beneficiaries will be administered separately under the new department of defense tricare retail pharmacy program 
on september   we were notified that we were not awarded the retail pharmacy contract and  later  that our protest of this award decision was not upheld 
currently  three health benefit options are available to tricare beneficiaries 
in addition to a traditional indemnity option  participants may enroll in an hmo like plan with a point of service option or take advantage of reduced copayments by using a network of preferred providers 
we have subcontracted with third parties to provide various administration and specialty services under the contracts 
for the year ended december   tricare premium revenues were approximately billion  or of our total premiums and aso fees 
at december   we had  tricare aso beneficiaries for which the department of defense retains the risk of financing the cost of their health benefits 
we obtained these beneficiaries from our acquisition of regions and  and by enrollment in two government programs that allow senior beneficiaries to continue in the tricare program even after becoming medicare eligible  which normally is age the first of these programs  called tricare senior pharmacy  became effective april  under this government administrative services program  senior tricare beneficiaries receive certain pharmacy benefits not covered under medicare 
on october   the tricare for life program expanded coverage to include medical benefits as well 
for the year ended december   tricare administrative services fees totaled million  or of our total premiums and aso fees 
once the department of defense s new contracting structure is implemented  our responsibility for both of these programs will cease 
the tricare senior pharmacy program is intended to become part of the previously mentioned tricare retail pharmacy program 
the tricare for life program will become the tricare dual eligible fiscal intermediary contract tdefic 
the tdefic contract  for which we did not bid  was awarded to another contractor on july  it will become effective when the current regional contracts expire 
we do not believe that these tricare contract changes occurring during will have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows

we have approximately  contracts with health care providers participating in our networks  which consist of approximately  physicians   hospitals  and  ancillary providers and dentists 
these ancillary services and facilities include ambulance services  medical equipment services  home health agencies  mental health providers  rehabilitation facilities  nursing homes  optical services  and pharmacies 
our membership base and the ability to influence where our members seek care generally enable us to obtain contractual discounts with providers 
we use a variety of techniques to provide access to effective and efficient use of health care services for our members 
these techniques include the coordination of care for our members  product and benefit designs  hospital inpatient management systems  or hims  and enrolling members into various disease management programs 
the focal point for health care services in many of our medicare choice and hmo networks is the primary care physician who  under contract  provides services  and may control utilization of appropriate services  by directing or approving hospitalization and referrals to specialists and other providers 
some physicians may have arrangements under which they can earn bonuses when certain target goals relating to the provisions of quality patient care are met 
our hims programs use specially trained physicians to effectively manage the entire range of an hmo member s medical care during a hospital admission and to effectively coordinate the member s discharge and post discharge care 
we have available a variety of disease management programs related to specific medical conditions such as congestive heart failure  coronary artery disease  prenatal 
table of contents and premature infant care  asthma related illness  end stage renal disease  diabetes  and breast cancer screening 
we also may focus on certain rare conditions where disease management techniques benefit members in a more cost effective manner 
we typically contract with hospitals on either a per diem rate  which is an all inclusive rate per day  a case rate  which is an all inclusive rate per admission  or at a discounted charge for inpatient hospital services 
outpatient hospital services generally are contracted at a flat rate by type of service or at a discounted charge 
these contracts are often multi year agreements  with rates that are adjusted for inflation annually based on the consumer price index or other nationally recognized inflation index 
outpatient surgery centers and other ancillary providers typically are contracted at flat rates per service provided or are reimbursed based upon a nationally recognized fee schedule such as the medicare allowable fee schedule 
our contracts with physicians typically are automatically renewed each year  unless either party gives written notice to the other party of their intent to terminate the arrangement 
most of the physicians in our ppo networks and some of our physicians in our hmo networks are reimbursed based upon a fixed fee schedule  which typically provides for reimbursement based upon a percentage of the standard medicare allowable fee schedule 
capitation for of our december  medical membership  we contract with hospitals and physicians to accept financial risk for a defined set of hmo membership 
in transferring this risk  we prepay these providers a monthly fixed fee per member  known as a capitation payment  to coordinate substantially all of the medical care for their capitated hmo membership  including some health benefit administrative functions and claims processing 
for these capitated hmo arrangements  we generally agree to reimbursement rates that target a medical expense ratio ranging from to 
providers participating in hospital based capitated hmo arrangements generally receive a monthly payment for all of the services within their system for their hmo membership 
providers participating in physician based capitated hmo arrangements generally have subcontracted directly with hospitals and specialist physicians  and are responsible for reimbursing such hospitals and physicians for services rendered to their hmo membership 
for of our december  medical membership  we contract with physicians under risk sharing arrangements whereby physicians have assumed some level of risk for all or a portion of the medical costs of their hmo membership 
although these arrangements do include capitation payments for services rendered  we process substantially all of the claims under these arrangements 
physicians under capitation arrangements typically have stop loss coverage so that a physician s financial risk for any single member is limited to a maximum amount on an annual basis 
we remain financially responsible for health care services to our members in the event our providers fail to provide such services

table of contents accreditation assessment our accreditation assessment program consists of several internal programs such as those that credential providers and those designed to meet the audit standards of federal and state agencies and external accreditation standards 
we also offer quality and outcome measurement and improvement programs such as the health plan employer data information sets  or hedis  which is used by employers  government purchasers and the national committee for quality assurance  or ncqa  to evaluate hmos based on various criteria  including effectiveness of care and member satisfaction 
physicians participating in our hmo networks must satisfy specific criteria  including licensing  patient access  office standards  after hours coverage  and other factors 
most participating hospitals also meet accreditation criteria established by cms and or the joint commission on accreditation of healthcare organizations  or jcaho 
recredentialing of participating providers occurs every two to three years  depending on applicable state laws 
recredentialing of participating physicians includes verification of their medical license  review of their malpractice liability claims history  review of their board certification  if applicable  and review of any complaints  including any member appeals and grievances 
committees  composed of a peer group of physicians  review the applications of physicians being considered for credentialing and recredentialing 
we request accreditation for certain of our hmo plans from ncqa and the american accreditation healthcare commission utilization review accreditation commission  or aahc urac 
accreditation or external review by an approved organization is mandatory in the states of florida and kansas for licensure as an hmo 
accreditation specific to the utilization review process is also required in the state of georgia for licensure as an hmo or ppo 
certain commercial businesses  like those impacted by united auto workers contracts and those where the request comes from the employer  require or prefer accredited health plans 
ncqa performs reviews of standards for quality improvement  credentialing  utilization management  and member rights and responsibilities 
we continue to maintain accreditation in select markets through ncqa 
two markets maintain ncqa accredited status for all hmo products humana health plan of ohio  inc in cincinnati  ohio excellent  and humana health plan  inc  kentucky commendable 
humana health plan  inc in kansas and missouri completed the ncqa survey process in november and awaits its decision 
aahc urac performs reviews of standards for utilization management  and for health plan standards in quality management  credentialing  rights and responsibilities  and network management 
several markets have achieved urac health plan accreditation for all hmo products humana medical plan  inc in north florida  south florida  central florida daytona  tampa and orlando  and humana health plan  inc in kansas 
the atlanta market has urac utilization management accreditation for hmo and ppo product lines 
aahc urac utilization management accreditation was received by humana military healthcare services  inc  which administers the tricare program and for the green bay service center 
some of our hmo entities are unaccredited because we sought accreditation only where regulatory requirements were in place  such as in florida  which requires accreditation for hmo licensing  or in market areas where commercial groups use it as part of the criteria for choosing carriers 
we are piloting iso certification as an alternative to accreditation 
iso is the international standards organization  which has developed an international commercial set of certifications as to quality and process  called iso at this time  the following clinical programs have received iso registration transplant management  centralized clinical operations providing personal nurse services  pharmacy management  and disease management 
sales and marketing individuals become members of our commercial hmos and ppos through their employers or other groups which typically offer employees or members a selection of health insurance products  pay for all or part of the 
table of contents premiums and make payroll deductions for any premiums payable by the employees 
we attempt to become an employer s or group s exclusive source of health insurance benefits by offering a variety of hmo  ppo and specialty products that provide cost effective quality health care coverage consistent with the needs and expectations of the employees or members 
beginning in june  we also offer health insurance products to individuals 
we use various methods to market our commercial  medicare choice and medicaid products  including television  radio  the internet  telemarketing  and direct mailings 
at december   we used approximately  licensed independent brokers and agents and approximately licensed employees to sell our commercial products 
many of our employer group customers are represented by insurance brokers and consultants who assist these groups in the design and purchase of health care products 
we generally pay brokers a commission based on premiums  with commissions varying by market and premium volume 
at december   we employed approximately  sales representatives  who are each paid a salary and or per member commission  to market our medicare choice and medicaid products in the continental united states 
we also employed approximately telemarketing representatives who assisted in the marketing of medicare choice and medicaid products by making appointments for sales representatives with prospective members 
risk management through the use of internally developed underwriting criteria  we determine the risk we are willing to assume and the amount of premium to charge for our commercial products 
in most instances  employer and other groups must meet our underwriting standards in order to qualify to contract with us for coverage 
small group reform laws in some states have imposed regulations which provide for guaranteed issue of certain health insurance products and prescribe certain limitations on the variation in rates charged based upon assessment of health conditions 
underwriting techniques are not employed in connection with medicare choice products because cms regulations require us to accept all eligible medicare applicants regardless of their health or prior medical history 
we also are not permitted to employ underwriting criteria for the medicaid product  but rather we follow cms and state requirements 
in addition  with respect to our tricare business  we do not employ any underwriting techniques because we must accept all eligible beneficiaries who choose to participate 
competition the health benefits industry is highly competitive and contracts for the sale of commercial products are generally bid or renewed annually 
our competitors vary by local market and include other managed care companies  national insurance companies  and other hmos and ppos  including hmos and ppos owned by blue cross blue shield plans 
many of our competitors have larger memberships and or greater financial resources than our health plans in the markets in which we compete 
our ability to sell our products and to retain customers is  or may be  influenced by such factors as benefits  pricing  contract terms  number and quality of participating physicians and other providers  utilization review  claims processing  administrative efficiency  relationships with agents  quality of customer service  and accreditation results 
government regulation government regulation of health care products and services is a changing area of law that varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction 
regulatory agencies generally have broad discretion to issue regulations and interpret and enforce laws and rules 
changes in applicable laws and regulations are continually being considered  and the interpretation of existing laws and rules also may change periodically 
these regulatory revisions could affect our operations and financial results 
also  it may become increasingly difficult to control medical costs if federal 
table of contents and state bodies continue to consider and enact significant and sometimes onerous managed care laws and regulations 
enforcement of health care fraud and abuse laws has become a top priority for the nation s law enforcement entities 
the funding of such law enforcement efforts has increased dramatically in the past few years and is expected to continue 
the focus of these efforts has been directed at participants in federal government health care programs such as medicare choice  medicaid  and the federal employee health benefits program  or fehbp 
we participate extensively in these programs and have continued our stringent regulatory compliance efforts for these programs 
the programs are subject to very technical rules 
when combined with law enforcement intolerance for any level of noncompliance  these rules mean that compliance efforts in this area continue to be challenging 
we are subject to various governmental audits  investigations  and enforcement actions 
these include possible government actions relating to the employee retirement income security act  as amended  or erisa  fehbp  federal and state fraud and abuse laws  and other laws relating to medicare choice  including adjusted community rating development  special payment status  and various other areas 
adjusted community rating development is the government defined rating formula used to explain the medicare choice benefits we offer individuals eligible for medicare benefits based on a particular community and certain other factors 
special payment status refers to  among others  medicare choice members who are institutionalized  medicaid eligible  or members who have contracted end stage renal disease 
the medicare choice plan receives a higher payment for members who qualify for one or more of these statuses 
we are currently involved in various government investigations  audits and reviews  some of which are under erisa  and others under the authority of various states departments of insurance 
on may   we entered into a five year corporate integrity agreement with the office of the inspector general for the department of health and human services as part of a settlement of a medicare overpayment issue arising from an audit by the office of the inspector general 
although any of the pending government actions could result in assessment of damages  civil or criminal fines or penalties  and other sanctions against us  including exclusion from participation in government programs  we do not believe the results of any of these actions  individually or in the aggregate  will have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
of our seven licensed and active hmo subsidiaries as of february   five are qualified under the federal health maintenance organization act of  as amended 
to obtain federal qualification  an hmo must meet certain requirements  including conformance with benefit  rating  and financial reporting standards 
as of february   humana medical plan  inc  humana health plan of texas  inc  and humana health plan  inc 
each hold cms contracts under the medicare choice program to sell medicare hmo products in a total of seven states 
in addition  humana insurance company holds cms contracts under a medicare choice program to sell a private fee for service product in eleven states and a pilot ppo product in three counties in florida 
cms conducts audits of hmos qualified under its medicare choice program at least biannually and may perform other reviews more frequently to determine compliance with federal regulations and contractual obligations 
these audits include review of the hmos administration and management  including management information and data collection systems  fiscal stability  utilization management and physician incentive arrangements  health services delivery  quality assurance  marketing  enrollment and disenrollment activity  claims processing  and complaint systems 
cms regulations require submission of quarterly and annual financial statements 
in addition  cms requires certain disclosures to cms and to medicare choice beneficiaries concerning operations of a health plan contracted under the medicare choice program 
cms s rules require disclosure to members upon request of information concerning financial arrangements and incentive plans between an hmo and physicians in the hmos networks 
these rules also require certain levels of stop loss coverage to protect contracted physicians 
table of contents against major losses relating to patient care  depending on the amount of financial risk they assume 
the reporting of certain health care data contained in hedis is another important cms disclosure requirement 
our medicaid products are regulated by the applicable state agency in the state in which we sell a medicaid product and by the health insurance administration in puerto rico  in conformance with federal approval of the applicable state plan  and are subject to periodic reviews by these agencies 
the reviews are similar in nature to those performed by cms 
laws in the commonwealth of puerto rico and each of the states in which we operate our hmos  ppos and other health insurance related services regulate our operations  including the scope of benefits  rate formulas  delivery systems  utilization review procedures  quality assurance  complaint systems  enrollment requirements  claim payments  marketing and advertising 
the hmo  ppo and other health insurance related products we offer are sold under licenses issued by the applicable insurance regulators 
under state laws  our hmos and health insurance companies are audited by state departments of insurance for financial and contractual compliance  and our hmos are audited for compliance with health services standards by respective state departments of health 
most states laws require such audits to be performed at least once every three years 
our licensed subsidiaries are subject to regulation under state insurance holding company and commonwealth of puerto rico regulations 
these regulations generally require  among other things  prior approval and or notice of new products  rates  benefit changes  and certain material transactions  including dividend payments  purchases or sales of assets  intercompany agreements  and the filing of various financial and operational reports 
certain of our subsidiaries operate in states that regulate the payment of dividends  loans  or other cash transfers to humana inc  our parent company  require minimum levels of equity  and limit investments to approved securities 
the amount of dividends that may be paid to humana inc by these subsidiaries  without prior approval by state regulatory authorities  is limited based on the entity s level of statutory income and statutory capital and surplus 
in most states  prior notification is provided before paying a dividend even if approval is not required 
as of december   we maintained aggregate statutory capital and surplus of  million in our state regulated health insurance subsidiaries 
each of these subsidiaries was in compliance with applicable statutory requirements which aggregated million 
although the minimum required levels of equity are largely based on premium volume  product mix  and the quality of assets held  minimum requirements can vary significantly at the state level 
certain states rely on risk based capital requirements  or rbc  to define the required levels of equity 
rbc is a model developed by the national association of insurance commissioners to monitor an entity s solvency 
this calculation indicates recommended minimum levels of required capital and surplus and signals regulatory measures should actual surplus fall below these recommended levels 
if rbc were adopted by all states at december   each of our subsidiaries would be in compliance  and we would have million of aggregate capital and surplus above any of the levels that require corrective action under rbc 
one tricare subsidiary under the regions and contract with the department of defense is required to maintain current assets at least equivalent to its current liabilities 
we were in compliance with this requirement at december  our management works proactively to ensure compliance with all governmental laws and regulations affecting our business 
health care reform there continue to be diverse legislative and regulatory initiatives at both the federal and state levels to affect aspects of the nation s health care system 

table of contents federal on december   president bush signed into law the medicare prescription drug  improvement  and modernization act of  or dima 
dima makes many significant changes to the medicare fee for service and medicare choice programs  as well as other changes to the commercial health insurance marketplace 
most significantly  dima creates a prescription drug benefit for medicare beneficiaries  establishes a new medicare advantage program to replace the medicare choice program  and enacts health savings accounts  or hsas  for non medicare eligible individuals and groups 
in and  older americans will be eligible to purchase a discount card 
low income seniors also will receive an annual subsidy of to further defray drug costs 
distribution of the discount cards is expected in march or april beginning in  medicare beneficiaries will be able to sign up for a stand alone drug plan or join a private health plan that offers drug coverage 
dima adds a new payment methodology for private medicareadvantage plans in this methodology provides another basis of payment equal to of medicare fee for service costs and changes the minimum update to include the greater of or the medicareadvantage growth rate 
the legislation establishes a new medicare private health plan program  called medicareadvantage  to offer regional ppo options beginning in and a continuance of hmo  point of service  ppo those established prior to december   and private fee for service options in defined  local service areas 
the legislation also includes a provision establishing hsa s  tax advantaged savings accounts that can be used to pay for medical expenses incurred by individuals  their spouse  and their dependents 
the health insurance portability and accountability act of  or hipaa  includes administrative provisions directed at simplifying electronic data interchange through standardizing transactions  establishing uniform health care provider  payer  and employer identifiers and seeking protections for confidentiality and security of patient data 
under the new hipaa standard transactions and code sets rules  we have made significant systems enhancements and invested in new technological solutions 
the compliance and enforcement date for standard transactions and code sets rules was october  we have continued to be in compliance with this regulation 
however  as many providers indicated that they could not yet comply  cms stated that covered entities making a good faith effort to comply with hipaa transactions and code set standards would be allowed to implement contingency plans to maintain their operations and cash flows 
on october   we announced implementation of a contingency plan to accept non compliant electronic transactions from our providers 
we will continue to accept and process transactions sent in pre hipaa electronic formats from providers who are showing a good faith effort until all providers and clearinghouses are capable of transmitting fully compliant standards transactions as defined in the hipaa implementation guidelines or until cms begins enforcement of the hipaa electronic data interchange regulations 
we believe that the implementation of our contingency plans has minimized any disruptions in our business operations during this transition 
however  if entities with which we do business do not ultimately comply with the hipaa transactions and code set standards  it could result in disruptions of certain of our business operations 
in addition  congress is evaluating proposals to include establishing additional protections for personal health information  tax credits for the uninsured  proposals to reduce the number of medical errors by health care providers and systems of care  and various state and federal purchasing plans to allow individuals and small employers to purchase health insurance 
many of these proposals may require additional administrative costs to ensure compliance and we are currently assessing their cost and impact on premiums for the future 
state we continue to encounter regulation on health care claims payment practices at the state level 
this legislation and possible future regulation and oversight could expose us to additional liability and penalties 
supplemental legislation includes  among other provisions  claims submission content and electronic submission 

table of contents we view electronic submission as a favorable development that will simplify claims interactions 
a few states are considering proposals that place new limits on insurer contacts with hospitals and physicians 
these proposals include provisions to expand payment disclosure  limit implementation of claims payment procedures  and extend an insurer payment liability where intermediaries fail to pay and restrict recoupment 
some states are proposing the creation of small employer pooled purchasing arrangements 
although these pooled purchasing arrangements may affect the small group market  most of the proposals require these purchasing arrangements to comply with the standard small group market regulations 
similar arrangements enacted in the early s had a very limited affect on the small group insurance market 
a limited number of states are considering additional restrictions on the use of health status in small group rating 
mandate free benefit plans are pending in a number of states 
some of these proposals could allow insurers more flexibility in the use of member cost sharing 
there is activity in some states supporting an expansion of disclosure by hospitals  physicians and other health care providers of quality and charge data either directly to patients or to state agencies that must make it publicly available 
medical malpractice reform is receiving significant attention 
pending medical malpractice reform proposals differ substantially relative to the entities covered by the reforms 
since the substance of the reforms remains under discussion and the scope of covered entities has not been resolved in most states  management is unable to predict future activity under these laws 
we are unable to predict how existing federal or state laws and regulations may be changed or interpreted  what additional laws or regulations affecting our businesses may be enacted or proposed  when and which of the proposed laws will be adopted or what effect any such new laws and regulations will have on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
other captive insurance company we bear general business risks associated with operating our company such as professional and general liability  employee workers compensation  and officer and director errors and omissions risks 
professional and general liability risks may include  for example  medical malpractice claims and disputes with members regarding benefit coverage 
we retain these risks through our wholly owned  consolidated insurance subsidiary 
we reduce exposure to our own general business risks by insuring levels of coverage for losses in excess of our retained limits with a number of third party insurance companies 
we remain liable in the event these insurance companies are unable to pay their portion of the losses 
in an effort to minimize credit risk  we insure our risks with a number of insurance companies having a long history of strong financial ratings 
on january   and again on january   we reduced the amount of coverage purchased from third party insurance carriers and increased the amount of risk we retain due to substantially higher insurance rates 
we provide a detail of the significant assets and liabilities related to our captive insurance subsidiary in note to the consolidated financial statements

we acquired pca by a merger that became effective on september  the three actions were consolidated into a single action entitled in re physician corporation of america securities litigation 
the consolidated complaint alleged that pca and the individual defendants knowingly or recklessly made false and misleading statements in press releases and public filings with respect to the financial and regulatory difficulties of pca s workers compensation business 
the court certified a class on may  on august   the parties entered into an agreement to settle the case for the amount of million

a provision for the settlement was previously made in our financial statements during the fourth quarter of the company had pursued insurance coverage for this matter from two insurers and has settled the matter with one of the insurers who will pursue coverage against the other insurer 
managed care industry purported class action litigation we have been involved in several purported class action lawsuits that are part of a wave of generally similar actions that target the health care payer industry and particularly target managed care companies 
these include a lawsuit against us and nine of our competitors that purports to be brought on behalf of physicians who have 
table of contents treated our members 
as a result of action by the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation jpml  the case was consolidated in the united states district court for the southern district of florida  and has been styled in re managed care litigation 
the plaintiffs assert that we and other defendants improperly paid providers claims and downcoded their claims by paying lesser amounts than they submitted 
the complaint alleges  among other things  multiple violations under the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act  or rico  as well as various breaches of contract and violations of regulations governing the timeliness of claim payments 
we moved to dismiss the complaint on september   and the other defendants filed similar motions thereafter 
on march   the court dismissed certain of the plaintiffs claims pursuant to the defendants several motions to dismiss 
however  the court allowed the plaintiffs to attempt to correct the deficiencies in their complaint with an amended pleading with respect to all of the allegations except a claim under the federal medicare regulations  which was dismissed with prejudice 
the court also left undisturbed the plaintiffs claims for breach of contract 
on march   the plaintiffs filed their amended complaint  which  among other things  added four state or county medical associations as additional plaintiffs 
two of those  the denton county medical society and the texas medical association  purport to bring their actions against us  as well as against several other defendant companies 
the medical association of georgia and the california medical association purport to bring their actions against various other defendant companies 
the associations seek injunctive relief only 
the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint on april  on september   the court granted the plaintiffs request to file a second amended complaint  adding additional plaintiffs  including the florida medical association  which purports to bring its action against all defendants 
on october   the defendants moved to dismiss the second amended complaint 
on december   the court denied the motion 
also on september   the court certified a global class consisting of all medical doctors who provided services to any person insured by any defendant from august   to september  the class includes two subclasses 
a national subclass consists of medical doctors who provided services to any person insured by a defendant when the doctor has a claim against such defendant and is not required to arbitrate that claim 
a california subclass consists of medical doctors who provided services to any person insured in california by any defendant when the doctor was not bound to arbitrate the claim 
on october   the defendants asked the court of appeals for the eleventh circuit to review the class certification decision 
on november   the court of appeals agreed to review the class issue 
the appellate court heard oral argument on september   but no ruling has been issued 
discovery is ongoing  and the court has set a trial date of september  also  on january   the court filed a notice with the jpml that will permit the jpml to decide whether the case should remain in miami  florida for trial or be separately remanded for trial to the courts in which the actions were filed prior to their transfer to and consolidation in miami  florida 
in the case of the company  that would be the united states district court for the western district of kentucky 
in the meantime  two of the defendants  aetna inc and cigna corporation  have entered into settlement agreements which have been approved by the court 
we intend to continue to defend this action vigorously 
other the academy of medicine of cincinnati  the butler county medical society  the northern kentucky medical society  and several physicians filed antitrust suits in state courts in ohio and kentucky against aetna health  inc  humana health plan of ohio  inc  anthem blue cross blue shield  and united healthcare of ohio  inc  alleging that the defendants violated the ohio and kentucky antitrust laws by conspiring to fix the reimbursement rates paid to physicians in the greater cincinnati and northern kentucky region 
each suit sought class certification  damages and injunctive relief 
plaintiffs cited no evidence that any such conspiracy existed  
table of contents but based their allegations on assertions that physicians in the greater cincinnati region are paid less than physicians in other major cities in ohio and kentucky 
on october   we entered into a settlement agreement with the plaintiffs that specified an increase in future reimbursement we pay to a class consisting of physicians in a county area in southern ohio and northern kentucky over the next three years 
we agreed to increase the reimbursement  in the aggregate  subject to certain contingencies  that will increase the amounts paid for physician services over the amounts paid in as follows million in  an additional million in and an additional million in the agreement also provides for a committee to monitor our contracting practices for the period through  with reporting to us if any anticompetitive behavior is believed to have occurred 
the agreement was approved by the courts on december  government audits and other litigation and proceedings in july  the office of the florida attorney general initiated an investigation  apparently relating to some of the same matters that are involved in the managed care industry purported class action litigation described above 
on september   the texas attorney general initiated a similar investigation 
no actions have been filed against us by either state 
these investigations are ongoing  and we have cooperated with the regulators in both states 
on may   we entered into a five year corporate integrity agreement  or cia  with the office of inspector general  or oig  of the department of health and human services 
under the cia  we are obligated to  among other things  provide training  conduct periodic audits and make periodic reports to the oig 
in addition  our business practices are subject to review by various state insurance and health care regulatory authorities and federal regulatory authorities 
there has been increased scrutiny by these regulators of the managed health care companies business practices  including claims payment practices and utilization management practices 
we have been and continue to be subject to such reviews 
some of these have resulted in fines and could require changes in some of our practices and could also result in additional fines or other sanctions 
we also are involved in other lawsuits that arise in the ordinary course of our business operations  including claims of medical malpractice  bad faith  nonacceptance or termination of providers  failure to disclose network discounts  and various other provider arrangements  as well as challenges to subrogation practices 
we also are subject to claims relating to performance of contractual obligations to providers  members  and others  including failure to properly pay claims and challenges to the use of certain software products in processing claims 
pending state and federal legislative activity may increase our exposure for any of these types of claims 
in addition  several courts  including several federal appellate courts  recently have issued decisions which have the effect of eroding the scope of erisa preemption for employer sponsored health plans  thereby exposing us to greater liability for medical negligence claims 
this includes decisions which hold that plans may be liable for medical negligence claims in some situations based solely on medical necessity decisions made in the course of adjudicating claims 
in addition  some courts have issued rulings which make it easier to hold plans liable for medical negligence on the part of network providers on the theory that providers are agents of the plans and that the plans are therefore vicariously liable for the injuries to members by providers 
personal injury claims and claims for extracontractual damages arising from medical benefit denials are covered by insurance from our wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary and excess carriers  except to the extent that claimants seek punitive damages  which may not be covered by insurance in certain states in which insurance coverage for punitive damages is not permitted 
in addition  insurance coverage for all or certain forms of liability has become increasingly costly and may become unavailable or prohibitively expensive in the future 
on january  and again on january   we reduced the amount of coverage purchased from third party insurance carriers and increased the amount of risk we retain due to substantially higher insurance rates 

table of contents we do not believe that any pending or threatened legal actions against us or any pending or threatened audits or investigations by state or federal regulatory agencies will have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
however  the likelihood or outcome of current or future suits  like the purported class action lawsuits described above  or governmental investigations  cannot be accurately predicted with certainty 
in addition  the potential for increased liability for medical negligence arising from claims adjudication  along with the increased litigation that has accompanied the negative publicity and public perception of our industry  adds to this uncertainty 
therefore  such legal actions and government audits and investigations could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations  and cash flows

overview headquartered in louisville  kentucky  humana inc is one of the nation s largest publicly traded health benefits companies  based on our revenues of billion 
we offer coordinated health insurance coverage and related services through a variety of traditional and internet based plans for employer groups  government sponsored programs  and individuals 
as of december   we had approximately million members in our medical insurance programs  as well as approximately million members in our specialty products programs 
in  approximately of our premiums and administrative services fees resulted from members located in florida  illinois  texas  kentucky  and ohio 
during  we derived approximately of our premiums and administrative services fees from contracts with the federal government including two federal government contracts with the department of defense to provide health insurance coverage to tricare beneficiaries and our contracts with the centers for medicare and medicaid services  or cms  to provide health insurance coverage for our medicare choice members 
we manage our business with two segments commercial and government 
the commercial segment consists of members enrolled in products marketed to employer groups and individuals  and includes three lines of business fully insured medical  administrative services only  or aso  and specialty 
the government segment consists of members enrolled in government sponsored programs  and includes three lines of business medicare choice  medicaid  and tricare 
our government segment has produced consistent profits and relatively stable margins for many years 
our business strategy largely revolves around increasing our commercial segment profitability while building on our existing strength in the government segment 
our strategy to increase commercial segment profitability focuses on providing solutions for employers to the rising cost of health care through the use of innovative and consumer choice product designs which are supported by service excellence and industry leading electronic capabilities  including education  tools and technologies provided primarily through the internet 
to that end  we have developed an innovative suite of products styled as smart products 
we believe that these smart products offer the best solution for many employers to the problem of fast rising health care costs for their employees 
although enrollment in our smart products is a relatively modest  members at december   we believe that substantial growth in these products  which may be competitively priced to produce higher margins  is the key for our continuing improvement in the commercial segment 
january sales were approximately  in our smart products 
other important elements which impact our commercial segment profitability are the competitive pricing environment and market conditions 
with respect to pricing  there is the balancing act between sustaining or 
table of contents increasing underwriting margins versus achieving enrollment growth 
with respect to market conditions  there is the impact of economies of scale on administrative overhead 
as a result of the decline in popularity of tightly managed hmos and intensive utilization review procedures  medical costs become increasingly comparable among the larger competitors  with product design and consumer involvement then becoming the more important drivers of medical services consumption 
as a result  administrative expense efficiency is becoming a primary driver of commercial margin sustainability 
in line with that philosophy  we continue to reduce our administrative expense structure  realize administrative expense savings through technology tools  and look at acquisition opportunities that align with our geographic presence and commercial strategy 
in december  we announced that we had reached a definitive agreement with the ochsner clinic foundation of new orleans  louisiana to acquire ochsner health plan 
we believe that this acquisition will enhance our presence in the southern united states  an area growing in population and commercial activity 
in addition to creating a new humana market in new orleans  the ochsner health plan acquisition is expected to facilitate sales opportunities in our existing houston market and is anticipated to make us more attractive to national accounts 
in our government segment  there were two significant developments in first  in august  our subsidiary  humana military healthcare services  or hmhs  was awarded the department of defense s tricare contract to support healthcare delivery to active duty and retired service members and their families in the south region beginning in the south region is one of the three regions in the united states as defined by the department of defense s new contract alignment 
under the terms of the award  hmhs will be the managed care support contractor serving approximately million tricare beneficiaries in tennessee  south carolina  georgia  alabama  mississippi  florida  arkansas  louisiana  oklahoma and texas 
most importantly  procurement of the south region contract positions us to continue our tricare operating margins consistent with the levels we have enjoyed since beginning the tricare program in july second  in december president bush signed medicare modernization legislation that provides stabilization funding for the medicare choice program and may provide longer term opportunities for humana  including the potential to  expand the company s current medicare choice market presence   become a medicareadvantage regional ppo   add an interim drug discount card  and  become a prescription drug standalone plan 
we are evaluating these potential opportunities and anticipate completing our analysis during we believe the new medicare legislation demonstrates the federal government s financial commitment to the private payor program and the commitment to providing health benefits and options to seniors  which should translate to stable  if not increasing  participation from humana in this sector 
during  our revenue increased by almost billion to billion versus billion the previous year 
of the revenue increase was derived from our commercial segment  primarily a result of underwriting our premiums commensurate with underlying medical cost inflation 
the leveraging of this increase in underwriting dollars in excess of administrative and overhead expenses was the primary driver of the increase in our commercial and consolidated pretax profits 
during the second quarter of  we completed a transition from seven service centers to four  which has resulted in continuing administrative efficiencies 
cash flows from operations generated million during  million of which was used to purchase million shares of our common stock at an average price of per share 
we invested million on capital expenditures during we intend for the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to assist in the understanding of our financial statements and related changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year  and the primary factors that accounted for those changes  as well as how certain critical accounting principles and estimates impact our financial statements 

table of contents pending acquisition in december  we reached a definitive agreement to purchase ochsner health plan from ochsner clinic foundation having approximately  commercial medical members  primarily in fully insured large group accounts  and approximately  members in the medicare choice program 
this transaction  which is subject to state regulatory approval  is expected to close in the second quarter of critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements and accompanying notes requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
we continuously evaluate our estimates and those critical accounting policies related primarily to medical cost and revenue recognition as well as accounting for impairments related to our investment securities  goodwill  and long lived assets 
these estimates are based on knowledge of current events and anticipated future events  and accordingly  actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies involve the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
medical expense recognition medical expenses are recognized in the period in which services are provided and include an estimate of the cost of services which have been incurred but not yet reported  or ibnr 
ibnr represents a substantial portion of our medical and other expenses payable as follows december  percentage of total december  percentage of total dollars in thousands ibnr reported claims in process pharmacy and other medical expenses payable total medical and other expenses payable estimating ibnr is complex  involves a significant amount of judgment and represents a material portion of our medical and other expenses payable 
accordingly  it represents a critical accounting estimate 
changes in this estimate can materially affect  either favorably or unfavorably  our results from operations and overall financial position 
for example  a basis point  or percent  change in the estimate of our medical and other expenses payable at december   which represents approximately of total liabilities  would require an adjustment of approximately million in a future period in which a revision in the estimate became known 
we develop our estimate for ibnr using actuarial methodologies and assumptions  primarily based upon historical claim payment and claim receipt patterns  as well as historical medical cost trends 
depending on the period for which incurred claims are estimated  we apply a different method in determining our estimate 
for periods prior to the most recent three months  the key assumption used in estimating our ibnr is that the completion factor pattern remains consistent over a rolling month period after adjusting for known changes in claim inventory levels or known changes in claim payment processes 
the completion factor is a calculation of the percentage of claims incurred during a given period that have historically been adjudicated as of the reporting period 
for the most recent three months  the incurred claims are estimated primarily from a trend analysis based upon per member per month claims trends developed from our historical experience in the preceding months  adjusted for known changes in estimates of recent hospital and drug utilization data  provider contracting changes  changes in benefit levels  product mix  and weekday seasonality 

table of contents the completion factor method is used for the months of incurred claims prior to the most recent three months because the historical percentage of claims processed for those months is at a level sufficient to produce a consistently reliable result 
conversely  for the most recent three months of incurred claims  the volume of claims processed historically is not at a level sufficient to produce a reliable result  which therefore requires us to examine historical trend patterns as the primary method of evaluation 
medical cost trends potentially are more volatile than other segments of the economy 
the drivers of medical cost trends include increases in the utilization of hospital and physician services  prescription drugs  and new medical technologies  as well as the inflationary effect on the cost per unit of each of these expense components 
other external factors such as government mandated benefits or other regulatory changes  catastrophes  and epidemics also may impact medical cost trends 
additionally  as we realign our commercial strategy  we continue to reduce the level of traditional utilization management functions such as pre authorization of services  monitoring of inpatient admissions  and requirements for physician referrals 
other internal factors such as system conversions and claims processing interruptions also may impact our ability to accurately predict estimates of historical completion factors or medical cost trends 
all of these factors are considered in estimating ibnr and in estimating the per member per month claims trend for purposes of determining the reserve for the most recent three months 
each of these factors requires significant judgment by management 
the completion and claims per member per month trend factors are the most significant factors impacting the ibnr estimate 
the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our operating results caused by changes in these factors based on december  data completion factor a claims trend factor b decrease increase in factor increase decrease in medical and other expenses payable decrease increase in factor increase decrease in medical and other expenses payable dollars in thousands a reflects estimated potential changes in medical and other expenses payable caused by changes in completion factors for incurred months prior to the most recent three months 
b reflects estimated potential changes in medical and other expenses payable caused by changes in annualized claims trend used for the estimation of per member per month incurred claims for the most recent three months 
most medical claims are paid within a few months of the member receiving service from a physician or other health care provider 
as a result  these liabilities generally are described as having a short tail  which causes less than of our medical and other expenses payable as of the end of any given period to be outstanding for more than months 
as such  we expect that substantially all of the estimate of medical and other expenses payable will be known and paid during our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best point estimate within a level of confidence required by actuarial standards 
actuarial standards of practice generally require a level of confidence such that the liabilities established for ibnr have a greater probability of being adequate versus being insufficient  or such that the liabilities established for ibnr are sufficient to cover obligations under an assumption of moderately adverse conditions 
adverse conditions are situations in which the actual claims are 
table of contents expected to be higher than the otherwise estimated value of such claims at the time of the estimate 
therefore  in many situations  the claim amounts ultimately settled will be less than the estimate that satisfies the actuarial standards of practice 
ibnr established in connection with our tricare contracts is typically more difficult to estimate than with our other operations  as a result of having more variables which impact the estimate 
such variables include continual changes in the number of eligible beneficiaries  changes in the utilization of military treatment facilities and changes in levels of benefits versus the original contract provisions 
many of these variables are impacted significantly by an increase or decrease in military activity involving the united states armed forces 
our tricare contracts contain risk sharing provisions with the department of defense and with subcontractors  which effectively limit profits and losses when actual claim experience varies from the medical claim amounts included in our annual bids 
additionally  other factors impacting medical claims expenses such as changes in the number of eligible beneficiaries and changes in the level of usage of military treatment facilities result in equitable revenue adjustments through the change order and bid price adjustment process 
as a result of the above contract provisions  the impact of changes in estimates for prior year tricare medical claims payable on our results of operations is reduced substantially  whether positive or negative 
the following table provides a reconciliation of changes in medical and other expenses payable for the years ended december   and in thousands balances at january acquisitions incurred related to current year prior years total incurred paid related to current year prior years total paid balances at december amounts incurred related to prior years vary from previously estimated liabilities as the claims are ultimately settled 
negative amounts reported for incurred related to prior years result from claims being ultimately settled for amounts less than originally estimated favorable development 
positive amounts reported for incurred related to prior years result from claims ultimately being settled for amounts greater than originally estimated unfavorable development 
as summarized in the previous table  claim reserve balances at december  ultimately settled during for million less than the amounts originally estimated  representing of medical claim expenses recorded in during  claim reserve balances at december  ultimately settled for million more than the amounts originally estimated  representing of medical claim expenses recorded in this million increase in the amounts incurred related to prior years was substantially all attributable to our tricare operations and resulted primarily from enhanced benefits enacted for tricare beneficiaries as a result of congressional legislation  the impact of which was not fully determinable at december  as these additional medical expenses were recognized during  we also recognized and received commensurate revenues from the department of defense as a result of change orders and bid price adjustments  or bpas 

table of contents during  claim reserve balances at december  ultimately settled for million less than the amounts originally recorded  representing of medical claim expenses recorded in this million decline in the amounts incurred related to prior years consists of million attributable to our tricare operations with the remaining million primarily resulting from fourth quarter utilization in our commercial medical products ultimately being lower than originally estimated 
the million increase in tricare incurred related to prior years resulted from establishing the reserves resulting from the enhanced benefits for tricare beneficiaries as discussed above as well as lower than originally estimated utilization of medical services by tricare beneficiaries in the second half of revenue recognition we generally establish one year contracts with commercial employer groups  subject to cancellation by the employer group s day written notice 
our contracts with federal or state governments are generally multi year contracts subject to annual renewal provisions with the exception of our medicare choice contracts with the federal government which renew annually 
our commercial contracts establish rates on a per member basis for each month of coverage 
except for tricare contracts discussed in the following section  our government contracts also establish monthly rates per member but may have additional amounts due to us based on items such as age  working status  or specific health issues of the member 
premium revenues and aso fees are estimated by multiplying the membership covered under the various contracts by the contractual rates 
in addition  we adjust revenues for  estimated changes in an employer s enrollment and customers that ultimately may fail to pay 
enrollment changes not yet reported by an employer group  an individual  or the government  also known as retroactive membership adjustments  are based on historical trends 
we monitor the collectibility of specific accounts  the aging of receivables  as well as prevailing and anticipated economic conditions  and reflect any required adjustments in the current period s revenue 
we bill and collect premium and aso fee remittances from employer groups  the federal and state governments  and individual medicare choice members monthly 
premium and aso fee receivables are presented net of allowances for estimated uncollectible accounts and retroactive membership adjustments 
premiums and aso fees received prior to the period members are entitled to receive services are recorded as unearned revenues 
tricare revenues base premium revenues as originally specified in our tricare contracts are recognized ratably throughout each contract year as eligible beneficiaries are entitled to receive services 
tricare revenues also include amounts recoverable from the federal government as a result of bpas and change orders 
under our tricare contracts  we retain the financial risk of contractual discounts in the provider networks  same store utilization of services  and administrative overhead 
however  the federal government retains the financial risk associated with changes in usage levels at military treatment facilities  or mtfs  changes in the number of persons eligible for tricare benefits  and medical unit cost inflation 
bpas are utilized to retroactively adjust premium revenues for the impact of the items for which the federal government retains risk 
we work closely with the federal government to obtain and review eligibility and mtf workload data  and to quantify and negotiate amounts recoverable or payable under our contractual bpa requirements 
we record revenues applicable to bpas when these amounts are determinable and the collectibility is reasonably assured 
because final settlement of bpas occurs only at specified intervals  typically in excess of months after the end of a contract year for our largest regions  cumulative amounts receivable or payable under bpas may be outstanding in excess of a year 
amounts receivable or payable within a year are classified as premiums receivable or trade accounts payable and accrued expenses  respectively  in our consolidated balance sheets 
amounts receivable or payable for longer than one year are classified as other long term assets or other long term liabilities  respectively 
the increase in activity and deployments surrounding military conflicts in the middle east has significantly impacted bpa activity in recent years 

table of contents tricare change orders occur when we perform services or incur costs under the directive of the federal government that were not originally specified in our contracts 
under federal regulations we are entitled to an equitable adjustment to the contract price  which results in additional premium revenues 
examples of items that have necessitated substantial change orders in recent years include congressionally legislated increases in the level of benefits for tricare beneficiaries and the administration of new government programs such as tricare for life and tricare senior pharmacy 
like bpas  we record revenue applicable to change orders when these amounts are determinable and the collectibility is reasonably assured 
unlike bpas  where settlement only occurs at specified intervals  change orders may be negotiated and settled at any time throughout the year 
total tricare premium and aso fee receivables were as follows at december  and in thousands tricare premiums receivable base receivable bid price adjustments bpas change orders subtotal less long term portion of bpas total tricare premiums receivable tricare aso fees receivable base receivable change orders total tricare aso fees receivable our tricare contracts also contain risk sharing provisions with the federal government to minimize any losses and limit any profits in the event that medical costs for which we are at risk differ from the levels targeted in our contracts 
amounts receivable from the federal government under such risk sharing provisions are included in the bpa receivable above  while amounts payable to the federal government under these provisions of approximately million at december  are included in medical and other expenses payable in our consolidated balance sheets 
investment securities investment securities totaled  million  or of total assets at december  debt securities totaled  million  or of our total investment portfolio 
more than of our debt securities were of investment grade quality  with an average credit rating of aa by standard poor s at december  most of the debt securities that are below investment grade are rated at the higher end b or better of the non investment grade spectrum 
our investment policy limits investments in a single issuer and requires diversification among various asset types 
duration is indicative of the relationship between changes in market value to changes in interest rates  providing a general indication of the sensitivity of the fair values of our debt securities to changes in interest rates 
however  actual market values may differ significantly from estimates based on duration 
the average duration of our debt securities was approximately years at december  based on this duration  a increase in interest rates would generally decrease the fair value of our debt securities by approximately million 
our investment securities are categorized as available for sale and  as a result  are stated at fair value 
fair value of publicly traded debt and equity securities are based on quoted market prices 
non traded debt securities are priced independently by a third party vendor 
fair value of venture capital debt securities that are privately 
table of contents held  or where an observable quoted market price does not exist  are estimated using a variety of valuation methodologies 
such methodologies include reviewing the value ascribed to the most recent financing  comparing the security with securities of publicly traded companies in a similar line of business  and reviewing the underlying financial performance including estimating discounted cash flows 
unrealized holding gains and losses  net of applicable deferred taxes  are included as a component of stockholders equity until realized from a sale or impairment 
gross unrealized losses and fair value  aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position at december   included the following less than months months or more total fair value unrealized losses fair value unrealized losses fair value unrealized losses in thousands us government obligations tax exempt municipal securities corporate and other securities mortgage backed securities redeemable preferred stocks debt securities equity securities long term investment securities we regularly evaluate our investment securities for impairment 
we consider factors affecting the investee  factors affecting the industry the investee operates within  and general debt and equity market trends 
we consider the length of time an investment s fair value has been below carrying value  the near term prospects for recovery to carrying value and our intent and ability to hold the investment until maturity or market recovery is realized 
if and when a determination is made that a decline in fair value below the cost basis is other than temporary  the related investment is written down to its estimated fair value through earnings 
the risks inherent in assessing the impairment of an investment include the risk that market factors may differ from our expectations  facts and circumstances factored into our assessment may change with the passage of time  or we may decide to subsequently sell the investment 
the determination of whether a decline in the value of an investment is other than temporary requires us to exercise significant diligence and judgment 
the discovery of new information and the passage of time can significantly change these judgments 
the status of the general economic environment and significant changes in the national securities markets influence the determination of fair value and the assessment of investment impairment 
unrealized losses at december  resulted from positions 
less than of the carrying value of our consolidated investment securities have been in an unrealized loss position greater than one year 
the unrealized losses at december  generally can be attributed to changes in interest rates 
all securities trading at an unrealized loss remain current on all contractual payments and we believe it is probable that we will be able to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the debt securities 
after taking into account these and other factors  including our ability and intent to hold these securities until recovery or maturity  we determined the unrealized losses on these investment securities were temporary 
we recorded impairment losses of million in  million in  and million in after an evaluation indicated that a decline in fair value below the cost basis was other than temporary 
goodwill and long lived asset at december   goodwill and other long lived assets represented of total assets and of total stockholders equity 

table of contents in accordance with the adoption of an accounting standard on january   as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  goodwill is no longer amortized but must be tested at least annually for impairment at a level of reporting referred to as the reporting unit and more frequently if adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired 
a reporting unit is one level below our commercial and government segments 
the commercial segment s two reporting units consist of fully and self insured medical and specialty 
the government segment s three reporting units consist of medicare choice  tricare and medicaid 
goodwill was assigned to the reporting unit that was expected to benefit from a specific acquisition 
if goodwill was expected to benefit multiple reporting units  we allocated goodwill in connection with our transitional impairment test as of january  based upon the reporting units relative fair value 
this process resulted in the allocation of million of goodwill to the commercial segment and million of goodwill to the government segment 
our strategy  long range business plan  and annual planning process supports our goodwill impairment tests 
these tests are based primarily on an evaluation of future discounted cash flows under several scenarios 
we used a range of discount rates that correspond to our weighted average cost of capital 
key assumptions including changes in membership  premium yields  medical cost trends and certain government contract extensions are consistent with those utilized in our long range business plan and annual planning process 
if these assumptions differ from actual  the estimates underlying our goodwill impairment tests could be adversely affected 
long lived assets consist of property and equipment and other intangible assets 
these assets are depreciated or amortized over their estimated useful life  and are subject to impairment reviews 
we periodically review long lived assets whenever adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
in assessing recoverability  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine if an impairment loss may exist  and  if so  estimate fair value 
we also must estimate and make assumptions regarding the useful life we assign to our long lived assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment losses or change the useful life  including accelerating depreciation for these assets 
we recognized losses due to impairment and accelerated depreciation from changes in estimated useful life of million in  million in and none in see note to the consolidated financial statements 
recently issued accounting pronouncements on december   the staff of the securities and exchange commission sec or the staff issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  or sab  which supercedes staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  or sab sab s primary purpose is to rescind accounting guidance contained in sab related to multiple element revenue arrangements  superceded as a result of the issuance of eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables

table of contents overview net income was million  or per diluted share  in compared to net income of million  or per diluted share  in the increase in earnings resulted primarily from significant improvement in operating earnings for the commercial segment and a decrease in expenses for asset impairments and other unusual items 
premium revenues and medical membership premium revenues increased  to billion  for compared to billion for higher premium revenues resulted primarily from increases in fully insured commercial per member premiums and an increase in tricare premiums 
items impacting per member premiums include changes in premium and government reimbursement rates  as well as changes in geographic mix of membership  the mix of product offerings  and the mix of benefit plans selected by our membership 
commercial segment premium revenues increased  to billion  for compared to billion for this improvement resulted primarily from increases in per member premiums in the to range for on our fully insured commercial business 
additionally  our fully insured commercial medical membership increased or  members  to  at december  compared to  at december  we anticipate commercial fully insured per member premiums will increase approximately to 
this reduction in the rate of increase in commercial fully insured per member premiums is expected to occur as a result of a changing mix of business  reductions in the level of benefits purchased by our customers  and a more competitive pricing environment 
the change in the mix of business  which is expected to result from growth in our individual products and changes in the products purchased by our large group customers  and reductions in the level of benefit purchased will result in a commensurate reduction in medical cost trends 
we expect commercial fully insured and aso medical membership to achieve a combined increase for all of of between and  with most of the growth occurring in the aso business 
government segment premium revenues increased  to billion  for compared to billion for this increase primarily was attributable to our tricare business  partially offset by a reduction in our medicare choice membership

we expect the commercial segment mer to increase between to basis points in primarily due to competitive pricing pressures and the pass through of increased administrative expense efficiencies to customers in the form of lower rates 
the government segment medical expense ratio for was  increasing basis points from for this increase primarily was attributable to tricare as a result of having a higher level of bpa activity in the prior year 
sg a expense total selling  general and administrative  or sg a  expenses as a percentage of premium revenues and administrative services fees  or sg a expense ratio  decreased basis points in primarily because of a decrease in severance and related employee benefit costs of million  the absence of expenses of million associated with a contingent contractual provider dispute and other items  offset by an increase in building impairments of million 
increased operating efficiency led to the consolidation of seven service centers into four and an enterprise wide workforce reduction affecting administrative expenses in both and by recording expenses for severance and related employee benefit costs and building impairments 
severance and related employee benefit costs  more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements  amounted to million in and million in the severance amount primarily related to the service center consolidation 
building impairments  more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements  amounted to million in and million in during  we recorded million of administrative expenses for a contingent contractual provider dispute and other items associated with our acquisition of physician corporation of america  or pca 
the million of expenses in resulted from three issues 
first  on january   we settled a dispute with a provider for million primarily regarding old claims of pca subsidiaries dating prior to humana s acquisition 
second  during the fourth quarter of  as a december  trial date approached  efforts intensified to reach settlement of an old pca shareholder dispute for periods prior to humana s acquisition of pca 
as a result  we accrued million because the loss was probable and the amount could be reasonably estimated 
we reversed million of this reserve when the final settlement was paid during the third quarter of third  in connection with an agreement reached in november  we partially wrote off a note receivable of million from the purchaser of our workers compensation business which was sold in the agreement with the purchaser resulted when a significant customer contract was terminated in the fourth quarter of we acquired the workers compensation business in connection with the pca acquisition

income taxes our effective tax rate in of increased compared to the effective tax rate in the increase in the effective tax rate primarily resulted from a lower proportion of tax exempt investment income to pretax income 
during  the internal revenue service completed their audit of all open years prior to which resulted in a favorable adjustment to the estimated accrual for income taxes of approximately million 
this was offset by an increase of approximately million in the capital loss valuation allowance after we reevaluated probable capital gain realization in the allowable carryforward period based upon our capital gain experience beginning in and consideration of alternative tax planning strategies

increasing premium revenues recorded in connection with bpas resulted from an increase in the number of eligible tricare beneficiaries and a decrease in the use of military treatment facilities  or mtfs  by tricare beneficiaries 
the number of tricare beneficiaries increased in as a result of the events of september   the subsequent build up of military personnel to support military operations in afghanistan  and the continuing build up of military personnel surrounding other international tensions 
a decline in the usage of mtfs occurred for some periods after september  when certain mtfs were restricted by the department of defense resulting in a greater use of our provider network by retired military personnel and the dependents of both active duty and retired military personnel 
increasing premium revenues recorded in connection with change orders primarily resulted from expanded benefits for tricare beneficiaries as mandated by congress which includes  among other items  a reduction of the beneficiary out of pocket maximum cost and the elimination of certain copayments 
collectively  all of these actions resulted in higher medical expenses during since these actions were not originally specified in our contracts  we were entitled to equitable revenue adjustments via the change order and bpa process

liquidity our consolidated liquidity continued to strengthen in  with cash and cash equivalents increasing to million at december  from million at december  because we operate as a holding company  our parent company is dependent upon dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from our subsidiaries  most of which are subject to regulatory restrictions 
our parent company liquidity also improved during cash  cash equivalents and short term investments at our parent company amounted to million at december   increasing million from million at december  the primary source for the increase in cash and cash equivalents has been the increase in our net income 
the change in cash and cash equivalents for the years ended december   and is summarized as follows in thousands net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents 
table of contents the primary drivers of operating cash flow in our business are premium collections and medical claim payments 
because premiums generally are collected in advance of claims payments by a period up to several months in many instances  our business should normally produce strong cash flows during a period of increasing enrollment 
conversely  cash flows would be negatively impacted during a period of shrinking enrollment  as was the case for us during the exception to this general rule is the collection of tricare bpas and change orders  which may occur up to six months after the end of a contract year 
other activities that impact our cash flows are the collection of aso fees and investment income and the payment of operating expenses  interest expense and taxes 
during  our operating cash flows were not substantially impacted by a change in the timing of premium and aso fee collections or medical claim payments  as both amounts generally increased with inflation and membership growth 
however  during  our operating cash flows were negatively impacted by slower cash collections of premium and aso fee receivables when tricare receivables increased by million as detailed in the following table december  change in thousands tricare base receivable bid price adjustments bpas change orders less long term portion of bpas tricare subtotal commercial and other allowance for doubtful accounts total net receivables tricare base receivables  which are collected monthly in the ordinary course of business  increased in as rates under our base tricare contract increased upon the annual renewal of the contracts for regions and and regions and total tricare receivables significantly increased from to primarily due to change orders and bpas due to an increase in activity and deployments surrounding military conflicts in the middle east 
the timing of payments for claims can significantly impact comparisons of our operating cash flows between years 
during  operating cash flows were reduced by million as a result of our paying down unprocessed claim inventories 
since then  the level of claims inventory has stabilized 
the following table presents the estimated valuation and number of unprocessed claims on hand  performance metrics we regularly review 
claims on hand represent the estimated number of provider requests for reimbursement that have been received but not yet processed 
estimated valuation claims on hand number of days claims on hand dollars in thousands december  december  december  december  
table of contents medical and other expenses payable increased during and due primarily to medical claims inflation and increases in membership 
the timing of claim payments did not significantly impact or cash flows from operations 
the detail of medical and other expenses payable was as follows at december    and change in thousands ibnr unprocessed claim inventories processed claim inventories payable to pharmacy benefit administrator and other total medical and other expenses payable ibnr represents an estimate of medical expenses payable for claims incurred but not reported ibnr at the balance sheet date 
the level of ibnr is primarily impacted by membership levels  medical claim trends and the receipt cycle time  which represents the length of time between when a claim is initially incurred and when the claim form is received ie a shorter time span results in a lower ibnr 
unprocessed claim inventories represent the estimated valuation of claims received but not yet fully processed 
further detail regarding unprocessed claim inventories is provided below 
processed claim inventories represent the estimated valuation of processed claims that are in the post claim adjudication process  which consists of administrative functions such as audit and check batching and handling 
the balance due to our pharmacy benefit administrator fluctuates due to bi weekly payments and the month end cutoff and other medical expenses payable 
the timing of medicare choice premium receipts may significantly impact our cash flows from operations in a particular period as the medicare choice premium receipt is payable to us on the first day of each month 
when the first day of a month falls on a weekend or holiday  we receive this payment at the end of the previous month 
since this amount is significant  the timing of its receipt can cause a material fluctuation in our operating cash flows from period to period 
the medicare choice premium receipts for january of million and for january of million were received early in december and december  respectively  because january is a holiday 
this timing accounts for a significant portion of the unearned revenues balance on our consolidated balance sheets at december  and cash flow from investing activities during  we reinvested a portion of our operating cash flows in investment securities  primarily short duration fixed income securities  totaling million 
during  and  we also made capital expenditures as discussed below 
cash flow from financing activities during  we converted our short term commercial paper debt to long term borrowings and repurchased common shares as discussed below 
the cash used in financing activities in resulted primarily from common share repurchases while the use of cash in resulted from reductions in borrowings 
capital expenditures our ongoing capital expenditures primarily relate to our technology initiatives and administrative facilities necessary for activities such as claims processing  billing and collections  medical utilization review  and customer service 
total capital expenditures  excluding acquisitions  were million in  million

of these shares  million were acquired in connection with employee stock plans at an aggregate cost of million  or an average of per share  and the remaining million shares were acquired in open market transactions at an aggregate cost of million  or an average of per share 
in july  the board of directors authorized an additional use of up to million for the repurchase of our common shares exclusive of shares repurchased in connection with employee stock plans 
the shares may be purchased from time to time at prevailing prices in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions

the net proceeds were used for general corporate purposes  including the funding of our short term cash needs 
in order to hedge the risk of changes in the fair value of our million senior notes and our million senior notes attributable to fluctuations in interest rates  we entered into interest rate swap agreements 
interest rate swap agreements  which are considered derivatives  are contracts that exchange interest payments on a specified principal amount  or notional amount  for a specified period 
the interest rate swap agreements have the same critical terms as our senior notes and our senior notes 
changes in the fair value of the or senior notes and the swap agreements due to changing interest rates are assumed to offset each other completely  resulting in no impact to earnings from hedge ineffectiveness 
our swap agreements are recognized in our consolidated balance sheet at fair value with an equal and offsetting adjustment to the carrying value of our senior notes 
the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements are estimated based 
table of contents on quoted market prices of comparable agreements  and reflect the amounts we would receive or pay to terminate the agreements at the reporting date 
our interest rate swap agreements exchange the fixed interest rate under our and senior notes for a variable interest rate 
at december   the variable interest rate was for the senior notes and for the senior notes 
the million swap agreements for the senior notes mature on august   and the million swap agreements for the senior notes mature on august   and each has the same critical terms as the related senior notes 
in june  we recorded a deferred gain and received proceeds of million in exchange for new swap agreements discussed above related to our senior notes 
the corresponding deferred swap gain of million is being amortized to reduce interest expense over the remaining term of the senior notes 
the carrying value of our senior notes has been increased million by the remaining deferred swap gain balance at december  at december   the million fair value of our swap agreements is included in other long term assets 
likewise  the carrying value of our senior notes has been increased million to reflect its fair value 
the counterparties to our swap agreements are major financial institutions with which we also have other financial relationships 
credit agreements we maintain two unsecured revolving credit agreements consisting of a million  year revolving credit agreement and a million  day revolving credit agreement with a one year term out option 
a one year term out option converts the outstanding borrowings  if any  under the credit agreement to a one year term loan upon expiration 
the year revolving credit agreement expires in october in october  we renewed the day revolving credit agreement which expires in october  unless extended 
there were no balances outstanding under either agreement at december  or under these agreements  at our option  we can borrow on either a competitive advance basis or a revolving credit basis 
the revolving credit portion of both agreements bears interest at either a fixed rate or floating rate based on libor plus a spread 
the spread  which varies depending on our credit ratings  ranges from to basis points for our year agreement  and to basis points for our day agreement 
we also pay an annual facility fee regardless of utilization 
this facility fee  currently basis points  may fluctuate between and basis points  depending upon our credit ratings 
the competitive advance portion of any borrowings under either credit agreement will bear interest at market rates prevailing at the time of borrowing on either a fixed rate or a floating rate basis  at our option 
these credit agreements  and the agreement relating to the conduit commercial paper program described below  contain customary restrictive and financial covenants as well as customary events of default  including financial covenants regarding the maintenance of net worth  minimum interest coverage  and maximum leverage ratios 
at december   we were in compliance with all applicable financial covenant requirements 
the terms of each of these credit agreements also include standard provisions related to conditions of borrowing  including a customary material adverse effect clause which could limit our ability to borrow 
we have not experienced a material adverse effect and we know of no circumstances or events which would be reasonably likely to result in a material adverse effect 
we do not believe the material adverse effect clause poses a material funding risk to humana in the future 
commercial paper programs we maintain indirect access to the commercial paper market through our conduit commercial paper financing program 
under this program  a third party issues commercial paper and loans the proceeds of those issuances to us so that the interest and principal payments on the loans match those on the underlying commercial 
table of contents paper 
the million  day revolving credit agreement supports the conduit commercial paper financing program of up to million 
we also maintain and may issue short term debt securities under a commercial paper program when market conditions allow 
the program is backed by our credit agreements described above 
under the terms of our credit agreements  aggregate borrowings under both the credit agreements and commercial paper program cannot exceed million 
at december   we had no direct or indirect conduit commercial paper borrowings outstanding 
other borrowings other borrowings of million at december  and million at december  represent financing for the renovation of a building  bear interest at per annum  are collateralized by the building  and are payable in various installments through shelf registration on april   our universal shelf registration became effective with the securities and exchange commission 
this allows us to register debt or equity securities  from time to time  with the amount  price and terms to be determined at the time of the sale 
after the issuance of our million  senior notes in august  we have up to million remaining from a total of million under the universal shelf registration 
the universal shelf registration allows us to use the net proceeds from any future sales of our securities for our operations and for other general corporate purposes  including repayment or refinancing of borrowings  working capital  capital expenditures  investments  acquisitions  or the repurchase of our outstanding securities 
contractual obligations we are contractually obligated to make payments for years subsequent to december  as follows payments due by period total less than year years years more than years in thousands debt operating leases purchase and other obligations total debt payments could be accelerated upon violation of debt covenants 
we believe the likelihood of a debt covenant violation is remote 
we lease facilities  computer hardware  and other equipment under long term operating leases that are noncancelable and expire on various dates through we sublease facilities or partial facilities to third party tenants for space not used in our operations which partially mitigates our operating lease commitments 
an operating lease is a type of off balance sheet arrangement 
assuming we acquired the asset  rather than leased  we would have recognized a liability for the financing of these assets 
see also note to the consolidated financial statements 
purchase and other obligations include agreements to purchase services  primarily information technology related services  or to make improvements to real estate that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum levels of service to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the appropriate timing of the transaction 
purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements our year and year airplane operating leases provide for a residual value payment of no more than million at the end of the lease terms  which expire december  for the year lease and january  for the year lease 
we have the right to exercise a purchase option with respect to the leased airplanes or the airplanes can be sold to a third party 
if we decide not to exercise our purchase option at the end of the lease  we must pay the lessor a maximum amount of million related to the year lease and million related to the year lease 
the amount will be reduced by the net sales proceeds of the airplanes to a third party 
after considering the current fair value of the airplanes  we recorded a million provision during for the exposure from the residual value guarantee 
during  we terminated two year airplane leases early 
the impact of these transactions was not material 
indemnifications and guarantees through indemnity agreements approved by the state regulatory authorities  certain of our regulated subsidiaries generally are guaranteed by humana inc  our parent company  in the event of insolvency for  member coverage for which premium payment has been made prior to insolvency   benefits for members then hospitalized until discharged  and  payment to providers for services rendered prior to insolvency 
our parent also has guaranteed the obligations of our tricare subsidiaries 
in the ordinary course of business  we enter into contractual arrangements under which we may agree to indemnify a third party to such arrangement from any losses incurred relating to the services they perform on behalf of us  or for losses arising from certain events as defined within the particular contract  which may include  for example  litigation or claims relating to past performance 
such indemnification obligations may not be subject to maximum loss clauses 
historically  payments made related to these indemnifications have been immaterial 
other liquidity factors our investment grade credit rating at december  was baa according to moody s investors services  inc  or moody s  and bbb  according to standard poor s corporation  or s p 
a downgrade to ba or lower by moody s and bb or lower by s p would give the counterparties of three of our interest rate swap agreements with a million notional amount  the right  but not the obligation  to cancel the interest rate swap agreement 
if cancelled  we would pay or receive an amount based on the fair market value of the swap agreement 
assuming these swap agreements had been cancelled on december   we would have received million 
other than the swap agreements  adverse changes in our credit ratings will not create  increase  or accelerate any liabilities 
adverse changes in our credit rating will increase the rate of interest we pay and may impact the amount of credit available to us in the future 
related parties no related party transactions had a material effect on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
certain immaterial related party transactions are discussed in our proxy statement for the meeting to be held april  see certain transactions with management and others 
regulatory requirements certain of our subsidiaries operate in states that regulate the payment of dividends  loans  or other cash transfers to humana inc  our parent company  require minimum levels of equity as well as limit investments to approved securities 
the amount of dividends that may be paid to humana inc by these subsidiaries  without prior approval by state regulatory authorities  is limited based on the entity s level of statutory income and statutory capital and surplus 
in most states  prior notification is provided before paying a dividend even if approval is not required 

table of contents as of december   we maintained aggregate statutory capital and surplus of  million in our state regulated health insurance subsidiaries 
each of these subsidiaries was in compliance with applicable statutory requirements which aggregated million 
although the minimum required levels of equity are largely based on premium volume  product mix  and the quality of assets held  minimum requirements can vary significantly at the state level 
certain states rely on risk based capital requirements  or rbc  to define the required levels of equity 
rbc is a model developed by the national association of insurance commissioners to monitor an entity s solvency 
this calculation indicates recommended minimum levels of required capital and surplus and signals regulatory measures should actual surplus fall below these recommended levels 
if rbc were adopted by all states at december   each of our subsidiaries would be in compliance and we would have million of aggregate capital and surplus above any of the levels that require corrective action under rbc 
one tricare subsidiary under the regions and contract with the department of defense is required to maintain current assets at least equivalent to its current liabilities 
we were in compliance with this requirement at december  future liquidity needs because of the items discussed in this liquidity section  we believe that funds from future operating cash flows and funds available under our credit agreements and commercial paper program are sufficient to meet short and intermediate term liquidity needs 
we also believe these sources of funds are adequate to allow us to fund selected expansion opportunities  as well as to fund capital requirements 
market risk sensitive financial instruments and positions the level of our pretax earnings is subject to risk due to changes in investment income from our fixed income portfolio which is partially offset by both our debt position and the short term duration of the fixed income investment portfolio 
we evaluated the impact on our investment income and debt expense resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates of  and basis points over the next twelve month period  as reflected in the following table 
the modeling technique used to calculate the pro forma net change in pretax earnings considered the cash flows related to fixed income investments and debt  which are subject to interest rate changes during a prospective twelve month period 
this evaluation measures parallel shifts in interest rates and may not account for certain unpredictable events that may effect interest income  including  among others  unexpected changes of cash flow into and out of the portfolio  shifts in the asset mix between tax and tax exempt securities  and spread changes specific to various investment categories 
in the past ten years  changes in month libor rates during the year have exceeded basis points twice  have not changed between and basis points  have changed between and basis points once and have changed by less than basis points seven times 
libor was at december  our model assumed the maximum possible reduction in libor could not exceed basis points

table of contents government contracts our medicareadvantage contracts with the federal government are renewed for a one year term each december unless notice of termination is received at least days prior thereto 
in december  the medicare prescription drug  improvement  and modernization act  or dima  was signed into law 
dima includes provisions that require the stabilization funding to be directed toward increased reimbursement for providers  increased benefits or access for members  or decreased member premiums 
we believe dima will open new opportunities for us 
however  we do not believe that the benefit to our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows will be material 
our current tricare contract with the department of defense will be in effect until april  for regions and and until june  for regions and each of the contracts is subject to a one year renewal at the government s option 
we believe these contracts will continue until the tricare transition described below 
on august   the department of defense notified us that we were awarded the contract for the south region  one of three newly created regions under the government s revised tricare program 
the current tricare regions and will become part of the new south region along with region  which is currently administered by another contractor 
the current regions and will become part of the north region  which was awarded to another contractor 
pursuant to the department of defense s bid process  each of the three awards was subject to protests by unsuccessful bidders of prime contracts  however  none of the protests were successful 
under the department of defense s current schedule for implementation of the new tricare contracts  regions and will transition to the new north region for the start of healthcare delivery on july  regions and will become part of the new south region for the start of healthcare delivery on august  and region will become part of our new south region for the start of healthcare delivery on november  if this schedule is realized  our tricare membership is expected to temporarily decline to million in july  and is expected to increase to million in november this will also result in a decline in revenues during this period 
in addition  retail pharmacy benefits for tricare beneficiaries will be administered separately under the new department of defense tricare retail pharmacy program 
on september   we were notified that we were not awarded the retail pharmacy contract and  later  that our protest of this award decision was not upheld 
we currently have medicaid contracts with the puerto rico health insurance administration through june   subject to each party agreeing upon annual rates 
in july  we signed amendments to the puerto rico medicaid contracts regarding a premium rate increase for the annual period ending june  our other medicaid contracts are in florida and illinois  and are annual contracts 
as of december   puerto rico accounted for approximately of our total medicaid membership 
other than as described herein  the loss of any of our existing or pending government contracts or significant changes in these programs as a result of legislative action  including reductions in premium payments to us  or increases in member benefits without corresponding increases in premium payments to us  may have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
legal proceedings we are party to a variety of legal actions in the ordinary course of business  including employment matters  breach of contract actions  tort claims  and shareholder suits involving alleged securities fraud 
a description of material legal actions in which we are currently involved is included under legal proceedings of item in 
table of contents part we cannot predict the outcome of these suits with certainty  and we are incurring expenses in defense of these matters 
in addition  recent court decisions and legislative activity may increase our exposure for any of these types of claims 
therefore  these legal actions could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
cautionary statements this document includes both historical and forward looking statements 
the forward looking statements are made within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of we intend such forward looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward looking statements contained in the private securities litigation reform act of  and we are including this statement for purposes of complying with these safe harbor provisions 
we have based these forward looking statements on our current expectations and projections about future events  trends and uncertainties 
these forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks  uncertainties and assumptions  including  among other things  the information discussed below 
in making these statements  we are not undertaking to address or update each factor in future filings or communications regarding our business or results 
our business is highly complicated  regulated and competitive with many different factors affecting results 
if the premiums we charge are insufficient to cover the cost of health care services delivered to our members  or if our estimates of medical claim reserves based upon our estimates of future medical claims are inadequate  our profitability could decline 
we use a significant portion of our revenues to pay the costs of health care services delivered to our members 
these costs include claims payments  capitation payments  allocations of some centralized expenses and various other costs incurred to provide health insurance coverage to our members 
these costs also include estimates of future payments to hospitals and others for medical care provided to our members 
generally  premiums in the health care business are fixed for one year periods 
accordingly  costs we incur in excess of our medical cost projections generally are not recovered in the contract year through higher premiums 
we estimate the costs of our future medical claims and other expenses using actuarial methods and assumptions based upon claim payment patterns  medical inflation  historical developments  including claim inventory levels and claim receipt patterns  and other relevant factors 
we also record medical claims reserves for future payments 
we continually review estimates of future payments relating to medical claims costs for services incurred in the current and prior periods and make necessary adjustments to our reserves 
however  increases in the use or cost of services by our members  competition  government regulations and many other factors may and often do cause actual health care costs to exceed what was estimated and reflected in premiums 
these factors may include increased use of medical facilities and services  including prescription drugs  increased cost of such services  the company s membership mix  termination of capitation arrangements resulting in the transfer of membership to fee for service arrangements  changes or reductions of our utilization management functions such as preauthorization of services  concurrent review or requirements for physician referrals  catastrophes  including acts of terrorism or epidemics  the introduction of new or costly treatments  including new technologies  
table of contents medical cost inflation  and new government mandated benefits or other regulatory changes 
failure to adequately price our products or estimate sufficient medical claim reserves may result in a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
if we do not design and price our products properly and competitively  our membership and profitability could decline 
we are in a highly competitive industry 
many of our competitors are more established in the health care industry and have a larger market share and greater financial resources than we do in some markets 
in addition  other companies may enter our markets in the future  including emerging competitors in the medicareadvantage program  in e commerce insurance or benefit programs and in consumer directed health plans 
contracts for the sale of commercial products are generally bid upon or renewed annually 
while health plans compete on the basis of many factors  including service and the quality and depth of provider networks  we expect that price will continue to be a significant basis of competition 
in addition to the challenge of controlling health care costs  we face competitive pressure to contain premium prices 
premium increases  introduction of new product designs  and our relationship with our providers in various markets  among other issues  could affect our membership levels 
other actions that could affect membership levels include the possible exit of or entrance to medicareadvantage or commercial markets 
if we do not compete effectively in our markets  if we set rates too high or too low in highly competitive markets to keep or increase our market share  if membership does not increase as we expect  or if it declines  or if we lose accounts with favorable medical cost experience while retaining or increasing membership in accounts with unfavorable medical cost experience  our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
if we fail to effectively implement our operational and strategic initiatives  our business could be materially adversely affected 
our future performance depends in large part upon our management team s ability to execute our strategy to position the company for the future 
this strategy includes the growth of our commercial segment business  introduction of new products and benefit designs  including our smart products  the successful implementation of our e business initiatives and the selection and adoption of new technologies 
we believe that the adoption of new technologies will contribute toward a reduction in administrative costs as we more closely align our workforce with our membership 
this alignment is achieved through reductions in workforce or by employing additional people in certain strategic operating areas such as sales and underwriting 
additionally  we have consolidated our service centers and their related systems as part of our operational initiatives 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement our operational and strategic initiatives that are intended to position the company for future growth 
failure to implement this strategy may result in a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
if we fail to properly maintain the integrity of our data  or to strategically implement new information systems  or to protect our proprietary rights to our systems  our business could be materially adversely affected 
our business depends significantly on effective information systems and the integrity and timeliness of the data we use to run our business 
our business strategy involves providing members and providers with easy to use products that leverage our information to meet their needs 
our ability to adequately price our products and services  provide effective and efficient service to our customers  and to timely and accurately report our financial results depends significantly on the integrity of the data in our information systems 
as a result of our past and on going acquisition activities  we have acquired additional systems 
we have been taking steps to 
table of contents reduce the number of systems we operate  have upgraded and expanded our information systems capabilities  and are gradually migrating existing business to fewer systems 
if the information we rely upon to run our businesses was found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain effectively our information systems and data integrity  we could have operational disruptions  have problems in determining medical cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing  have customer and physician and other health care provider disputes  have regulatory problems  have increases in operating expenses  lose existing customers  have difficulty in attracting new customers  or suffer other adverse consequences 
our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain  protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology  evolving industry and regulatory standards  and changing customer preferences 
we depend on independent third parties for significant portions of our systems related support  equipment  facilities  and certain data  including data center operations  data network  voice communication services and pharmacy data processing 
this dependence makes our operations vulnerable to such third parties failure to perform adequately under the contract  due to internal or external factors 
due to continued consolidation in the industry  there are a limited number of service organizations with the size  scale and capabilities to effectively provide certain of these services  especially with regard to pharmacy benefits processing and management 
however  we believe that other organizations could provide similar services on comparable terms 
a change in service providers  however  could result in a decline in service quality and effectiveness or less favorable contract terms which could adversely affect our operating results 
we rely on our agreements with customers  confidentiality agreements with employees  and our trade secrets and copyrights to protect our proprietary rights 
these legal protections and precautions may not prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information 
in addition  substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in the software industry 
we expect software products to be increasingly subject to third party infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in this area grows 
there can be no assurance that our process of improving existing systems  developing new systems to support our operations  integrating new systems  protecting our proprietary information  and improving service levels will not be delayed or that additional systems issues will not arise in the future 
failure to adequately protect and maintain the integrity of our information systems and data may result in a material adverse effect on our financial positions  results of operations and cash flows 
if we fail to manage prescription drug costs successfully  our financial results could suffer 
in general  prescription drug costs have been rising over the past few years 
these increases are due to the introduction of new drugs costing significantly more than existing drugs  direct to consumer advertising by the pharmaceutical industry that creates consumer demand for particular brand name drugs  and members seeking medications to address lifestyle changes 
in order to control prescription drug costs  we have implemented multi tiered copayment benefit designs for prescription drugs  including our four tiered copayment benefit design  rx and an rx allowance program 
we are also evaluating other multi tiered designs 
we cannot assure that these efforts will be successful in controlling costs 
failure to control these costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
we are involved in various legal actions  which  if resolved unfavorably to us  could result in substantial monetary damages 
we are a party to a variety of legal actions that affect our business  including employment and employment discrimination related suits  employee benefit claims  breach of contract actions  and tort claims 
we  together with some of our competitors in the health benefits business are defendants in a number of purported class action lawsuits 
these include an action against us and nine of our competitors that purports to 
table of contents be brought on behalf of health care providers 
this suit alleges breaches of federal statutes  including erisa and rico 
in addition  because of the nature of the health care business  we are subject to a variety of legal actions relating to our business operations  including the design  management and offering of products and services 
these include and could include in the future claims relating to the methodologies for calculating premiums  claims relating to the denial of health care benefits  challenges to the use of some software products used in administering claims  medical malpractice actions based on our medical necessity decisions or brought against us on the theory that we are liable for our providers alleged malpractice  allegations of anti competitive and unfair business activities  provider disputes over compensation and termination of provider contracts  disputes related to self funded business  including actions alleging claim administration errors  claims related to the failure to disclose some business practices  and claims relating to customer audits and contract performance 
in some cases  substantial non economic or punitive damages as well as treble damages under the federal false claims act  rico and other statutes may be sought 
while we currently have insurance coverage for some of these potential liabilities  other potential liabilities may not be covered by insurance  insurers may dispute coverage or the amount of insurance may not be enough to cover the damages awarded 
additionally  the cost of business insurance coverage has increased significantly 
as a result  we have increased the amount of risk that we self insure  particularly with respect to matters incidental to our business 
we believe that we are adequately insured for claims in excess of our self insurance 
however  some types of damages  like punitive damages  may not be covered by insurance  particularly in those jurisdictions in which coverage of punitive damages is prohibited 
insurance coverage for all or some forms of liability may become unavailable or prohibitively expensive in the future 
a description of material legal actions in which we are currently involved is included under legal proceedings of item in part i 
we cannot predict the outcome of these suits with certainty  and we are incurring expenses in the defense of these matters 
in addition  recent court decisions  including some that erode protections under the employee retirement income security act  or erisa  and legislative activity may increase our exposure for any of these types of claims 
therefore  these legal actions could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
as a government contractor  we are exposed to additional risks that could adversely affect our business or our willingness to participate in government health care programs 
a significant portion of our revenues relates to federal  state and local government health care coverage programs  including the tricare  medicare choice  and medicaid programs 
these programs involve various risks  including the possibility of reduced or insufficient government reimbursement in the future  the possibility that we will not be able to extend or renew any of the contracts relating to these programs 
these contracts also are generally subject to frequent change  including changes that may reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible to enroll  reduce the revenue we receive or increase 
table of contents our administrative or health care costs under those programs 
our current tricare contract with the department of defense will be in effect until april  for regions and and until june  for regions and each of the contracts is subject to a one year renewal at the government s option 
we believe these contracts will continue until the tricare transition described below 
on august   the department of defense notified us that we were awarded the contract for the south region  one of three newly created regions under the government s revised tricare program 
the current tricare regions and will become part of the new south region along with region  which is currently administered by another contractor 
the current regions and will become part of the north region  which was awarded to another contractor 
pursuant to the department of defense s bid process  each of the three awards was subject to protests by unsuccessful bidders of prime contracts  however  none of the protests were successful 
under the department of defense s current schedule for implementation of the new tricare contracts  regions and will transition to the new north region for the start of healthcare delivery on july  regions and will become part of the new south region for the start of healthcare delivery on august  and region will become part of our new south region for the start of healthcare delivery on november  if this schedule is realized  our tricare membership is expected to temporarily decline to million in july  and is expected to increase to million in november this will also result in a decline in revenues during this period 
in the event government reimbursement were to decline from projected amounts  our failure to reduce the health care costs associated with these programs could have a material adverse effect on our business 
changes to these government programs in the future may also affect our ability or willingness to participate in these programs 
other than as described herein  the loss of our current or future tricare contracts  would have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows  at december   under one of our contracts with the centers for medicare and medicaid services  or cms  we provided health insurance coverage to approximately  members in florida 
this contract accounted for approximately of our total premiums and aso fees for the twelve months ended december  the loss of this and other cms contracts or significant changes in the medicareadvantage program as a result of legislative action  including reductions in payments to us or increases in benefits to members without corresponding increases in payments  may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows  in december  the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act  or dima  was signed into law 
dima includes provisions that require the stabilization funding to be directed toward increased reimbursement for providers  increased benefits or access for members or decreased member premiums 
we believe dima will open new opportunities for us 
however  dima may intensify competition in the seniors health services market 
we do not believe that the benefit to our financial position  results of operations or cash flows will be material  higher comparative medical costs  government regulatory and reporting requirements  higher marketing and advertising costs per member as a result of marketing to individuals as opposed to groups  and the possibility of temporary or permanent suspension from participating in government health care programs  including medicare and medicaid  if we are convicted of fraud or other criminal conduct in the performance of a health care program or if there is an adverse decision against us under the federal false claims act 

table of contents our industry is currently subject to substantial government regulation  which  along with possible increased governmental regulation or legislative reform  increases our costs of doing business and could adversely affect our profitability 
the health care industry in general  and health insurance  particularly health maintenance organizations  or hmos  and preferred provider organizations  or ppos  are subject to substantial federal and state government regulation  including regulation relating to minimum net worth  licensing requirements  approval of policy language and benefits  mandated benefits and processes  provider compensation arrangements  member disclosure  approval of acquisitions  approval of entry  withdrawal or re entry into a state or market  premium rates  and periodic examinations by state and federal agencies 
state regulations require our licensed  operating subsidiaries to maintain minimum net worth requirements and restrict some investment activities 
additionally  those regulations restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to make dividend payments  loans  loan repayments or other payments to us 
in recent years  significant federal and state legislation affecting our business has been enacted 
state and federal governmental authorities are continually considering changes to laws and regulations applicable to us and are currently considering regulations relating to mandatory benefits and products  rules tightening time periods in which claims must be paid  medical malpractice reform  defining medical necessity  health insurance access  provider compensation and contract language  disclosure of provider fee schedules and other data impacting payments to providers  product flexibility and use of innovative technology  disclosure of provider quality information  health plan liability to members who fail to receive appropriate care  disclosure and composition of physician networks  formation of regional national association health plans for small employers  physicians ability to collectively negotiate contract terms with carriers  including fees  and mental health parity 
all of these proposals could apply to us 

table of contents there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to obtain or maintain required governmental approvals or licenses or that legislative or regulatory changes will not have a material adverse effect on our business 
delays in obtaining or failure to obtain or maintain required approvals could adversely affect our revenue or the number of our members  increase costs or adversely affect our ability to bring new products to market as forecasted 
the national association of insurance commissioners  or naic  has adopted risk based capital requirements  also known as rbc  which is subject to state by state adoption and to the extent implemented  sets minimum capitalization requirements for insurance and hmo companies 
the naic recommendations for life insurance companies were adopted in all states and the prescribed calculation for hmos has been adopted in most states in which we operate 
the hmo rules may increase the minimum capital required for some of our subsidiaries 
the health insurance portability and accountability act of  or hipaa  includes administrative provisions directed at simplifying electronic data interchange through standardizing transactions  establishing uniform health care provider  payer  and employer identifiers and seeking protections for confidentiality and security of patient data 
under the new hipaa standard transactions and code sets rules  we have made significant systems enhancements and invest in new technological solutions 
the compliance and enforcement date for standard transactions and code sets rules was october  we have continued to be in compliance with this regulation 
however  as many providers indicated that they could not yet comply  cms stated that covered entities making a good faith effort to comply with hipaa transactions and code set standards would be allowed to implement contingency plans to maintain their operations and cash flows 
on october   we announced implementation of a contingency plan to accept non compliant electronic transactions from our providers 
we will continue to accept and process transactions sent in pre hipaa electronic formats from providers who are showing a good faith effort until all providers and clearinghouses are capable of transmitting fully compliant standards transactions as defined in the hipaa implementation guidelines or until cms begins enforcement of the hipaa electronic data interchange regulations 
management believes that the implementation of our contingency plans has minimized any disruptions in our business operations during this transition 
however  if entities with which we do business do not ultimately comply with the hipaa transactions and code set standards  it could result in disruptions of certain of our business operations 
additionally  under the new hipaa privacy rules  which became effective on april   we must now comply with a variety of requirements concerning the use and disclosure of individuals protected health information  establish rigorous internal procedures to protect health information and enter into business associate contracts with those companies to whom protected health information is disclosed 
regulations issued in february set standards for the security of electronic health information requiring compliance by april  violations of these rules will subject us to significant penalties 
compliance with hipaa regulations requires significant systems enhancements  training and administrative effort 
the final rules do not provide for complete federal preemption of state laws  but rather preempt all inconsistent state laws unless the state law is more stringent 
hipaa could also expose us to additional liability for violations by our business associates 
another area receiving increased focus is the time in which various laws require the payment of health care claims 
many states already have legislation in place covering payment of claims within a specific number of days 
however  due to provider groups advocating for laws or regulations establishing even stricter standards  procedures and penalties  we expect additional regulatory scrutiny and supplemental legislation with respect to claims payment practices 
the provider sponsored bills are characterized by stiff penalties for late payment  including high interest rates payable to providers and costly fines levied by state insurance departments and attorneys general 
this legislation and possible future regulation and oversight could expose our company to additional liability and penalties 
we are also subject to various governmental audits and investigations 
these can include audits and investigations by state attorneys general  cms  the office of the inspector general of health and human 
table of contents services  the office of personnel management  the department of justice  the department of labor  and state departments of insurance and departments of health 
these activities could result in the loss of licensure or the right to participate in various programs  or the imposition of fines  penalties and other sanctions 
in addition  disclosure of any adverse investigation or audit results or sanctions could negatively affect our reputation in various markets and make it more difficult for us to sell our products and services 
if we fail to maintain satisfactory relationships with the providers of care to our members  our business could be adversely affected 
we contract with physicians  hospitals and other providers to deliver health care to our members 
our products encourage or require our customers to use these contracted providers 
these providers may share medical cost risk with us or have financial incentives to deliver quality medical services in a cost effective manner 
in any particular market  providers could refuse to contract with us  demand higher payments  or take other actions that could result in higher health care costs for us  less desirable products for customers and members or difficulty meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements 
in some markets  some providers  particularly hospitals  physician hospital organizations or multi specialty physician groups  may have significant market positions and negotiating power 
in addition  physician or practice management companies  which aggregate physician practices for administrative efficiency and marketing leverage  may  in some cases  compete directly with us 
if these providers refuse to contract with us  use their market position to negotiate favorable contracts or place us at a competitive disadvantage  our ability to market products or to be profitable in those areas could be adversely affected 
in some situations  we have contracts with individual or groups of primary care physicians for an actuarially determined  fixed  per member per month fee under which physicians are paid an amount to provide all required medical services to our members ie capitation 
the inability of providers to properly manage costs under these capitation arrangements can result in the financial instability of these providers and the termination of their relationship with us 
in addition  payment or other disputes between a primary care provider and specialists with whom the primary care provider contracts can result in a disruption in the provision of services to our members or a reduction in the services available to our members 
the financial instability or failure of a primary care provider to pay other providers for services rendered could lead those other providers to demand payment from us  even though we have made our regular fixed payments to the primary provider 
there can be no assurance that providers with whom we contract will properly manage the costs of services  maintain financial solvency or avoid disputes with other providers 
any of these events could have an adverse effect on the provision of services to our members and our operations 
our ability to obtain funds from our subsidiaries is restricted 
because we operate as a holding company  we are dependent upon dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from our subsidiaries to fund the obligations of humana inc  the parent company 
these subsidiaries generally are regulated by states departments of insurance 
in most states  we are required to seek prior approval by these state regulatory authorities before we transfer money or pay dividends from these subsidiaries that exceed specified amounts  or  in some states  any amount 
in addition  we normally notify the state departments of insurance prior to making payments that do not require approval 
we are also required by law to maintain specific prescribed minimum amounts of capital in these subsidiaries 
one tricare subsidiary under the regions and contract with the department of defense is required to maintain assets at least equivalent to its current liabilities 

table of contents increased litigation and negative publicity could increase our cost of doing business 
the health benefits industry continues to receive significant negative publicity reflecting the public perception of the industry 
this publicity and perception have been accompanied by increased litigation  including some large jury awards  legislative activity  regulation and governmental review of industry practices 
these factors may adversely affect our ability to market our products or services  may require us to change our products or services  may increase the regulatory burdens under which we operate and may require us to pay large judgments or fines 
any combination of these factors could further increase our cost of doing business and adversely affect our financial position  results of operations and cash flows
