overview we were founded in to commercialize and enhance our proprietary vertical gradient freeze vgf technique for producing high performance compound semiconductor substrates 
upon the discontinuance of our opto electronics division  and the sale of substantially all of the assets of this business in  we now have one operating segment our substrate division 
we made our first substrate sales in and our substrate division currently sells gallium arsenide gaas and indium phosphide inp substrates to manufacturers of semiconductor devices for use in applications such as fiber optic and wireless telecommunications  light emitting diodes leds and lasers 
we also sell raw materials including gallium and germanium through our participation in majority and minority owned joint ventures 
we have the capability to manufacture germanium substrates for use in satellite solar cells but withdrew from this business during so that we could more profitably use our then constrained capacity 
we are now trying to re qualify our germanium substrates with the few existing satellite solar cell system manufacturers 
our total revenue from continuing operations was million for  million for and million for in we incurred a loss from operations of million compared to a loss of million for and income of million for on june   we announced the discontinuation of our opto electronics division  which we established as part of our acquisition of lyte optronics  inc in may accordingly  the results of operations of the opto electronics division have been segregated from continuing operations and are reported separately as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented see note to our consolidated financial statements for details regarding the accounting for discontinued operations 
the discontinued opto electronics division manufactured blue  cyan  and green high brightness light emitting diodes hbleds for the illumination markets  including full color displays  wireless handset backlighting and traffic signals  and also manufactured vertical cavity surface emitting lasers vcsels and laser diodes for fiber optic communications and storage area networks 
on september  we completed a sale of substantially all of the assets of our opto electronics business to lumei optoelectronics  corp 
and dalian luming science and technology group  co  ltd 
for the chinese renminbi rmb equivalent of million 
sale proceeds of million will be held in escrow for up to one year and will not be recorded until all claims  if any  are settled 
if unclaimed  up to  of the sale proceeds will be held in escrow for a second year and will not be recorded until all claims  if any  are settled 
we retain a building located in monterey park  ca  that we expect to sell in this asset is classified as held for sale on our consolidated balance sheet at december  
table of contents our continuing business  primarily sales of our substrate products  is dependant on the semiconductor industry  which is highly cyclical and has historically experienced downturns both as a result of economic changes and of overcapacity 
we experienced a growth period that lasted from our initiation of sales in through the first half of in the second half of  we experienced a million  or decrease in revenue compared to the first half as a result of the rapid decline in the mobile and fiber optic telecommunications markets 
together with other industry participants  we experienced lower revenues  slower bookings  push outs and cancellation of orders 
as such  we recorded losses in the third and fourth quarters of during the first half of our revenues grew due to improvements in the wireless market 
in the second half of our revenue fell  however  because the substrate industry was still facing excess capacity that caused prices to decline  and because we experienced a loss of market share after two competitors developed technologies similar to ours 
in addition  certain customers selected competitors products in order to diversify their supply sources and due to the belief that the competitors substrates offered better surface qualities 
full year revenue declined million  or compared to we recorded losses in each quarter of and incurred impairment charges against fixed assets and inventory due to the decline in demand and prices 
in reaction to the economic downturn  we initiated an aggressive effort to reduce substrate manufacturing costs 
this included moving much of our substrate manufacturing operations to china  reducing capacity in our fremont  ca facility and developing and investing in key low cost raw material sources 
in  we believe that the wireless communications and hbled markets grew  but our revenue did not increase until the fourth quarter of due to continued reductions in prices and the time required to improve our substrate surface quality and regain some lost customers 
revenue for fell by million  or compared with we recorded losses in each quarter of during the year we continued to shift more of our manufacturing operations to china and reduced our costs incurred in the united states 
we cannot predict the level of future industry demand or of our ability to regain lost market share  but they have impacted our ability to sell our products and operate profitably 
if demand for our products remains depressed for an extended period  our business will be harmed as a result 
our business performance will be most influenced by market demand for compound semi conductor substrates  our ability to offer products that equal or exceed the quality provided by competitors  product pricing  our ability to shift more of our manufacturing production to china  and our ability to create and defend our intellectual property while not infringing on the intellectual property of others 
critical accounting policies and estimates we have prepared our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
as such  we have had to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported on our financial statements 
these estimates  assumptions and judgments about future events and their effects on our results cannot be determined with certainty  and are made based upon our historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates may change as new events occur or additional information is obtained  and we may periodically be faced with uncertainties  the outcomes of which are not within our control and may not be known for a prolonged period of time 
the discussion and analysis of our results of operations and financial condition are based upon these consolidated financial statements 
we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and understanding of our financial condition and results of operations 
a critical accounting policy is one that is both material to the presentation of our financial statements and requires us to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
they may require us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate  and different estimates that we could have used  or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur  may have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 

table of contents we believe that the following are our critical accounting policies revenue recognition we recognize revenue upon shipment of products to our customers provided that we have received a signed purchase order  the price is fixed or determinable  title has transferred  collection of resulting receivables is probable  product returns are reasonably estimable  there are no customer acceptance requirements and there are no remaining obligations 
we assess the probability of collection based on a number of factors including past history with the customer and credit worthiness 
we provide for future returns based on historical experience  current economic trends and changes in customer demand at the time revenue is recognized 
except for sales in japan and some sales in taiwan  which in both cases are denominated in japanese yen  we denominate and collect our international sales in us dollars 
we do not provide for warranty related exposure as such exposure has historically been immaterial 
allowance for doubtful accounts we periodically review the likelihood of collecting our accounts receivable balances and provide an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable primarily based upon the age of these accounts 
we provide a allowance for us receivables in excess of days and for foreign receivables in excess of days 
at december  our accounts receivable balance was million net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of million 
inventory inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using the standard cost method 
finished goods and work in process inventories include material  labor and manufacturing overhead costs 
we routinely evaluate the levels of our inventory in light of current market conditions in order to identify excess and obsolete inventory and we provide a valuation allowance for certain inventories based upon the age and quality of the product 
competitive delivery times are frequently less than the time required for us to manufacture a product  requiring us to build some work in process inventories in anticipation of orders 
if orders are not obtained for the product built  the products will ultimately be deemed obsolete and we will establish a reserve for their value 
we also review our inventory to ensure costs can be realized upon ultimate sale to our customers 
if we determine that the value of any items in ending inventory exceeds the sales value less any related selling costs  a reserve is established for the difference 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate the recoverability of property  equipment  and intangible assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 or sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
when events and circumstances indicate that long lived assets may be impaired  we compare the carrying value of the long lived assets to the projection of future undiscounted cash flows attributable to such assets and in the event that the carrying value exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows  we record an impairment charge against income equal to the excess of the carrying value over the asset s fair value 
investments we determine the appropriate classification of investments at the time of purchase 
available for sale investments are carried at their fair value based on quoted market prices as of the balance sheet date 
the amortized cost of securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity 
such amortization is included in other income and expense  net 
realized gains or losses are determined on the specific identification method and are reflected in other income and expense  net 
net unrealized gains or losses are recorded directly in stockholders equity 
those unrealized losses that are deemed to be other than temporary are reflected in interest and other income  net 
we also maintain minority investments in private companies which are accounted for under the cost basis 
these investments are reviewed for other 
table of contents than temporary declines in value on a quarterly basis 
reasons for other than temporary declines in value include whether the related company would have insufficient cash flow to operate for the next twelve months  significant changes in the operating performance and changes in market conditions 
income taxes we account for deferred income taxes using the liability method  under which the expected future tax consequences of timing differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities are recognized as deferred tax assets and liabilities 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce net deferred tax assets when management estimates  based on available objective evidence  that it is more likely than not that the future income tax benefit represented by the net deferred tax asset will not be realized 
voluntary stock option exchange program on may   we announced a voluntary stock option exchange program for our employees 
under the program  our option holders  excluding our executive officers and independent directors  had the opportunity to cancel outstanding options with an exercise price in excess of per share in exchange for new options to be granted at a future date that was at least six months and one day after the cancellation date 
the number of shares of common stock subject to the new options was equal to of the number subject to the exchanged options 
under the exchange program  options to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock  representing approximately of the options that were eligible to be tendered in the offer were tendered and cancelled 
new options will vest at the same rate as the exchanged options and have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our common stock at the new grant date  which was per share 
on december   we granted options to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock in exchange for such tendered options 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth certain operating data as a percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated 
years ended december  revenue cost of revenue gross profit loss operating expenses selling  general  and administrative research and development restructuring costs total operating expenses income loss from operations interest expense other income and expense  net income loss from continuing operations before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes income loss from continuing operations discontinued operations loss from discontinued operations loss on disposal benefit for income taxes loss from discontinued operations net loss year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue from continuing operations 
revenue from continuing operations decreased million  or  to million in compared to million in total gaas substrate revenue decreased million  or  to million in compared to million in sales of inch and inch diameter gaas substrates  which are used exclusively to manufacture electronic devices  decreased million  or  to million in compared to million in inp substrate revenue decreased million  or  to million in compared to million in inp substrates are used almost exclusively for telecommunications applications 
the decrease in gaas and inp substrate revenue is due to decreased volume and lower average sales prices as a result of the slowdown in our target markets including telecommunications  high speed electronic devices  and short wavelength lasers  and the introduction of vgf like substrates from our competitors that caused some customers to purchase substrates from our competitors rather than from us 
international revenue increased to of total revenue from continuing operations in compared to in the increase was primarily due to a greater share of our gaas substrates being used in opto electronics applications and the majority of our customers for these applications being in asia 
gross margin 
gross margin increased to of revenue in compared to negative in the increase was primarily due to reduced costs associated with moving most of our production to china 
in addition  we incurred a charge of million in related to the write down of certain inventory that we concluded was obsolete 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  to million in compared to million in as a percentage of total revenue  selling  general and administrative expenses were in compared to in the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses is the result of our efforts to adjust costs in line with our current business and of our ability to shift some of these activities to china where our costs are lower 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses decreased million or  to million in compared to million in as a percentage of total revenue  research and development expenses were in compared to in although we reduced research and development expenses in as part of our effort to reduce costs  we believe that continued investment in product development is critical to attaining our strategic objectives of maintaining and increasing our technology leadership  and as a result  we expect research and development expenses to remain at current levels in future periods 
research and development efforts during were focused primarily on improving the yield and surface quality of our gaas substrates 
interest expense 
interest expense increased  or  to  in compared to  in by the end of  we had repaid million in equipment lease and loan debt which will reduce future interest payments 
other income and expense  net 
other expense was million in compared to million in the amount in includes charges of million related to the write down of investments we hold in two privately held us companies 
the amount in includes non cash charges of million related to the write down to market value of our investment in finisar corporation common stock and million to write down a building held for sale to net realizable value 
provision for income taxes 
due to our continuing operating losses and uncertainty regarding future profitability  we recorded a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets of million in during  we continued to record a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets and as a result  our effective tax rate decreased to for loss from discontinued operations 
loss from our discontinued opto electronics division for the year ended december  was million  which included a loss on disposal of million and the operating loss from our discontinued opto electronics division of million 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue from continuing operations 
revenue from continuing operations decreased million  or  to million in compared to million in total gaas substrate revenue decreased million  or  to million in compared to million in sales of and diameter gaas substrates decreased million  or  to million in compared to million in inp substrate revenue decreased million  or  to million in compared to million in the decrease in gaas and inp substrate revenue was due to decreased volume and sales prices as a result of the slowdown in our markets including telecommunications  high speed electronic devices  and short wavelength lasers 
international revenue decreased to of total revenue in compared to of total revenue in gross margin 
gross margin decreased to negative of revenue in compared to positive in the decrease was primarily due to lower unit sales and average sales prices of gaas and inp substrates spread over a relatively fixed manufacturing overhead base and a million charge to write down excess inventory 
as a result  we initiated manufacturing cost reductions in order to align our costs with lower expected sales volumes and prices 
we shifted much of our substrate manufacturing to china and reduced capacity in our fremont  california facility 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  to million in compared to million in as a percentage of total 
table of contents revenue  selling  general and administrative expenses were in compared to in in order to align our cost structure with the rapid decline in revenues  we initiated and aggressively pursued cost reductions in this area  which led to the decrease in research and development expenses 
research and development expenses decreased million or  to million in compared to million in as a percentage of total revenue  research and development expenses were in compared to in research and development efforts during were focused primarily on improving the yield and surface quality of our gaas substrates 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased  or  to  in compared to  in the decrease was primarily due to the repayment of certain long term real estate notes and capital equipment leases 
other income and expense 
other expense was million in compared to million in the amount in includes non cash charges of million related to the write down to market value of our investment in finisar corporation common stock and million to write down a building held for sale to net realizable value 
the balance includes a non cash charge of million to write down to market value our investment in finisar common stock 
provision for income taxes 
due to our continuing operating losses during and uncertainty regarding future profitability  we recorded a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets of million in as a result  our effective tax rate decreased to in our effective tax rate in was 
loss from discontinued operations 
loss from our discontinued opto electronics division for the year ended december  was million net of income tax benefit of million 
liquidity and capital resources we consider cash and cash equivalents  and short term investments as liquid and available for use 
short term investments are comprised of government bonds and high grade commercial debt instruments 
also included in short term investments is our common stock investment in finisar corporation 
cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and long term investments  excluding million and million for our investment in finisar common stock at december  and respectively  increased million to million at december  compared to million at december  cash and cash equivalents increased million to million at december  compared to million at december  net cash provided by operating activities of million for the year ended december  was comprised primarily of our net loss adjusted for non cash items of million  consisting primarily of the loss on disposal of our opto electronics division of million  depreciation of million  and by a million net change in assets and liabilities 
the net change in assets and liabilities resulted primarily from a decrease in inventory  prepaid expenses and income tax receivable  offset by decreases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
accounts receivable decreased  or  to million at december  compared to million at december  the change reflects lower sales volume  collections of million and a decrease in our allowance for doubtful accounts of million due to the collection of previously written down receivables 
it also included a  write down of accounts receivable from our discontinued opto electronics division  which is included in loss on disposal in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  inventories decreased million  or to million at december  compared to million at december  the decrease in inventory included a million write down of inventory from our discontinued opto electronics division  which is included in loss on disposal in our consolidated 
table of contents statement of operations for the year ended december  the company adopted a strategy of using inventory to conserve cash 
during we do not expect to maintain the same rate of net inventory decrease as we experienced in net cash provided by investing activities of million for the year ended december  includes proceeds from the sale of property and equipment  and high grade investment securities totaling million  offset by purchases of property and equipment of million primarily used to transfer production capacity to china for the substrate division  and purchases of high grade investment securities with maturities of less than two years totaling million 
it also includes an increase in restricted cash of million to collateralize a letter of credit with a bank that supports our long term debt and workers compensation insurance policy 
we do not have any plans to initiate any major new capital spending projects through we are currently completing certain projects at our china facilities and are continuously constructing minor improvements to our existing production facilities in china and california 
we expect to invest approximately million in capital projects in we believe that our existing and planned facilities and equipment are sufficient to fulfill current and expected future orders 
net cash used in financing activities of million consisted of proceeds of  from the exercise of options by our employees  offset by payments of million to reduce long term borrowings and capital leases 
our main fremont  california manufacturing facility is financed by long term borrowings  which were refinanced by taxable variable rate revenue bonds in these bonds mature in and bear interest at a variable rate that was at december  the bonds are traded in the public market 
repayment of principal and interest under the bonds is supported by a letter of credit from our bank and is paid on a quarterly basis 
we have the option to redeem the bonds in whole or in part during their term 
at december   million was outstanding under these bonds 
at december  the credit facility maintained by us with a bank included a letter of credit supporting repayment of our industrial bonds with an outstanding amount of million 
the company has pledged and placed cash and certain investment securities with an affiliate of the bank as additional collateral for this facility 
we have also pledged cash for a credit facility for our workers compensation insurance 
as a result  million of our cash and long term investments are restricted 
we currently hold a note payable secured by certain equipment in china totaling million at december  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
the balance on this note will be due in december we believe that we have adequate cash and investments to meet the company s short and long term needs 
if our sales decrease  however  our ability to generate cash from operations will be adversely affected which could adversely affect our future liquidity  require us to use more cash at a more rapid rate than expected  and require us to seek additional capital 
there can be no assurance that such additional capital will be available or  if available it will be at terms acceptable to the company 
cash from operations could be affected by various risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to those set forth below under risks related to our business 

table of contents outstanding contractual obligations as of december  are summarized below in thousands operating debt leases total thereafter we lease certain office space  manufacturing facilities and property under long term operating leases expiring at various dates through march total rent expense under these operating leases was approximately million for the year ended december    in and  in risks related to our business the semiconductor industry is cyclical and has experienced a downturn which has adversely impacted our operating results 
our continuing business depends in significant part upon manufacturers of electronic and opto electronic semiconductor devices  as well as the current and anticipated market demand for such devices and products using such devices 
as a supplier to the semiconductor industry  we are subject to the business cycles that characterize the industry 
the timing  length and volatility of these cycles are difficult to predict 
the semiconductor industry has historically been cyclical because of sudden changes in demand for semiconductors and capacity requirements  including capacity utilizing the latest technology 
the rate of changes in demand  including end demand  is high  and the effect of these changes upon us occurs quickly  exacerbating the volatility of these cycles 
these changes have affected the timing and amounts of customers capital equipment purchases and investments in new technology 
these industry cycles create pressure on our net sales  gross margin and net income 
the industry has previously experienced periods of oversupply that result in significantly reduced demand for semiconductor devices and components  including our products  both as a result of general economic changes and overcapacity 
when these periods occur  our operating results and financial condition are adversely affected  and create pressure on our revenue  gross margins and net income 
inventory buildups in telecommunications products and slower than expected sales of computer equipment resulted in overcapacity and led to reduced sales by our customers  and therefore reduced purchases of our products 
during periods of weak demand such as those experienced over the past years  customers typically reduce purchases  delay delivery of products and or cancel orders of component parts such as our products 
increased price competition has resulted  causing pressure on our net sales  gross margin and net income 
we experienced cancellations  price reductions  delays and push outs of orders  which have resulted in reduced revenues 
if the economic downturn were to continue  or occur again in the future  further order cancellations  reductions in order size or delays in orders will materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 
actions to reduce our costs  such as those we have recently taken  may be insufficient to align our structure with prevailing business conditions 
we may be required to undertake additional cost cutting measures  and may be unable to invest in marketing  research and development and engineering at the levels we believe are necessary to maintain our competitive position 
our failure to make these investments could seriously harm our business 
during periods of increasing demand for semiconductor devices  we must have sufficient manufacturing capacity and inventory to meet customer demand  and must be able to attract  hire  train and retain qualified employees to meet demand 
it appears that the semiconductor industry is in the early stages of an upturn and increasing demand 
however  we cannot predict the sustainability of a recovery  if any  and the industry s rate of growth in this recovery  if it occurs 
if we are unable to effectively manage our resources and production 
table of contents capacity during an industry upturn  there could be a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if the economy recovers and we are again in a period of high demand for our products  we may be unable to expand our manufacturing capacity quickly enough to meet increased demand  we may make decisions to expand capacity that are not profitable  and we may be unable to lower our costs or increase revenue 
it appears that the industry may be in an upturn  which may cause demand to increase rapidly as it has in prior years after other cyclical downturns in the economy and the industries in which we operate 
if this happens  in order to meet increased demand and maintain our market share  we may need to increase production  which could require us to build new facilities  expand and modify our existing facilities  purchase additional manufacturing equipment  and add qualified staff 
if we are not at that time able to expand our manufacturing capacity  we will be unable to increase production  which may adversely impact our ability to meet increased production demand while reducing unit costs  margins and improving our operating results 
we are currently constructing and modifying facilities in california and china 
our construction activities subject us to a number of risks  including unforeseen environmental or engineering problems  unavailability or late delivery of production equipment  delays in completing new facilities  delays in bringing production equipment on line  work stoppages or delays  inability to recruit and train qualified staff  and unanticipated cost increases and restrictions imposed by requirements of local  state or federal regulatory agencies in the united states and china 
if any of these risks occurs  construction may be costlier than anticipated and completion could be delayed  which could hurt our ability to expand capacity and increase our sales 
in addition  if we experience delays in expanding our manufacturing capacity  we may not be able to timely meet customer requirements  and we could lose future sales 
we are also completing selective investments in equipment and facilities as part of our previously planned capacity expansion 
to offset the additional fixed operating expenses  we must increase our revenue by increasing production and improving yields 
if demand for our products does not grow  if prices decline significantly  or if our yields do not improve as anticipated  we may be unable to offset these costs against increased revenue  which would adversely impact our operating results 
unpredictable fluctuations in our operating results could disappoint analysts or our investors  which could cause our stock price to decline 
we have not over the past year been able to sustain growth  and may not be able to return to historic growth levels in the current economic environment 
our net loss in was the largest in our history and our losses continued during we believe we will endure losses for at least part of we have and may continue to experience significant fluctuations in our revenue and earnings 
our quarterly and annual revenue and operating results have varied significantly in the past and may vary significantly in the future due to a number of factors  including decline in general economic conditions or downturns in the industry in which we compete  fluctuations in demand for our products  expansion of our manufacturing capacity  expansion of our operations in china  
table of contents limited availability and increased cost of raw materials  the volume and timing of orders from our customers  and cancellations  push outs and delays of customer orders  fluctuation of our manufacturing yields  decreases in the prices of our competitors products  costs incurred in connection with any future acquisitions of businesses or technologies  increases in our expenses  including expenses for research and development  and our ability to develop  manufacture and deliver high quality products in a timely and cost effective manner 
due to these factors  we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful indicators of our future performance 
our operating results have over the past year at times been below the expectations of securities analysts or investors 
if this occurs again in future periods  the price of our common stock could decline or fluctuate 
a substantial percentage of our operating expenses are fixed in the short term and we may be unable to adjust spending to compensate for an unexpected shortfall in revenues 
as a result  any delay in generating revenue could cause our operating results to be below the expectations of market analysts or investors  which could also cause our stock price to fall 
our results of operations may suffer if we do not effectively manage our inventory 
we must manage our inventory of component parts  work in process  and finished goods effectively to meet changing customer requirements  while keeping inventory costs down and improving gross margins 
some of our products and supplies have in the past and may in the future become obsolete while in inventory due to changing customer specifications  or become excess inventory due to decreased demand for our products and an inability to sell the inventory within a foreseeable period 
furthermore  if current costs of production increase or sales prices drop below the standard prices at which we value inventory  we may need to take a charge for a reduction in inventory values 
we have in the past had to take inventory valuation and impairment charges 
if we are not successfully able to manage our inventory  we may need to write off unsaleable  obsolete or excess inventory  which could adversely affect our results of operations 
on october   we implemented a new inventory control system that may experience unexpected difficulties 
the disposal of our opto electronics business may fail to result in the benefits we anticipate 
we may not obtain the benefits we expect as a result of discontinuation of our opto electronics business  such as greater strategic focus on our core businesses 
we may be required to return to the buyer some or all of the million of the sale proceeds which will be held in escrow should the buyer successfully claim that we breached one of the representations or warranties made to it 
our building in monterey park may not be sold for the million at which we are carrying it on our balance sheet 
we may incur additional costs associated with the discontinued operations which could materially reduce our short term earnings 
much of our cash resources are denominated in chinese currency and are subject to exchange control restrictions 
much of our cash resources are denominated in chinese renminbi and held in accounts in china and  under some circumstances  may not be easily exchanged for us dollars 
the value of our chinese cash holdings are also subject to changes in the exchange rate between chinese renminbi and us dollars 
if our us dollar commitments were to exceed the cash we have available in the united states  we may be unable to access cash held in china to satisfy these commitments 

table of contents a reoccurrence of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars or the outbreak of a different contagious disease may adversely impact our manufacturing operations and some of our key suppliers and customers 
the majority of our substrate manufacturing activities are conducted in china 
in addition  we source key raw materials  including gallium  from our joint ventures and other suppliers in china 
the sars outbreak was most notable in china and a small number of cases have been reported to date in one employee at our led production facility in china contracted sars in late april prompting us to close the facility for ten days 
there was no significant impact to our ability to fill customer orders 
if there were to be another outbreak of sars or a different contagious disease and if our employees contracted the disease  we may be required to temporarily close our manufacturing operations 
similarly  if one of our key suppliers is required to close for an extended period  we may not have enough raw material inventory to continue manufacturing operations 
in addition  while we possess management skills among our china staff that enable us to maintain our manufacturing operations with minimal on site supervision from our us based staff  our business could also be harmed if travel to or from asia and the united states is restricted or inadvisable  as it was during parts of none of our substrate competitors is as dependent on manufacturing facilities in china as we are 
if our manufacturing operations were closed for a significant period  we could lose revenue and market share during that period which would depress our financial performance and could be difficult to recapture 
finally  if one of our key customers is required to close for an extended period  we may not be able to ship product to them  our revenue would decline and our financial performance would suffer 
the impact of changes in global economic conditions on our customers may cause us to fail to meet expectations  which would negatively impact the price of our stock 
our operating results can vary significantly based upon the impact of changes in global economic conditions on our customers 
more specifically  the macro economic environment that we faced in was more uncertain than in some prior periods  lasted longer than expected and has materially and adversely affected us and our operating results and may continue to do so 
the revenue growth and profitability of our business depends on the overall demand for our substrates  and we are particularly dependant on the market conditions for the wireless  solid state illumination  fiber optics and telecommunications industries 
because our sales are primarily to major corporate customers whose businesses fluctuate with general economic and business conditions  a softening of demand for products that use our substrates  caused by a weakening economy may result in further or prolonged decreased revenues 
customers may find themselves facing excess inventory from earlier purchases  and may defer or reconsider purchasing products due to the downturn in their business and in the general economy 
if we do not successfully develop new products to respond to rapidly changing customer requirements  our ability to generate sales and obtain new customers may suffer 
our success depends on our ability to offer new products and product features that incorporate leading technology and respond to technological advances 
in addition  our new products must meet customer needs and compete effectively on quality  price and performance 
the life cycles of our products are difficult to predict because the markets for our products are characterized by rapid technological change  changing customer needs and evolving industry standards 
if our competitors introduce products employing new technologies or performance characteristics  our existing products could become obsolete and unmarketable 
during the past year  we have seen our competitors selling more substrates manufactured using a crystal growth technology similar to ours  which has eroded our technological differentiation 
if we fail to offer new products  we may not generate sufficient revenue to offset our development costs and other expenses or meet our customers requirements 
other companies  including triquent  are actively developing substrate materials that could be used to manufacture devices that could provide the same high performance  low power capabilities as gaas and inp based devices at competitive prices 
if these substrate materials or vgf derived products are successfully developed and semiconductor device manufacturers adopt them  demand for our gaas substrates could decline and our revenue could suffer 

table of contents the development of new products can be a highly complex process  and we may experience delays in developing and introducing new products 
any significant delays could cause us to fail to timely introduce and gain market acceptance of new products 
further  the costs involved in researching  developing and engineering new products could be greater than anticipated 
our operating results depend in large part on further customer acceptance of our existing substrate products manufactured in china 
to shift more of our substrate manufacturing operations to china successfully  we will need our customers to qualify products manufactured in china 
if we are unable to achieve qualifications for these products  our china facility will be underutilized  our investments in china will not be recouped and we will be unable to lower our costs by moving to china 
we may lose sales of our products to competitors who are not manufacturing in china  or whose operations in china have already been qualified by customers 
all of these events could reduce our revenue but increase our cost structure 
furthermore  some customers have reduced their orders from us until our surface quality is as good and consistent as that offered by competitors 
as a result  some customers are now allocating their requirements for vgf grown substrates across more competitors and we believe that we have lost revenue and market share as a result of these customer decisions  which we may be unable to recover 
if we are unable to retain our market share  our revenue and performance will decline 
intense competition in the markets for our products could prevent us from increasing revenue and sustaining profitability 
the markets for our products are intensely competitive 
we face competition for our substrate products from other manufacturers of substrates  such as freiberger  hitachi cable  japan energy and sumitomo electric and from semiconductor device manufacturers that produce substrates for their own use  and from companies  such as triquent  that are actively developing alternative materials to gaas and some semiconductor devices are being marketed using these materials 
we believe that at least two of our competitors are shipping high volumes of gaas substrates manufactured using a technique similar to our vgf technique 
other competitors may develop and begin using similar technology 
if we are unable to compete effectively  our revenue may not increase and we may be unable to be profitable 
we face many competitors that have a number of significant advantages over us  including greater experience in the business  more manufacturing experience  extensive intellectual property  broader name recognition  and significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources 
our competitors could develop new or enhanced products that are more effective than our products are 
the level and intensity of competition has increased over the past year and we expect competition to continue to increase in the future 
competitive pressures caused by the current economic conditions have resulted in reductions in the prices of our products  and continued or increased competition could reduce our market share  require us to further reduce the prices of our products  affect our ability to recover costs or result in reduced gross margins 
defects in our products could diminish demand for our products 
our products are complex and may contain defects 
we have experienced quality control problems with some of our products over the past two years  which caused customers to return products to us  reduce orders for our products  or both 
if we continue to experience quality control problems  or experience these or other problems in new products  customers may cancel or reduce orders or purchase products from our competitors 
table of contents and sales of our products could decline 
defects in our products could cause us to incur higher manufacturing costs and suffer product returns and additional service expenses  all of which could adversely impact our operating results 
if new products developed by us contain defects when released  our customers may be dissatisfied and we may suffer negative publicity or customer claims against us  lose sales or experience delays in market acceptance of our new products 
if we have low product yields  the shipment of our products may be delayed and our operating results may be adversely impacted 
our products are manufactured using complex technologies  and the number of usable substrates we can produce can fluctuate as a result of many factors  including impurities in the materials used  contamination of the manufacturing environment  substrate breakage  equipment failure  power outages or variations in the manufacturing process  and performance of personnel involved in the manufacturing process 
if our yields decrease  our revenue could decline because many of our manufacturing costs are fixed  or would increase 
we have experienced product shipment delays and difficulties in achieving acceptable yields on both new and older products  and delays and poor yields have adversely affected our operating results 
we may experience similar problems in the future and we cannot predict when they may occur or their severity 
in particular  many of our manufacturing processes are new and are still being refined  which can result in lower yields 
we derive a significant portion of our revenue from international sales  and our ability to sustain and increase our international sales involves significant risks 
our revenue growth depends in part on the expansion of our international sales and operations 
international sales represented of our total revenue for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  we expect that sales to customers outside the us will continue to represent a significant portion of our revenue  particularly sales to customers in asia 
currently  an increasing percentage of our sales are to customers headquartered in asia 
certain manufacturing facilities and suppliers are also located outside the us managing our global operations presents challenges  including periodic regional economic downturns  trade balance issues  varying business conditions and demands  political instability  variations in enforcement of intellectual property and contract rights in different jurisdictions  differences in the ability to develop relationships with suppliers and other local businesses  changes in us and international laws and regulations including us export restrictions  fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates  the ability to provide sufficient levels of technical support in different locations  cultural differences  shipping delays and terrorist acts or acts of war  among other risks 
many of these challenges are present in china  which represents a large potential market for semiconductor equipment and where axt anticipates significant opportunity for growth 
global uncertainties with respect to i economic growth rates in various countries  ii sustainability of demand for electronics products  iii capital spending by semiconductor manufacturers  iv price weakness for certain semiconductor devices  and v political instability in regions where we have operations may also affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our dependence on international sales involves a number of risks  including changes in tariffs  import or export restrictions and other trade barriers  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  
table of contents longer periods to collect accounts receivable  changes in export license requirements  political and economic instability  unexpected changes in diplomatic and trade relationships  and foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
our sales are denominated in us dollars  except for sales to our japanese and some taiwanese customers  which are denominated in japanese yen 
thus  increases in the value of the us dollar could increase the price of our products in non us markets and make our products more expensive than competitors products in these markets 
also  denominating some sales in japanese yen subjects us to fluctuations in the exchange rates between the us dollar and the japanese yen 
the functional currencies of our japanese and chinese subsidiaries are the local currencies 
we incur transaction gains or losses resulting from consolidation of expenses incurred in local currencies for these subsidiaries  as well as in translation of the assets and liabilities of these assets at each balance sheet date 
if we do not effectively manage the risks associated with international sales  our revenue  cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected 
demand for our products may decrease if our customers experience difficulty manufacturing  marketing or selling their products 
our products are used as components in our customers products 
accordingly  demand for our products is subject to factors affecting the ability of our customers to successfully introduce and market their products  including the competition our customers face in their particular industries  the technical  manufacturing  sales and marketing and management capabilities of our customers  the financial and other resources of our customers  and the inability of our customers to sell their products if they infringe third party intellectual property rights 
if demand for the end user applications for which our products are used decreases  or our customers are unable to develop  market and sell their products  demand for our products will decrease 
the financial condition of our customers may affect their ability to pay amounts owed to us 
many of our customers are facing business downturns that have reduced their cash balances and their prospects 
we frequently allow our customers to pay for products we ship to them within to days after delivery 
subsequent to our shipping a product  some customers have been unable to make payments as due  reducing our cash balances and causing us to incur charges to allow for a possibility that some accounts might not be paid 
at least three customers that owed us a significant amount have filed for bankruptcy protection and we are unlikely to receive a substantial portion or any of the amounts owed to us as part of a bankruptcy settlement 
other customers may also be forced to file for bankruptcy 
if our customers do not pay their accounts when due  we will be required to incur charges that would reduce our earnings 
we purchase critical raw materials and parts for our equipment from single or limited sources  and could lose sales if these sources fail to fill our needs 
we depend on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials  components and equipment used in manufacturing our products  including key materials such as quartz tubing  polishing solutions  and paralytic boron nitride 
we generally purchase these materials through standard purchase orders and not pursuant to long term supply contracts and no supplier guarantees supply of raw materials or equipment to us 
if we lose any of our key suppliers  our manufacturing efforts could be significantly hampered and we could be prevented from timely producing and delivering products to our customers 
we have experienced delays 
table of contents obtaining critical raw materials and spare parts  including gallium  due to shortages of these materials 
we may experience delays due to shortages of materials and may be unable to obtain an adequate supply of materials 
these shortages and delays could result in higher materials costs and cause us to delay or reduce production of our products 
if we have to delay or reduce production  we could fail to meet customer delivery schedules and our revenue and operating results could suffer 
if we fail to comply with environmental and safety regulations  we may be subject to significant fines or cessation of our operations  in addition  we could be subject to suits for personal injuries caused by exposure to hazardous materials 
we are subject to federal  state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations in all of our operating locations 
these laws  rules and regulations govern the use  storage  discharge and disposal of hazardous chemicals during manufacturing  research and development  and sales demonstrations 
if we fail to comply with applicable regulations  we could be subject to substantial liability for clean up efforts  personal injury and fines or suspension or cessation of our operations 
in march  we settled a claim made by the california occupational safety and health administration  or cal osha  in an investigation primarily regarding impermissible levels of potentially hazardous materials in certain areas of our manufacturing facility in fremont  california for  although we have put in place engineering  administrative and personnel protective equipment programs to address these issues  our ability to expand or continue to operate our present locations could be restricted or we could be required to acquire costly remediation equipment or incur other significant expenses 
existing or future changes in laws or regulations may require us to incur significant expenditures or liabilities  or may restrict our operations 
in addition  our employees could be exposed to chemicals or other hazardous materials at our facilities and we may be subject to lawsuits seeking damages for wrongful death or personal injuries allegedly caused by exposure to chemicals or hazardous materials at our facilities 
if litigation is brought against us  litigation is inherently uncertain and while we would expect to defend ourself vigorously  it is possible that our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows  could be affected in any particular period by such litigation if brought against us 
the loss of one or more of our key substrate customers would significantly hurt our operating results 
a small number of substrate customers have historically accounted for a substantial portion of our total revenue 
five customers accounted for of our total revenue for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  one customer accounted for of our revenue for the year ended december  we expect that a significant portion of our future revenue will continue to be derived from a limited number of substrate customers 
our customers are not obligated to purchase a specified quantity of our products or to provide us with binding forecasts of product purchases 
in addition  our customers may reduce  delay or cancel orders at any time without any significant penalty  and during the past year  we have experienced slower bookings  significant push outs and cancellation of orders 
in addition  due to the difficult economic environment  several of our previously large customers have stopped operations entirely 
if we lose a major customer or if a customer cancels  reduces or delays orders  our revenue would decline 
in addition  customers that have accounted for significant revenue in the past may not continue to generate revenue for us in any future period 
any delay in scheduled shipments of our products could cause net sales to fall below our expectations and the expectations of market analysts or investors  causing our stock price to decline 
our substrate products have a long qualification cycle that makes it difficult to plan our expenses and forecast our results 
customers typically place orders with us for our substrate products three months to a year or more after our initial contact with them 
the sale of our products may be subject to delays due to our customers lengthy internal budgeting  approval and evaluation processes 
during this time  we may incur substantial expenses and expend sales  marketing and management efforts while the customers evaluate our products 
these expenditures may not result in sales of our products 
if we do not achieve anticipated sales in a period as 
table of contents expected  we may experience an unplanned shortfall in our revenue 
as a result  we may not be able to cover expenses  causing our operating results to vary 
in addition  if a customer decides not to incorporate our products into its initial design  we may not have another opportunity to sell products to this customer for many months or even years 
in the current competitive and economic climate  the average sales cycle for our products has lengthened even further and is expected to continue to make it difficult to accurately forecast our future sales 
we anticipate that sales of any future substrate products will also have lengthy sales cycles and will  therefore  be subject to risks substantially similar to those inherent in the lengthy sales cycle of our current substrate products 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property  we may lose valuable assets or incur costly litigation 
we rely on a combination of patents  copyrights  trademark and trade secret laws  non disclosure agreements and other intellectual property protection methods to protect our proprietary technology 
however  we believe that  due to the rapid pace of technological innovation in the markets for our products  our ability to establish and maintain a position of technology leadership also depends on the skills of our development personnel 
despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property  a third party could develop products or processes similar to ours 
our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate and our competitors may independently develop similar technology  duplicate our products or design around our patents 
we believe that at least two of our competitors have begun to ship gaas substrates produced using a process similar to our vgf technique 
our competitors may also develop and patent improvements to the vgf technology upon which we rely  and thus may limit any exclusivity we enjoy by virtue of our patents or trade secrets 
it is possible that pending or future united states or foreign patent applications made by us will not be approved  that our issued patents will not protect our intellectual property  or that third parties will challenge the ownership rights or the validity of our patents 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the united states and it may be more difficult to monitor the use of our intellectual property 
our competitors may be able to legitimately ascertain non patented proprietary technology embedded in our systems 
if this occurs  we may not be able to prevent the development of technology substantially similar to ours 
we may have to resort to costly litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets or know how or to determine their scope  validity or enforceability 
enforcing or defending our proprietary technology is expensive  could cause us to divert resources and may not prove successful 
our protective measures may prove inadequate to protect our proprietary rights  and if we fail to enforce or protect our rights  we could lose valuable assets 
intellectual property infringement claims may be costly to resolve and could divert management attention 
other companies may hold or obtain patents on inventions or may otherwise claim proprietary rights to technology necessary to our business 
the markets in which we compete are comprised of competitors who in some cases hold substantial patent portfolios covering aspects of products that could be similar to ours 
we could become subject to claims that we are infringing patent  trademark  copyright or other proprietary rights of others  and have recently been sued by a substrate competitor concerning alleged patent infringement 
litigation to determine the validity of alleged claims could be time consuming and result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel  whether or not the litigation is ultimately determined in our favor 
if a lawsuit is decided against us  we could be subject to significant liabilities  requiring us to seek costly licenses or preventing us from manufacturing and selling our products 
we may not be able to obtain required licensing agreements on terms acceptable to us or at all 

table of contents as our business matures  we may need to upgrade our systems  or incur additional costs related to regulatory compliance 
in the past  periods of rapid growth and expansion has strained our management and other resources 
the expansion of our manufacturing capacity and the shift of manufacturing operations to china placed and continue to place a significant strain on our operations and management resources 
we recently upgraded our inventory control systems and may implement additional systems relating to consolidation of our financial results 
if we fail to manage these changes effectively  our operations may be disrupted 
to manage our business effectively  we may need to implement additional and improved management information systems  further develop our operating  administrative  financial and accounting systems and controls  add experienced senior level managers  and maintain close coordination among our executive  engineering  accounting  marketing  sales and operations organizations 
if necessary  we will spend substantial sums to support our future growth and shift to china and to comply with the reporting and attestation requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of we may incur additional unexpected costs 
our systems  procedures or controls may not be adequate to support our operations  and we may be unable to expand quickly enough to exploit potential market opportunities 
if we fail to manage periodic contractions  we may utilize our cash balances and our existing cash and cash equivalent balances could decline 
we anticipate that our existing cash resources will fund any anticipated operating losses  purchases of capital equipment and provide adequate working capital for the next twelve months 
however  our liquidity is affected by many factors including  among others  the extent to which we pursue additional capital expenditures  the level of our production  and other factors related to the uncertainties of the industry and global economies 
if we fail to manage our contractions successfully we may draw down our cash reserves  which would adversely affect our operating results and financial condition  reduce our value and may impinge our ability to raise debt and equity funding in the future  at a time when we may be required to raise additional cash 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that events in the future will not require us to seek additional capital  or  if so required  that such capital will be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
as part of our effort to reduce costs  we may lose key staff  production resources  and technology that we will need to grow when end markets recover 
these events could reduce our ability to grow profitably as markets recover 
as a result of the difficult economic conditions  we have implemented restructuring and workforce reductions  which may adversely affect the morale and performance of our personnel and our ability to hire new personnel 
in connection with our efforts to streamline operations  reduce costs and bring staffing and structure in line with demand for our products  we implemented a corporate restructuring beginning in and reduced our workforce  shifted production activities to china  reduced capital expenditures  and discontinued our opto electronics business 
in addition  our stock price is volatile  which can affect the value of stock options issued to our employees 
our restructuring may yield unanticipated consequences  such as attrition beyond our planned reduction in workforce and loss of employee morale and decreased performance 
as a result of these factors  our remaining personnel may seek employment with larger  more established companies or companies that they perceive as having less volatile stock prices 
continuity of personnel can be very important factors in the sales and production of our products and completion of our research and development efforts 

table of contents any future acquisitions may disrupt our business  dilute stockholder value or distract management attention 
as part of our strategy  we may consider acquisitions of  or significant investments in  businesses that offer products  services and technologies complementary to ours 
acquisitions entail numerous risks  including we may have difficulty assimilating the operations  products and personnel of the acquired businesses  our ongoing business may be disrupted  we may incur unanticipated costs  our management may be unable to manage the financial and strategic position of acquired or developed products  services and technologies  we may be unable to maintain uniform standards  controls  procedures  and policies  and our relationships with employees and customers may be impaired as a result of any integration 
for example  we incurred substantial costs in connection with our acquisition of lyte optronics in may  including the assumption of approximately million of debt  which was subsequently repaid  resulting in a decline of cash available 
we also incurred consistent operating losses for the business following the acquisition  and have discontinued all operations and sold the related assets acquired in our acquisition of lyte optronics during to the extent that we issue shares of our stock or other rights to purchase stock in connection with any future acquisitions  dilution to our existing stockholders will result and our earnings per share may suffer 
any future acquisitions may not generate additional revenue or provide any benefit to our business 
if any of our facilities is damaged by actions such as fire  explosion  or natural disaster  we may not be able to manufacture our products 
the ongoing operation of our manufacturing and production facilities in california and china is critical to our ability to meet demand for our products 
if we are not able to use all or a significant portion of our facilities for prolonged periods for any reason  we will not be able to manufacture products for our customers 
for example  a natural disaster  fire or explosion caused by our use of combustible chemicals and high temperatures during our manufacturing processes would render some or all of our facilities inoperable for an indefinite period of time 
actions outside of our control  such as earthquakes  could also damage our facilities  rendering them inoperable 
some of our manufacturing and research and development is currently performed at our fremont  california facilities  which are located near an active seismic fault line 
if we are unable to operate our facilities and manufacture our products  we will lose customers and revenue and our business will be harmed 
if we lose key personnel or are unable to hire additional qualified personnel as necessary  we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our objectives 
our success depends upon the continued service of morris s 
young  phd  our president  chairman of the board and chief executive officer  as well as other key management and technical personnel 
we do not have long term employment contracts with  or key person life insurance on  any of our key personnel 
we believe our future success will also depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled managerial  engineering  sales and marketing  finance and manufacturing personnel 
the competition for these employees is intense and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in attracting and retaining new personnel 
the loss of the services of any of our key personnel  the inability to attract or retain qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring required personnel  particularly engineers  could make it difficult for us to manage our business and meet key objectives  including the timely introduction of new products 

table of contents changes in china s political  social and economic environment may affect our financial performance 
our financial performance may be affected by changes in china s political  social and economic environment 
the role of the chinese central and local governments in the chinese economy is significant 
chinese policies toward economic liberalization  and laws and policies affecting technology companies  foreign investment  currency exchange rates and other matters could change  resulting in greater restrictions on our ability to do business and operate our manufacturing facilities in china 
any imposition of surcharges or any increase in chinese tax rates could hurt our operating results 
the chinese government could revoke  terminate or suspend our license for national security and similar reasons without compensation to us 
if the government of china were to take any of these actions  we would be prevented from conducting all or part of our business 
any failure on our part to comply with governmental regulations could result in the loss of our ability to manufacture our products in china 
china has from time to time experienced instances of civil unrest and hostilities 
confrontations have occurred between the military and civilians 
events of this nature could influence the chinese economy  result in nationalization of foreign owned operations such as ours  and could negatively affect our ability to operate our facilities in china 
the effect of terrorist threats and actions on the general economy could decrease our revenues 
the united states continues to be on alert for terrorist activity 
the potential near and long term impact terrorist activities may have in regards to our suppliers  customers and markets for our products and the us economy are uncertain 
there may be embargos of ports or products  or destruction of shipments or our facilities  or attacks that affect our personnel 
there may be other potential adverse effects on our operating results due to a significant event that we cannot foresee 
our stock price has been and may continue to be volatile 
our stock price has fluctuated significantly since we began trading on the nasdaq national market 
for the year ended december   the high and low closing sales prices of our common stock were and  respectively 
a number of factors could cause the price of our common stock to continue to fluctuate substantially  including actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly or annual operating results  changes in expectations about our future financial performance or changes in financial estimates of securities analysts  announcements of technological innovations by us or our competitors  new product introduction by us or our competitors  large customer orders or order cancellations  and the operating and stock price performance of comparable companies 
in addition  the stock market in general has experienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
these broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock  regardless of our actual operating performance 
we have adopted certain anti takeover measures that may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us 
our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to determine the price  rights  preferences and privileges of those shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders 
the rights of the holders of common stock will be subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
the issuance of shares of preferred stock  while potentially providing desirable flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and for 
table of contents other corporate purposes  could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
we have no present intention to issue shares of preferred stock 
further  on april   our board of directors adopted a preferred stock purchase rights plan intended to guard against certain takeover tactics 
the adoption of this plan was not in response to any proposal to acquire us  and the board is not aware of any such effort 
the existence of this plan could also have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
in addition  certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control  which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
in addition  provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a merger  acquisition or change of control of us  or changes in our management  including the division of our board of directors into three separate classes  each with three year terms  the right of our board to elect a director to fill a space created by a board vacancy or the expansion of the board  the ability of our board to alter our bylaws  the ability of our board to authorize the issuance of up to  shares of blank check preferred stock  and the requirement that only our board or the holders of at least of our outstanding shares may call a special meeting of our stockholders 
furthermore  because we are incorporated in delaware  we are subject to the provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law 
these provisions prohibit large stockholders  in particular those owning or more of the outstanding voting stock  from consummating a merger or combination with a corporation unless of the shares of voting stock not owned by these large stockholders approve the merger or combination  or the board of directors approves the merger or combination or the transaction which resulted in the large stockholder owning or more of our outstanding voting stock 
legislative actions  higher insurance costs and potential new accounting pronouncements are likely to cause our general and administrative expenses to increase and impact our future financial position and results of operations 
in order to comply with the newly adopted sarbanes oxley act of  as well as proposed changes to listing standards by nasdaq  and proposed accounting changes by the securities and exchange commission  we may be required to increase our internal controls  hire additional personnel and additional outside legal  accounting and advisory services  all of which will cause our general and administrative costs to increase 
insurers may increase premiums as a result of the high claims rates they incurred over the past year  and our premiums for our various insurance policies  including our directors and officers insurance policies  increased during proposed changes in the accounting rules  including legislative and other proposals to account for employee stock options as a compensation expense among others  could materially increase the expense that we report under generally accepted accounting principles and adversely affect our operating results 
we need to continue to improve or implement our systems  procedures and controls and may not receive favorable attestation of our internal control systems by our independent auditors 
the new requirements adopted by the securities and exchange commission in response to the passage of the sarbanes oxley act of will require annual review and evaluation of our internal control systems  and attestation of these systems by our independent accountants 
we are currently reviewing our internal control procedures and considering further documentation of such procedures that may be necessary 
however  the 
table of contents guidelines for the evaluation and attestation of internal control systems have not yet been finalized 
furthermore  once the guidelines are finalized  the evaluation and attestation processes will be new and untested 
therefore  we can give no assurances that our systems will satisfy the new requirements of the securities and exchange commission or that we will receive a favorable review and attestation by our independent auditors
