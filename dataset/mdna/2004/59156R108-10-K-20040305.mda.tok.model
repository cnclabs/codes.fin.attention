this discussion should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein 
economic capital beginning in  the company changed its methodology of allocating capital to its business segments from risk based capital rbc to economic capital 
prior to  the company s business segments allocated equity was primarily based on rbc  an internally developed formula based on applying a multiple to the national association of insurance commissioners statutory risk based capital and included certain adjustments in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
economic capital is an internally developed risk capital model  the purpose of which is to measure the risk in the business and to provide a basis upon which capital is deployed 
the economic capital model accounts for the unique and specific nature of the risks inherent in metlife s businesses 
this is in contrast to the standardized regulatory rbc formula  which is not as refined in its risk calculations with respect to the nuances of the company s businesses 
the change in methodology is being applied prospectively 
this change has and will continue to impact the level of net investment income and net income of each of the company s business segments 
a portion of net investment income is credited to the segments based on the level of allocated equity 
this change in methodology of allocating equity does not impact the company s consolidated net investment income or net income 
the following table presents actual and pro forma net investment income with respect to the company s segments for the years ended december  and the amounts shown as pro forma reflect net investment income that would have been reported in these years had the company allocated capital based on economic capital rather than on the basis of rbc 
net investment income for the years ended december  actual pro forma actual pro forma dollars in millions institutional     individual     auto home international reinsurance asset management corporate other total     acquisitions and dispositions in september  a subsidiary of the company  reinsurance group of america  incorporated rga  announced a coinsurance agreement under which it assumed the traditional us life reinsurance business of allianz life insurance company of north america

these acquisitions marked metlife s entrance into the chilean insurance market 
in july  the company completed its sale of conning corporation conning  an affiliate acquired in the acquisition of genamerica financial corporation genamerica in conning specialized in asset management for insurance company investment portfolios and investment research 
summary of critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to adopt accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements 
the critical accounting policies  estimates and related judgments underlying the company s consolidated financial statements are summarized below 
in applying these policies  management makes subjective and complex judgments that frequently require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
many of these policies  estimates and related judgments are common in the insurance and financial services industries  others are specific to the company s businesses and operations 
investments the company s principal investments are in fixed maturities  mortgage loans and real estate  all of which are exposed to three primary sources of investment risk credit  interest rate and market valuation 
the financial statement risks are those associated with the recognition of impairments and income  as well as the determination of fair values 
the assessment of whether impairments have occurred is based on management s case by case evaluation of the underlying reasons for the decline in fair value 
management considers a wide range of factors about the security issuer and uses its best judgment in evaluating the cause of the decline in the estimated fair value of the security and in assessing the prospects for near term recovery 
inherent in management s evaluation of the security are assumptions and estimates about the operations of the issuer and its future earnings potential 
considerations used by the company in the impairment evaluation process include  but are not limited to i the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been below cost  ii the potential for impairments of securities when the issuer is experiencing significant financial difficulties  iii the potential for impairments in an entire industry sector or sub sector  iv the potential for impairments in certain economically depressed geographic locations  v the potential for impairments of securities where the issuer  series of issuers or industry has suffered a catastrophic type of loss or has exhausted natural resources  vi unfavorable changes in forecasted cash flows on asset backed securities  and vii other subjective factors  including concentrations and information obtained from regulators and rating agencies 
in addition  the earnings on certain investments are dependent upon market conditions  which could result in prepayments and changes in amounts to be earned due to changing interest rates or equity markets 
the determination of fair values in the absence of quoted market values is based on i valuation methodologies  ii securities the company deems to be comparable  and iii assumptions deemed appropriate given the circumstances 
the use of different methodologies and assumptions may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts 
in addition  the company enters into certain structured investment transactions  real estate joint ventures and limited partnerships for which the company may be deemed to be the primary beneficiary and  therefore  may be required to consolidate such investments 
the accounting rules for the determination of the primary beneficiary are complex and require evaluation of the contractual rights and obligations associated with each party involved in the entity  an estimate of the entity s expected losses and expected residual returns and the allocation of such estimates to each party 
derivatives the company enters into freestanding derivative transactions primarily to manage the risk associated with variability in cash flows or changes in fair values related to the company s financial assets and liabilities or to changing fair values 
the company also uses derivative instruments to hedge its currency exposure associated with net investments in certain foreign operations 
the company also purchases investment securities  issues certain insurance policies and engages in certain reinsurance contracts that embed derivatives 
the associated financial statement risk is the volatility in net income which can result from i changes in fair value of derivatives not qualifying as accounting hedges  ii ineffectiveness of designated hedges  and iii counterparty default 
in addition  there is a risk that embedded derivatives requiring bifurcation are not identified and reported at fair value in the consolidated financial statements 
accounting for derivatives is complex  as evidenced by significant authoritative interpretations of the primary accounting standards which continue to evolve  as well as the significant judgments and estimates involved in determining fair value in the absence of quoted market values 
these estimates are based on valuation methodologies and assumptions deemed appropriate in the circumstances 
such assumptions include estimated volatility and interest rates used in the determination of fair value where quoted market values are not available 
the use of different assumptions may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts 
deferred policy acquisition costs the company incurs significant costs in connection with acquiring new and renewal insurance business 
these costs  which vary with and are primarily related to the production of that business  are deferred 
the recovery of such costs is dependent upon the future profitability of the related business 
the amount of future profit is dependent principally on investment returns in excess of the amounts credited to policyholders  mortality  morbidity  persistency  interest crediting rates  expenses to administer the business  creditworthiness of reinsurance counterparties and certain economic variables  such as inflation 
of these factors  the company anticipates that investment returns are most likely to impact the rate of amortization of such costs 
the aforementioned factors enter into management s estimates of gross margins and profits  which generally are used to amortize such costs 
revisions to estimates result in changes to the amounts expensed in the reporting period in which the revisions are made and could result in the impairment of the asset and a charge to income if estimated future gross margins and profits are less than amounts deferred 
in addition  the company utilizes the reversion to the mean assumption  a standard industry practice  in its determination of the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs dac  including value of business acquired voba 
this practice assumes that the expectation for long term appreciation in equity markets is not changed by minor short term market fluctuations  but that it does change when large interim deviations have occurred 
future policy benefits the company establishes liabilities for amounts payable under insurance policies  including traditional life insurance  annuities and disability insurance 
generally  amounts are payable over an extended period of time and liabilities are established based on methods and underlying assumptions in accordance with gaap and applicable actuarial standards 
principal assumptions used in the establishment of liabilities for future policy benefits are mortality  morbidity  expenses  persistency  investment returns and inflation 
the company also establishes liabilities for unpaid claims and claims expenses for property and casualty insurance 
liabilities for property and casualty insurance are dependent on estimates of amounts payable for claims reported but not settled and claims incurred but not reported 
these estimates are influenced by historical experience and actuarial assumptions with respect to current developments  anticipated trends and risk management strategies 
differences between the actual experience and assumptions used in pricing these policies and in the establishment of liabilities result in variances in profit and could result in losses 
reinsurance the company enters into reinsurance transactions as both a provider and a purchaser of reinsurance 
accounting for reinsurance requires extensive use of assumptions and estimates  particularly related to the future performance of the underlying business and the potential impact of counterparty credit risks 
the company periodically reviews actual and anticipated experience compared to the aforementioned assumptions used to establish assets and liabilities relating to ceded and assumed reinsurance and evaluates the financial strength of counterparties to its reinsurance agreements using criteria similar to that evaluated in the security impairment process discussed previously 
additionally  for each of its reinsurance contracts  the company must determine if the contract provides indemnification against loss or liability relating to insurance risk  in accordance with applicable accounting standards 
the company must review all contractual features  particularly those that may limit the amount of insurance risk to which the reinsurer is subject or features that delay the timely reimbursement of claims 
if the company determines that a reinsurance contract does not expose the reinsurer to a reasonable possibility of a significant loss from insurance risk  the company records the contract using the deposit method of accounting 
litigation the company is a party to a number of legal actions 
given the inherent unpredictability of litigation  it is difficult to estimate the impact of litigation on the company s consolidated financial position 
liabilities are established when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
liabilities related to certain lawsuits  including the company s asbestos related liability  are especially difficult to estimate due to the limitation of available data and uncertainty regarding numerous variables used to determine amounts recorded 
the data and variables that impact the assumption used to estimate the company s asbestos related liability include the number of future claims  the cost to resolve claims  the disease mix and severity of disease  the jurisdiction of claims filed  tort reform efforts and the impact of any possible future adverse verdicts and their amounts 
it is possible that an adverse outcome in certain of the company s litigation  including asbestos related cases  or the use of different assumptions in the determination of amounts recorded could have a material effect upon the company s consolidated net income or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods 
employee benefit plans the company sponsors pension and other retirement plans in various forms covering employees who meet specified eligibility requirements 
the reported expense and liability associated with these plans requires an extensive use of assumptions which include the discount rate  expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases as determined by the company 
management determines these assumptions based upon currently available market and industry data  historical performance of the plan and its assets  and consultation with an independent consulting actuarial firm to aid it in selecting appropriate assumptions and valuing its related liabilities 
the actuarial assumptions used in the calculation of the company s aggregate projected benefit obligation may vary and include an expectation of long term market appreciation in equity markets which is not changed by minor short term market fluctuations  but does change when large interim deviations occur 
these assumptions used by the company may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of the participants 
these differences may have a significant effect on the company s consolidated financial statements and liquidity 
results of operations year ended december  compared with the year ended december  the company executive summary metlife  inc  through its affiliates and subsidiaries  is a leading provider of insurance and other financial services to a broad spectrum of individual and institutional customers 
the company offers life insurance  annuities  automobile and homeowners insurance and mutual funds to individuals  as well as group insurance  reinsurance  and retirement and savings products and services to corporations and other institutions 
the metlife companies serve approximately million households in the us and provide benefits to approximately million employees and family members through their plan sponsors including of the fortune largest companies 
metlife  inc also has direct international insurance operations in countries serving approximately million customers 
metlife is organized into six business segments institutional  individual  auto home  international  reinsurance and asset management 
the marketplace for financial services is extremely competitive 
metlife  the largest life insurer in the united states  reported billion in net income and diluted earnings per share of for the year ended december  in  after a three year economic slowdown  there were improvements in both the credit and equity markets 
at the same time  interest rates remained at historic lows and the s p index was up for the year 
total premiums and fees increased to billion  up over the prior year  which primarily stems from continued sales growth across most of the company s segments  as well as the positive impact of the us financial markets on policy fees 
assets under management grew to billion  up over the prior year  and individual annuity deposits grew to billion  up over the prior year 
metlife generated over billion of net investment income while adhering to rigorous asset liability management principles and portfolio diversification 
an increase in expenses year over year is primarily attributable to employee related expenses  including pension and postretirement benefit expense and severance  expenses associated with strengthening the company s distribution systems and taking action in consolidating office space and reducing redundancies  while continuing to invest heavily in infrastructure 
in addition  regulatory capital increased and the company repurchased stock through its buyback program 
industry trends the company s segments continue to be influenced by a variety of industry trends and it is the company s belief that each of its businesses is well positioned to capitalize on those trends 
in general  the company is seeing more employers  both large and small  outsourcing their benefits functions 
further  companies are offering broader new arrays of voluntary benefits to help retain employees while adding little to their overall benefits costs 
these trends will likely continue and in fact expand across companies of all sizes 
employers are also demanding substantial online access for their employees for various self service functions 
this functionality requires substantial information technology investment that smaller companies will find difficult to absorb 
this will put pressure on those smaller and mid size companies to gain scale quickly or exit the business 
in addition  alternative benefit structures  such as simple fixed benefit products  are becoming more popular as the traditional medical indemnity products costs have continued to increase rapidly 
these low cost fixed benefit products can provide effective catastrophic protection for high cost illnesses to supplement the basic health coverage provided by medical indemnity insurance 
from a demographics standpoint  the bulk of the us population is moving from an asset accumulation phase to an asset distribution phase 
people within ten years of retirement hold significant assets 
with continually lengthening lifespans and unstructured asset distribution  the company believes many of these people may outlive their retirement savings and or require long term care 
as a result  the company expects that the demand for retirement payout solutions with guarantees will increase dramatically over the next decade 
the combination of these trends will favor those with scale  breadth of distribution and product  ability to provide advice and financial strength to support the long term guarantees

income from continuing operations for the years and includes the impact of certain transactions or events that result in net income not being indicative of future earnings  which are described in the applicable segment s results of operations discussions 
these items contributed an after tax benefit of million in and an after tax charge of million in excluding the impact of these items  income from continuing operations increased by million in compared to the prior year 
declines in after tax net investment losses account for million of this increase with the balance being contributed by the company s operations 
the decline in net investment losses is largely attributable to less credit related losses  which is consistent with the us financial market environment 
the company anticipates net investment losses in to be comparable with levels and continues to reflect a concentration of interest related losses rather than credit related losses 
premiums  fees and other revenues increased over the prior year primarily as a result of growth in the annuities  retirement and savings and variable and universal life product lines 
this increase stems in part from policy fee income earned on annuity deposits  which were billion in  increasing from the prior year 
in addition  the annuity separate account balance was billion at december   up versus the prior year end 
growth in retirement savings is primarily attributable to higher sales in structured settlement products 
fee income from variable and universal life products increased over the prior year primarily as a result of a growth in separate account balances 
in addition  the coinsurance agreement with allianz life in the reinsurance segment contributed approximately to the year over year increase 
partially offsetting these increases is a decline in traditional life premiums  which is largely attributable to run off in the company s closed block of business 
investment margins  which represent the spread between net investment income and interest credited to policyholder account balances  remained favorable in as the company took appropriate crediting rate reductions in most products in an effort to keep pace with the market environment 
in several product lines  where investment margins are a substantial part of earnings  the company still has a reasonable amount of flexibility to reduce crediting rates further if portfolio yields were to decline from year end levels 
investment margins in did benefit from higher than expected levels of prepayments  a trend that is not expected to continue in underwriting results varied in the group life mortality ratio continues to be favorable at 
the individual life mortality ratio was also solid at  which includes the impact of several large claims in the variable and universal product line  some of which had lower levels of reinsurance 
group disability s morbidity ratio increased to  from in the prior year but is still within management s expected range 
the auto home combined ratio  which is a measure of both the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio  as well as the expense ratio  remained favorable at excluding catastrophes 
the company s international segment increased its loss recognition reserve in taiwan as a result of low interest rates relative to product guarantees 
this action resulted in a million after tax charge 
other expenses increased over the prior year period primarily as a result of an increase of million in pension and postretirement expenses 
as a result of contributions made to the pension plan in late and early  which totaled approximately million  and the stronger performance of the pension plan assets in  the company anticipates the pension and postretirement expenses to moderate in other expenses in also include the impact of several actions taken by management in the fourth quarter  including lease terminations  office consolidations and closures  and asset impairments 
in addition  severance costs and expenses associated with strategic initiatives at new england financial contributed to the increase in expenses year over year 
also  there was an increase in many of the product lines volume related expenses  which are in line with business growth 
net investment losses decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the comparable period 
this decrease reflects total investment losses  before offsets  of million 
the company s investment gains and losses are net of related policyholder amounts 
the amounts netted against investment gains and losses are i amortization of dac  to the extent that such amortization results from investment gains and losses  ii adjustments to participating contractholder accounts when amounts equal to such investment gains and losses are applied to the contractholder s accounts  and iii adjustments to the policyholder dividend obligation resulting from investment gains and losses 
offsets include the amortization of dac of million and million in and  respectively  and changes in the policyholder dividend obligation of million and million in and  respectively  and adjustments to participating contracts of million and million in and  respectively 
the dollar amount of the offsets may vary disproportionately with net investment gains and losses based on the relationship of the underlying sold securities to certain insurance products 
the company believes its policy of netting related policyholder amounts against investment gains and losses provides important information in evaluating its performance 
investment gains and losses are often excluded by investors when evaluating the overall financial performance of insurers 
the company believes its presentation enables readers to easily exclude investment gains and losses and the related effects on the consolidated statements of income when evaluating its performance 
the company s presentation of investment gains and losses  net of policyholder amounts  may be different from the presentation used by other insurance companies and  therefore  amounts in its consolidated statements of income may not be comparable to amounts reported by other insurers 
income tax expense for the year ended december  was million  or of income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes and cumulative effect of change in accounting  compared with million  or  for the comparable period 
the effective tax rate differs from the corporate tax rate of primarily due to the impact of non taxable investment income  tax credits for investments in low income housing  a recovery of prior year tax overpayments on tax exempt bonds  and an adjustment consisting primarily of a revision in the estimate of income taxes for in addition  the effective tax rate includes a reduction of the deferred tax valuation allowance related to certain foreign net operating loss carryforwards  and tax benefits related to the sale and merger of foreign subsidiaries reflected in the international segment 
the effective tax rate differs from the corporate tax rate of primarily due to the impact of non taxable investment income  partially offset by the inability to utilize tax benefits on certain foreign capital losses 
income from discontinued operations declined million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million in the comparable prior year period 
the decrease is primarily due to lower recognized net investment gains from real estate properties sold in as compared to the prior year 
the income from discontinued operations is comprised of net investment income and net investment gains related to properties that the company began marketing for sale on or after january  for the years ended december  and  the company recognized million and million of net investment gains  respectively  from discontinued operations related to real estate properties sold or held for sale 
the company changed its method of accounting for embedded derivatives in certain insurance products as required by new accounting guidance which became effective on october   and recorded the impact as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle

income from continuing operations increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the comparable period 
revenue growth combined with favorable underwriting results and interest margins contributed to the year over year increase 
lower net investment losses in versus contributed million after tax to the year over year increase 
favorable underwriting experience was partially offset by an increase in expenses associated with office closures and other consolidations  as well as an increase in pension and postretirement benefit costs 
in addition  the prior year period includes a million after tax benefit from the release of a previously established liability for the company s business realignment initiatives and a million after tax benefit from the release of a previously established liability for disability insurance related losses from the september  tragedies 
total revenues  excluding net investment gains and losses  increased by million  or  to  million for the year ended december  from  million for the comparable period 
the increase is attributable to both the group insurance and the retirement and savings product lines 
within group insurance  life insurance premiums and fees increased by million  or  which is in line with management s expectations 
this increase is attributable primarily to higher sales and favorable persistency 
the late acquisition of the john hancock block of group life business contributed million to this increase 
in addition  the long term care  dental  and disability products experienced continued growth at a combined rate of approximately  which is in line with management s expectations 
retirement and savings revenues increased approximately primarily due to higher sales in the structured settlement products partially offset by the impact of a sale of a significant  single premium contract in the second quarter of premiums and fees from retirement and saving products are significantly influenced by large transactions and  as a result  can fluctuate from period to period 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in revenues primarily due to a decline in retirement and savings administrative fees from the company s k business 
this decline resulted from the exit from the large market k business in late consequently  revenue decreased as business was transferred to other carriers throughout total expenses increased by million  or  to  million for the year ended december  from  million for the comparable period

the ratio was within management s expected range 
in addition  the period includes a million release of a previously established liability for disability insurance related losses from the september  tragedies 
other expenses increased by million over the prior year period 
group insurance and retirement and savings expenses increased million primarily due to an increase in non deferrable expenses associated with the aforementioned revenue growth  million from an increase in pension and postretirement benefit expense  and a million increase in expenses associated with office closures and other consolidations

income from continuing operations decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the comparable period 
the decrease year over year is primarily driven by an increase in expenses of million  or  which is largely attributable to an increase in expenses associated with office closures and other consolidations  pension and postretirement benefit costs  an increase in legal related costs and an adjustment related to certain improperly deferred expenses at new england financial 
although revenues are essentially flat year over year  policy fees from variable life and annuity and investment type products grew year over year 
in addition  there is a slight increase in premiums related to other traditional life products 
these increases are offset by a decline in premiums from the company s closed block business  which consists of participating policies issued prior to the company s demutualization 
premiums on the closed block represent approximately of this segment s premiums for the year ended december  total revenues  excluding net investment gains and losses  decreased by million  or less than  to  million for the year ended december  from  million for the comparable period 
policy fees from variable life and annuity and investment type products grew by over the prior year period 
this growth is primarily a result of an increase in the average separate account balances  which is largely attributable to improvements in the us financial markets 
additionally  this increase is associated with the aging of the in force policies  as well as an increase in the sales of the enterprise variable annuity product through non traditional distribution channels 
policy fees from variable life and annuity and investment type products are typically calculated as a percentage of average assets 
the value of these assets can fluctuate depending on equity market performance 
this increase in policy fee income was almost entirely offset by declines in premiums and net investment income 
premiums associated with the company s closed block of business declined by million  or  which is in line with management s expectations  as this business continues to run off 
partially offsetting this decline is a slight increase in the other traditional life products 
the decline in net investment income is mainly due to the change in capital allocation methodology and lower investment yields year over year 
total expenses increased by million  or  to  million for the year ended december  from  million for the comparable period 
other expenses increased by million over the prior year period primarily as a result of expenses associated with certain efficiency initiatives and events 
the most significant items include an increase of million from pension and postretirement benefit expense  a million expense recorded in the second quarter of for an adjustment related to certain improperly deferred expenses at new england financial  million in expenses associated with office closures and other consolidations  million increase in legal related costs  and other expenses associated with strategic initiatives at new england financial 
offsetting these expense increases are a decline in policyholder benefits consistent with the aforementioned decline in the closed block and a decrease in dividends due to the reduction of the dividend scale in the fourth quarter of  reflecting the impact of the low us interest rate environment on the asset portfolios supporting these policies

auto home primarily sells auto and homeowners insurance 
net income increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the comparable period 
the increase in earnings year over year is mainly due to premium growth  lower investment losses and a reduction in expenses  partially offset by adverse claims development 
total revenues  excluding net investment gains and losses  increased by million  or  to  million for the year ended december  from  million for the comparable period 
this variance is mainly due to increases in the average earned premium due to rate increases  partially offset by lower investment income primarily resulting from the change in capital allocation methodology 
total expenses increased by million  or  to  million for the year ended december  from  million for the comparable period 
adverse claims development related to prior accident years  resulting mostly from bodily injury and uninsured motorists claims  accounted for million of the increase in policyholder benefits 
also contributing to this increase are higher catastrophe losses of million 
partially offsetting these increases are improved non catastrophe homeowners claims frequencies  a reduction in the number of auto and homeowners policies in force  and underwriting and agency management actions 
in addition  there was a million reduction in expenses resulting from the completion of the st 
paul integration and a million reduction in the cost associated with the new york assigned risk plan

these increases are partially offset by a million after tax charge in taiwan related to an increased loss recognition reserve due to low interest rates relative to product guarantees 
total revenues  excluding net investment gains and losses  increased by million  or  to  million for the year ended december  from  million for the comparable period 
this increase is primarily due to the acquisition of hidalgo  which accounted for million of the variance  partially offset by decreases in canada of million attributable to a non recurring sale of an annuity contract and million relating to the restructuring of a pension contract from an investment type product to a long term annuity  both of which occurred in in addition  south korea s  chile s and taiwan s revenues increased by million  million and million  respectively  primarily due to business growth 
these increases are partially offset by a million decrease in mexico  excluding hidalgo 
anticipated actions taken by the mexican government adversely impacted the insurance and annuities market and resulted in a decline in premiums in mexico s group and individual life businesses 
in addition  the cancellation of a large broker sponsored case at the end of and the weakening of the peso also contributed to the decline in mexico 
total expenses increased by million  or  to  million for the year ended december  from  million for the comparable period

litigation 
various litigation claims and assessments against the company have arisen in the course of the company s business  including  but not limited to  in connection with its activities as an insurer  employer  investor  investment advisor and taxpayer 
further  state insurance regulatory authorities and other federal and state authorities regularly make inquiries and conduct investigations concerning the company s compliance with applicable insurance and other laws and regulations 
it is not feasible to predict or determine the ultimate outcome of all pending investigations and legal proceedings or provide reasonable ranges of potential losses except with respect to certain matters 
in some of the matters  very large and or indeterminate amounts  including punitive and treble damages  are sought 
although in light of these considerations  it is possible that an adverse outcome in certain cases could have a material adverse effect upon the company s consolidated financial position  based on information currently known by the company s management  in its opinion  the outcomes of such pending investigations and legal proceedings are not likely to have such an effect 
however  given the large and or indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these matters and the inherent unpredictability of litigation  it is possible that an adverse outcome in certain matters could  from time to time  have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated net income or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods 
based on management s analysis of its expected cash inflows from operating activities  the dividends it receives from subsidiaries  including metropolitan life  that are permitted to be paid without prior insurance regulatory approval and its portfolio of liquid assets and other anticipated cash flows  management believes there will be sufficient liquidity to enable the company to make payments on debt  make cash dividend payments on its common stock  pay all operating expenses and meet its other obligations 
the nature of the company s diverse product portfolio and customer base lessen the likelihood that normal operations will result in any significant strain on liquidity

in addition  growth in metlife bank s customer deposits  accelerated prepayments of mortgage backed securities that have been previously purchased at a premium  and an increase in funds withheld related to reinsurance activity contributed to the increase in operating cash flows 
these items were partially offset by the company s contribution to its qualified defined benefit plans in december net cash provided by operating activities was  million and  million for the years ended december  and  respectively

the company monitors fixed maturities to identify investments that management considers to be potential problems or problems 
the company also monitors investments that have been restructured 
the company defines potential problem securities in the fixed maturity category as securities of an issuer deemed to be experiencing significant operating problems or difficult industry conditions 
the company uses various criteria  including the following  to identify potential problem securities debt service coverage or cash flow falling below certain thresholds which vary according to the issuer s industry and other relevant factors  significant declines in revenues or margins  violation of financial covenants  public securities trading at a substantial discount as a result of specific credit concerns  and other subjective factors 
the company defines problem securities in the fixed maturities category as securities with principal or interest payments in default  securities to be restructured pursuant to commenced negotiations  or securities issued by a debtor that has entered into bankruptcy 
the company defines restructured securities in the fixed maturities category as securities to which the company has granted a concession that it would not have otherwise considered but for the financial difficulties of the obligor 
the company enters into a restructuring when it believes it will realize a greater economic value under the new terms rather than through liquidation or disposition 
the terms of the restructuring may involve some or all of the following characteristics a reduction in the interest rate  an extension of the maturity date  an exchange of debt for equity or a partial forgiveness of principal or interest 
the following table presents the estimated fair value of the company s total fixed maturities classified as performing  potential problem  problem and restructured at december  december  estimated of estimated of fair value total fair value total dollars in millions performing   potential problem problem restructured total   fixed maturity impairment 
the company classifies all of its fixed maturities as available for sale and marks them to market through other comprehensive income 
all securities with gross unrealized losses at the consolidated balance sheet date are subjected to the company s process for identifying other than temporary impairments 
the company writes down to fair value securities that it deems to be other than temporarily impaired in the period the securities are deemed to be so impaired 
the assessment of whether such impairment has occurred is based on management s case by case evaluation of the underlying reasons for the decline in fair value 
management considers a wide range of factors  as described below  about the security issuer and uses its best judgment in evaluating the cause of the decline in the estimated fair value of the security and in assessing the prospects for near term recovery 
inherent in management s evaluation of the security are assumptions and estimates about the operations of the issuer and its future earnings potential 
considerations used by the company in the impairment evaluation process include  but are not limited to  the following length of time and the extent to which the market value has been below amortized cost  potential for impairments of securities when the issuer is experiencing significant financial difficulties  including a review of all securities of the issuer  including its known subsidiaries and affiliates  regardless of the form of the company s ownership  potential for impairments in an entire industry sector or sub sector  potential for impairments in certain economically depressed geographic locations  potential for impairments of securities where the issuer  series of issuers or industry has suffered a catastrophic type of loss or has exhausted natural resources  and other subjective factors  including concentrations and information obtained from regulators and rating agencies 
the company s review of its fixed maturities for impairments includes an analysis of the total gross unrealized losses by three categories of securities i securities where the estimated fair value had declined and remained below amortized cost by less than  ii securities where the estimated fair value had declined and remained below amortized cost by or more for less than six months  and iii securities where the estimated value had declined and remained below amortized cost by or more for six months or greater 
the first two categories have generally been adversely impacted by the downturn in the financial markets and overall economic conditions 
while all of these securities are monitored for potential impairment  the company s experience indicates that the first two categories do not present as great a risk of impairment  and often  fair values recover over time as the factors that caused the declines improve 
the company records writedowns as investment losses and adjusts the cost basis of the fixed maturities accordingly 
the company does not change the revised cost basis for subsequent recoveries in value 
writedowns of fixed maturities were million and  million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the company s three largest writedowns totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the circumstances that gave rise to these impairments were either financial restructurings or bankruptcy filings

all securities with gross unrealized losses at the consolidated balance sheet date are subjected to the company s process for identifying other than temporary impairments 
the company writes down to fair value securities that it deems to be other than temporarily impaired in the period the securities are deemed to be so impaired 
the assessment of whether such impairment has occurred is based on management s case by case evaluation of the underlying reasons for the decline in fair value 
management considers a wide range of factors  as described below  about the security issuer and uses its best judgment in evaluating the cause of the decline in the estimated fair value of the security and in assessing the prospects for near term recovery 
inherent in management s evaluation of the security are assumptions and estimates about the operations of the issuer and its future earnings potential 
considerations used by the company in the impairment evaluation process include  but are not limited to  the following length of time and the extent to which the market value has been below cost  potential for impairments of securities when the issuer is experiencing significant financial difficulties  including a review of all securities of the issuer  including its known subsidiaries and affiliates  regardless of the form of the company s ownership  potential for impairments in an entire industry sector or sub sector  potential for impairments in certain economically depressed geographic locations  potential for impairments of securities where the issuer  series of issuers or industry has suffered a catastrophic type of loss or has exhausted natural resources  and other subjective factors  including concentrations and information obtained from regulators and rating agencies

while all of these securities are monitored for potential impairment  the company s experience indicates that the first two categories do not present as great a risk of impairment  and often  fair values recover over time as the factors that caused the declines improve 
the following table presents the total gross unrealized losses for equity securities at december  where the estimated fair value had declined and remained below cost by december  gross unrealized of losses total dollars in millions less than or more for less than six months or more for six months or greater total the category of equity securities where the estimated fair value has declined and remained below cost by less than is comprised of equity securities with a cost of million and a gross unrealized loss of million

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company must effectively manage  measure and monitor the market risk associated with its invested assets and interest rate sensitive insurance contracts 
it has developed an integrated process for managing risk  which it conducts through its corporate risk management department  several asset liability committees and additional specialists at the business segment level 
the company has established and implemented comprehensive policies and procedures at both the corporate and business segment level to minimize the effects of potential market volatility 
market risk exposures the company has exposure to market risk through its insurance operations and investment activities 
for purposes of this disclosure  market risk is defined as the risk of loss resulting from changes in interest rates  equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rates 
the company s exposure to interest rate changes results from its significant holdings of fixed maturities  as well as its interest rate sensitive liabilities 
the fixed maturities include us and foreign government bonds  securities issued by government agencies  corporate bonds and mortgage backed securities  all of which are mainly exposed to changes in medium and long term treasury rates 
the interest rate sensitive liabilities for purposes of this disclosure include guaranteed interest contracts and fixed annuities  which have the same interest rate exposure medium and long term treasury rates as the fixed maturities 
the company employs product design  pricing and asset liability management strategies to reduce the adverse effects of interest rate volatility 
product design and pricing strategies include the use of surrender charges or restrictions on withdrawals in some products 
asset liability management strategies include the use of derivatives  the purchase of securities structured to protect against prepayments  prepayment restrictions and related fees on mortgage loans and consistent monitoring of the pricing of the company s products in order to better match the duration of the assets and the liabilities they support 
equity prices 
the company s investments in equity securities expose it to changes in equity prices 
it manages this risk on an integrated basis with other risks through its asset liability management strategies 
the company also manages equity price risk through industry and issuer diversification and asset allocation techniques 
foreign currency exchange rates 
the company s exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the us dollar results from its holdings in non us dollar denominated fixed maturity securities and equity securities and through its investments in foreign subsidiaries 
the principal currencies which create foreign currency exchange rate risk in the company s investment portfolios are canadian dollars  mexican pesos  chilean pesos and british pounds 
the company mitigates the majority of its fixed maturities foreign currency exchange rate risk through the utilization of foreign currency swaps and forward contracts 
through its investments in foreign subsidiaries  the company is primarily exposed to the mexican peso and south korean won 
the company has denominated substantially all assets and liabilities of its foreign subsidiaries in their respective local currencies  thereby minimizing its risk to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
risk management corporate risk management 
metlife has established several financial and non financial senior management committees as part of its risk management process 
these committees manage capital and risk positions  approve asset liability management strategies and establish appropriate corporate business standards 
metlife also has a separate corporate risk management department  which is responsible for risk throughout metlife and reports to metlife s chief financial officer 
the corporate risk management department s primary responsibilities consist of implementing a board of directors approved corporate risk framework  which outlines the company s approach for managing risk on an enterprise wide basis  developing policies and procedures for managing  measuring and monitoring those risks identified in the corporate risk framework  establishing appropriate corporate risk tolerance levels  deploying capital on an economic capital basis  and reporting on a periodic basis to the governance committee of the holding company s board of directors and various financial and non financial senior management committees 
asset liability management 
at metlife  asset liability management is the responsibility of the general account portfolio management department gapm  the operating business segments and various gapm boards 
the gapm boards are comprised of senior officers from the investment department  senior managers from each business segment and the executive vice president in charge of risk management at metlife 
the gapm boards duties include setting broad asset liability management policy and strategy  reviewing and approving target portfolios  establishing investment guidelines and limits  and providing oversight of the portfolio management process 
the portfolio managers and asset sector specialists  who have responsibility on a day to day basis for risk management of their respective investing activities  implement the goals and objectives established by the gapm boards 
the goals of the investment process are to optimize after tax  risk adjusted investment income and after tax  risk adjusted total return while ensuring that the assets and liabilities are managed on a cash flow and duration basis 
the risk management objectives established by the gapm boards stress quality  diversification  asset liability matching  liquidity and investment return 
each of metlife s business segments has an asset liability officer who works with portfolio managers in the investment department to monitor investment  product pricing  hedge strategy and liability management issues 
metlife establishes target asset portfolios for each major insurance product  which represent the investment strategies used to profitably fund its liabilities within acceptable levels of risk 
these strategies include objectives for effective duration  yield curve sensitivity  convexity  liquidity  asset sector concentration and credit quality 
to manage interest rate risk  the company performs periodic projections of asset and liability cash flows to evaluate the potential sensitivity of its securities investments and liabilities to interest rate movements 
these projections involve evaluating the potential gain or loss on most of the company s in force business under various increasing and decreasing interest rate environments 
the company has developed models of its in force business that reflect specific product characteristics and include assumptions based on current and anticipated experience regarding lapse  mortality and interest crediting rates 
in addition  these models include asset cash flow projections reflecting interest payments  sinking fund payments  principal payments  bond calls  mortgage prepayments and defaults 
new york insurance department regulations require that metlife perform some of these analyses annually as part of the annual proof of the sufficiency of its regulatory reserves to meet adverse interest rate scenarios

metlife also uses foreign currency swaps and foreign currency forwards to hedge its foreign currency denominated fixed income investments 
economic capital 
beginning in  the company changed its methodology of allocating capital to its business segments from rbc to economic capital 
prior to  the company s business segments allocated equity was primarily based on rbc  an internally developed formula based on applying a multiple to the naic statutory risk based capital and includes certain gaap accounting adjustments 
economic capital is an internally developed risk capital model  the purpose of which is to measure the risk in the business and to provide a basis upon which capital is deployed 
the economic capital model accounts for the unique and specific nature of the risks inherent in metlife s businesses 
this is in contrast to the standardized regulatory rbc formula  which is not as refined in its risk calculations with respect to the nuances of the company s businesses 
this change in methodology is being applied prospectively 
this change has and will continue to impact the level of net investment income and net income of each of the company s business segments 
a portion of net investment income is credited to the segments based on the level of allocated equity 
this change in methodology of allocating equity does not impact the company s consolidated net investment income or net income 
risk measurement  sensitivity analysis the company measures market risk related to its holdings of invested assets and other financial instruments  including certain market risk sensitive insurance contracts other financial instruments  based on changes in interest rates  equity prices and currency exchange rates  utilizing a sensitivity analysis 
this analysis estimates the potential changes in fair value  cash flows and earnings based on a hypothetical change increase or decrease in interest rates  equity prices and currency exchange rates 
the company believes that a change increase or decrease in these market rates and prices is reasonably possible in the near term 
in performing this analysis  the company used market rates at december  to re price its invested assets and other financial instruments 
the sensitivity analysis separately calculated each of metlife s market risk exposures interest rate  equity price and foreign currency exchange rate related to its non trading invested assets and other financial instruments 
the company does not maintain a trading portfolio 
the sensitivity analysis performed included the market risk sensitive holdings described above 
the company modeled the impact of changes in market rates and prices on the fair values of its invested assets  earnings and cash flows as follows fair values 
the company bases its potential change in fair values on an immediate change increase or decrease in the net present values of its interest rate sensitive exposures resulting from a change increase or decrease in interest rates  the us dollar equivalent balances of the company s currency exposures due to a change increase or decrease in currency exchange rates  and the market value of its equity positions due to a change increase or decrease in equity prices 
earnings and cash flows 
metlife calculates the potential change in earnings and cash flows on the change in its earnings and cash flows over a one year period based on an immediate change increase or decrease in market rates and equity prices 
the following factors were incorporated into the earnings and cash flows sensitivity analyses the reinvestment of fixed maturity securities  the reinvestment of payments and prepayments of principal related to mortgage backed securities  the re estimation of prepayment rates on mortgage backed securities for each change increase or decrease in the interest rates  and the expected turnover sales of fixed maturities and equity securities  including the reinvestment of the resulting proceeds
