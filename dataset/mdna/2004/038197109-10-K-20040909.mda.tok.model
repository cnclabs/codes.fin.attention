item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation overview we are a leading provider of thin film deposition equipment to diverse markets such as the flat panel display  the architectural and solar glass  and the consumer products packaging and electronics industries 
our deposition systems are used to deposit thin films that enhance the characteristics of a base substrate  such as glass  plastic  paper or foil 
these thin films provide conductive  electronic  reflective  filter  barrier and other properties that are critical elements of our customers products 
our thin film deposition systems provide our customers with high yield and throughput  flexible modular configurations  and innovative coating and process technologies 
we have exited the contract coated glass business over the last six years 
beginning in fiscal  we moved the majority of our production of coated glass from longmont to our china jv 
because of the ownership structure of our china jv  the revenues and expenses of our china jv are not consolidated and do not appear as revenues and expenses in our financial statements 
our portion of the china jv net income is reported as equity earnings of joint venture in our consolidated statements of operations 
in september  we sold our longmont coatings division  which included certain assets related to our contract glass coating business  to optera  inc in september  we sold our coated glass sales business located in hong kong to nsg 
the financial statements for the prior periods have been restated to reflect the effect of the sale of those businesses and the results have been included as discontinued operations 
over the last four years we have enhanced our position as a market leading manufacturer of thin film deposition equipment 
in december  we completed the acquisition of the lac business of unaxis which improved our position in fpd and enabled our entry into additional markets 
in june  we completed the acquisition of the in line systems division of helix technology  inc in taiwan 
the acquisition provided us with an additional people who are familiar with our products  as well as a facility that will serve as our asian manufacturing base  where we expect to manufacture some of our display systems beginning late in fiscal we believe manufacturing in taiwan will allow us to reduce our manufacturing and shipping costs and reduce the transit time for systems sold to our customers in asia 
the addition of technical personnel in asia will also enhance our customer service 
revenues for our thin film deposition equipment are generally recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting  measured by the percentage of the total costs incurred in relation to the estimated total costs to be incurred for each contract 
we operate with a certain amount of unrecognized revenue  which we refer to as backlog  on our contracts in progress 
customers usually make progress payments during the term of the contract 
we usually receive approximately to of the purchase price in cash or letter of credit prior to shipment 
our average manufacturing lead time is between nine and twelve months 
backlog was million at the end of fiscal  million at the end of fiscal and million at the end of fiscal export revenues generated from customers outside of europe were in fiscal compared to for fiscal since the helix acquisition closed in june  no revenues were generated from our facility in taiwan 
sales of our systems and backlog are denominated in euros and  unless hedged  are subject to fluctuation changes in the valuation of the foreign currencies against the dollar 
should we engage in a sales contract other than denominated in euros  we will usually enter into currency hedging transactions to mitigate our foreign exchange exposure for the duration of the contract 
the effects of foreign exchange rate changes on non euro denominated contracts have not been significant to date 
net revenues in euros reported in equivalent us dollars were approximately million for fiscal and million for fiscal as of june   the us dollar equivalent of accounts receivable denominated in euros was approximately million  or approximately  of total accounts receivable 
as of june   the us dollar equivalent of accounts payable denominated in euros was approximately million  or approximately  of total accounts payable 
page of results of operations the following table sets forth information derived from the respective consolidated statements of operations expressed as a percentage of net revenues for the periods indicated 
the amounts below have been adjusted to show the operating results of our coated glass divisions in longmont and hong kong that were sold as discontinued operations

amortization of other intangible assets in process research and development interest income  net other income  net equity earnings of joint venture income tax expense backlog net revenues 
the increase in net revenues reflects revenue from record levels of fpd related order activity including equipment orders for generation   and substrate sizes during fiscal compared with strong equipment order activity for generation and substrate sizes from fpd customers during fiscal we began fiscal year with a strong backlog of our architectural glass deposition equipment 
our backlog of million at the end of fiscal was down compared to our million in backlog at the end of fiscal primarily due to fewer orders in the fourth quarter of fiscal for our display equipment 
page of gross profit 
the increase in gross profits in fiscal compared to fiscal was due primarily to the growth in revenues and the ability for better fixed cost absorption 
gross margins increased from in fiscal to in fiscal driven by our product mix and by the implementation of our cost reduction strategies throughout all of our products 
in process research and development 
during the fiscal year ended june   we recorded a million non recurring charge to write off in process research and development ipr d costs attributed to the acquisition of the in line systems division of helix technology  inc  taiwan the in line division 
several projects were included  of which the principal projects were based on the following technologies transparent conductive coating on glass substrate for touch panel displays  a display machine for application in glass using x mm substrates  an anti reflective coating system for display  and a high precision plate with low thermal expansion and high compression resistance 
the allocation of the purchase price  including the valuation of the ipr d  will undergo an independent assessment to validate the carrying value and to assess the reasonableness of the ipr d charge of million that was taken in the fourth quarter of fiscal the company anticipates this assessment to be completed by the end of fiscal year the following table discloses the complete ipr d percentage  the estimated value and the estimated completion date of each project at the june  acquisition date dollars in thousands projects complete at acquisition estimated value estimated completion date at time of acquisition touch panel coating march project zh january g ar coater  january ceramic heaters january total  the estimates used in valuing ipr d were based upon assumptions we believe to be reasonable  but are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
risks and uncertainties associated with completing development within a reasonable period of time include the completion of all planning  designing and testing activities that are necessary to create a product that provides the functions  features and technical performance requirements suited for the market and requested by our customers 
actual results may vary from potential results 
in analyzing the ipr d acquired  we will explore the technologies listed above for further development and potential integration in our current product offerings 
however  it is unlikely that we would continue to market the helix products as they are either not compatible with our current market focus or they are products similar to those we currently market 
research and development 
research and development expenses grew in fiscal compared to fiscal our research and development efforts were concentrated during the fiscal year on fpd related products targeted towards larger glass sizes  including generation and glass sizes and the development of our recently introduced triton system 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries  outside contractors  lab  and other expenses related to our ongoing product and technology initiatives 
as a percentage of net revenues and due to the growth in revenues  research and development expenses declined to in fiscal from in fiscal selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal  as we experienced cost increases related to directors officers insurance  compensation costs  professional fees related to compliance with the sarbanes oxley act  as well as  additional costs absorbed for the taiwan employees while they are in their initial training period 
however  as a result of the increased sales revenue  selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues declined from in fiscal to in fiscal amortization of other intangible assets 
in the fiscal year ended june   amortization of other intangible assets related to our acquisitions was million compared to million in the prior fiscal year 
the majority of this increase was currency related due to the strength of the euro compared to the us dollar 
the intangible assets are carried on the balance sheets of our german and taiwan subsidiaries and the ongoing amortization will fluctuate based on the strength of the euro and the new taiwan dollar compared to the us dollar 
in june  we completed the helix acquisition in taiwan 
as a result of that acquisition we have increased our intangible asset balances related to the patents and customer lists that were acquired in the transaction 
the patents will be amortized over seven years and the customer lists will be amortized over five years 
we expect the amortization of other intangible assets to increase in the future to include these charges 
page of interest income  net 
at the end of fiscal  our average annual investment yield was compared to at the end of fiscal we earned a net million on our invested cash in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the million in fiscal includes a negative mark to market adjustment of  through april  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we changed the accounting designation for our investment securities from trading securities to securities held for sale 
we had an unrealized loss  net of tax  of  that was recorded in other comprehensive income for fiscal year in the future in accordance with sfas  only realized income from investments will be reported in the statement of operations and all unrealized gains and losses will be reported in other comprehensive income in the equity section of the balance sheet 
although the annual yield was significantly reduced  net interest income increased as a result of the investment of cash that was raised during a follow on offering of additional common stock in october other income  net 
net other income includes items such as realized foreign currency transaction adjustments and an approximate royalty on our china jv sales 
the majority of the increase was related to an increase in realized foreign currency translation gains compared to the prior year 
during the fiscal year  the china jv renegotiated the terms of their line of credit  after which our corporate guaranty was no longer required 
the cash balance in euros that was used to secure the guaranty was released  and was repatriated to the us we realized a gain on the transaction 
equity earnings of joint venture 
the increase in equity earnings was primarily due to the increase in the demand for color stn glass supplied by the china jv to the market for cellular telephones with color displays 
income tax expense 
the income tax expense reflects the tax effect of the earnings of each operating subsidiary and their respective tax rates 
the income tax expense for fiscal increased as we reported record net income during the fiscal year 
additionally  we recorded a valuation allowance against a portion of the deferred tax asset because we believe it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
there are several items which lower our effective tax rates in some of the countries in which we operate  such as the tax effect of the amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets in germany  tax free investment and interest income in the us  and equity earnings of our china jv which are reported as tax free because the earnings will be permanently reinvested in our china jv 
we are also applying for a tax holiday status in taiwan related to our subsidiary corporation that was formed to complete the helix acquisition 
our effective tax rate for fiscal was compared to for fiscal discontinued operations 
on september   we sold our hong kong coated glass business to nsg for million in cash and a note receivable 
we accounted for the sale as a discontinuance of business and our financial statements have been restated to reflect our business without the results of our hong kong coated glass business 
the  loss from discontinued operations reflected the operating results of that discontinued business of  from june  through september  combined with the settlement paid to optera  inc of  net of  for taxes 
the  gain was the after tax gain on the sale of assets related to discontinued operations 
page of year ended june  compared to year ended june  the following table presents certain key highlights from the results of operations for the fiscal years ended june  and june  fiscal year ended june  june  percent change in millions net revenues gross profit research and development selling  general and administrative expenses amortization of other intangible assets interest income  net other income  net equity earnings of joint venture income tax expense backlog net revenues 
this increase reflects orders from taiwanese display customers during fiscal compared with no order activity from taiwan during fiscal we had strong orders and increased revenues from our architectural glass customers during fiscal which led to an increase in equipment backlog from million at the end of fiscal to million at the end of fiscal gross profit 
the increase in gross profits was due primarily to the revenue growth as gross margins were in both fiscal and fiscal research and development 
in fiscal  growth in research and development for fpd related products was driven by the development efforts targeted towards larger glass sizes  including generation and glass sizes 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries  outside contractor  lab  and other expenses related to our ongoing product and technology development for fpd  oled  solar  and plastic bottle processes and other research and development programs 
as a percentage of net revenues  research and development expenses were in fiscal and in fiscal selling  general and administrative 
as a result of cost management initiatives introduced in fiscal  selling  general and administrative expenses increased only in fiscal as a percentage of net revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses declined from in fiscal to in fiscal amortization of other intangible assets 
in the fiscal year ended june   amortization of other intangible assets related to the lac acquisition was million 
in the fiscal year ended june   amortization of other intangible assets was million 
the increase in amortization of other intangible assets was due to the currency fluctuation between the us dollar and the euro 
the intangible assets are carried on the balance sheet of our german subsidiary and the strength of the euro during fiscal increased this amortization amount as it is reported in us dollars 
interest income  net 
at the end of fiscal  our average investment yield was compared to at the end of fiscal the increase in net interest income resulted from excess cash that was invested after the equity offering which closed in november this excess cash was invested for only part of the fiscal year as compared to a full year of investment in fiscal other income  net 
net other income includes items such as realized foreign currency transaction adjustments and royalties earned from our china jv 
we receive an approximate royalty on all sales by our china jv  payable quarterly 
in fiscal   was reported for the reversal of unused reserves for the completion of the building in alzenau  germany 
in fiscal  net other income resulted primarily from realized currency translation 
equity earnings of joint venture 
the increase in equity earnings was primarily due to increased demand for cellular telephones with color displays 
income tax expense 
the income tax expense reflects the tax effect of the earnings of each operating subsidiary and their respective tax rates 
the income tax expense for fiscal was increased by a valuation allowance against a portion of the deferred tax asset because we believe it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
there are several items which lower our effective tax rates in some of the countries in which we operate  such as the tax effect of the amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets in germany  tax free investment and interest income in the us  and equity earnings of our china jv which are reported as tax free because the earnings will be permanently reinvested in our china jv as a permanent investment 
page of discontinued operations 
on september   we sold our longmont coatings division to optera  inc for million in cash 
we accounted for the sale as a discontinuance of business and our financial statements have been restated to reflect our business without the results of our longmont coatings division 
the  loss reflected the operating results of that business for june  through september  the  gain reflected the after tax gain on the sale of assets related to discontinued operations

the volume of equipment sales is significantly dependent on our customers capital spending patterns 
during fiscal  we experienced a strong flow of orders for our systems across all of our product lines  but specifically orders for our new aristo system for the fpd market and our terra g system for the architectural glass market which delivered a balance of revenue across our product areas and provided the momentum that resulted in growth in backlog to record levels of million at the end of fiscal from million at the end of fiscal  and growth in revenues to a high of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal up from the million recognized in the first quarter of fiscal during fiscal  we began the fiscal year with record backlog of million and we recorded strong orders across all of our product lines 
we experienced a record order volume for our new aristo system for the fpd market during the second and third fiscal quarters 
our web coater products recorded consistent orders throughout the year while orders for our terra g glass coating platform were lower than the prior year as we experienced two quarters with no bookings  and we worked through the backlog from the prior year 
as the volume of display orders decreased during the fourth quarter  we ended fiscal year with a backlog of million down from the million in backlog at the end of fiscal following the first fiscal quarter of fiscal  we recorded three consecutive record revenue quarters growing by from million in the first fiscal quarter to million in the fourth fiscal quarter as bookings momentum in the fpd market led to a record number of new aristo systems being built in our factory 
during fiscal  we reported growth in gross profits setting new records each quarter consistent with the growth in revenues 
gross margins increased to record levels as well driven by our product mix and by the implementation of our cost reduction strategies throughout all of our products 
in the fpd market  we sold larger new aristo systems to multiple customers for generation and generation sized substrates 
selling  general and administrative expenses grew from fiscal through associated with the professional fees related to the compliance of sarbanes oxley section  increased premiums for directors and officers insurance  as well as other compensation related expenses 
our selling  general and administrative rose to million in the fourth quarter of fiscal we expect that a portion of the growth in selling  general and administrative costs experienced in the fourth fiscal quarter resulted from one time charges that should not reoccur 
however  we believe that with the permanent inclusion of the costs associated with the compliance with sarbanes oxley section  we will not return to the lower selling  general and administrative levels we reported prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal page of our focus on flat panel display drove our increase in research and development 
with the fpd industry roll out of generation and glass sizes  we have invested in upsizing our new aristo system to handle these larger glass sizes 
we also invested in research and development for the development of our triton system for the tft array market 
the triton system was introduced in june at the fpd show in taiwan 
we continue to develop emerging technologies related to our oled and solar products
