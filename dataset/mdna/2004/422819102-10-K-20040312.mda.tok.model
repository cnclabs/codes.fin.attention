executive overview our business we are a premier provider of executive search and leadership consulting services 
we help our clients build leadership teams by facilitating the recruitment  assessment and development of personnel for their executive management positions 
in addition to executive search for permanent and interim placements  we provide other leadership services  including executive assessment  and  through an alliance  executive coaching 
we provide our services to a broad range of clients through our worldwide network of consultants located in countries throughout the world 
our executive search services are provided on a retained basis 
revenue before reimbursements of out of pocket expenses net revenue consists of retainers and indirect expenses billed to clients 
typically  we are paid a retainer for our executive search services equal to approximately one third of the estimated first year compensation for the position to be filled 
in addition  if the actual compensation of a placed candidate exceeds the estimated compensation  we often will be authorized to bill the client for one third of the excess 
indirect expenses are calculated as a percentage of the retainer with certain dollar limits per search 
historical perspective during and  the executive search industry experienced a dramatic increase in demand for its services in virtually all markets based on increased competition for executive talent  the need for executives with diverse and global leadership skills  and the proliferation of internet and e commerce businesses 
our rate of growth in net revenue during this period exceeded both the industry trend and our historical average because of the need for management at start up companies  the creation of new e commerce positions at more established companies and the growth in the financial services industry 
we responded to these trends by increasing the number of consultants and the number of offices from which we served our clients 
in  we added more than consultants  including consultants experienced in executive search and employees from other disciplines who were new to the search profession  in anticipation of a continuation of increased demand 
also  in response to the demand for internet enhanced mid level search  in march  we launched our mid level recruiting business as a separate subsidiary called leadersonline 

table of contents the slowdown in the united states economy that began early in  especially in the financial services and technology sectors  followed by a slowdown in other geographic markets  created an environment where the previous trends began to reverse 
commencing in june  when we anticipated a decrease in net revenue compared to  we took steps to reduce our cost base by reducing our workforce while retaining capacity to meet additional demand when the economy recovered 
in october  we announced further reductions in our workforce and consolidated or eliminated office space 
the initiatives related to these announcements  including the integration of leadersonline into our executive search business  were completed during the first quarter 
in  the worldwide economies  and the demand for executive search services  continued to weaken 
even after taking into account the workforce reductions and office consolidations and closings that occurred since june  at the then current and anticipated net revenue levels  we determined that we had substantial excess search team capacity 
in addition  the cost structure in europe continued to be too high for its net revenue level 
as a result  in october  we announced further reductions in our workforce and additional office consolidations and closings 
overview in  continued global economic weakness and geopolitical tensions adversely impacted the business environment and  consequently  the demand for our services 
net revenue in was million  a decrease of  from million in  as a soft economy for much of the year adversely affected our results 
excluding the positive impact of exchange rate changes  net revenue decreased approximately in compared to this year also saw changes in our company s senior management with the resignations of our chief executive officer  mr 
piers marmion  our president and chief operating officer  mr 
david anderson and our chief financial officer  mr 
kevin j 
smith 
we recorded charges of million for these separations 
in addition to these separation charges  we recorded million of other severance expense  primarily in europe and north america 
during  we recorded restructuring charges of million  consisting of million of severance expense  primarily in europe  million of expense for goodwill and other intangible asset impairment  primarily related to a wholly owned subsidiary in finland which is expected to be converted to a licensee  and million of expense to increase accruals for unused office space  reflecting the expectation of longer vacancy periods due primarily to weakness in the real estate markets in which the leased properties are located 
due to these restructuring charges  we did not expect to achieve certain long term profitability targets established in and therefore reversed million of accruals related to our performance share program that had been recorded as of december  our income tax provision includes a non cash income tax expense of million  recorded in the fourth quarter of  to provide a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets for the us and foreign operations which comprise the us income tax entity 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we considered all positive and negative evidence  including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  tax planning strategies  projected future taxable income and recent financial performance 
in  and  we reported net losses  primarily due to restructuring activities necessary to align our cost structure with expected net revenue levels 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  states that forming a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed is difficult when there is negative evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years 
based upon the provisions of sfas no 
 we recorded a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 

table of contents despite these significant expenses recorded in and the decline in net revenue  we believe that our cost structure is better aligned with anticipated net revenue levels  primarily as a result of the restructuring and cost reduction initiatives which have occurred over the past three years 
we ended the year with a cash balance of million  an increase of million  compared to million at december  also  in december  we secured a million revolving credit facility 
outlook for  we currently anticipate that net revenue will grow at a rate in the mid single digits 
this performance assumes that the worldwide economy will continue to strengthen 
at that level of net revenue growth  we would expect to generate operating margins in the percent to percent range 
we receive warrants for equity securities in our client companies  in addition to our cash fee  for services rendered on some searches 
upon a value event such as an initial public offering or an acquisition  the equity securities arising from the exercise of the warrants are monetized  resulting in a realized gain  net of the consultants share of the gain and other costs 
in  and  we recorded realized gains  net of the consultants share of the gain and other costs  of million  million  million  respectively  related to the equity and warrant portfolio 
with improvements in economic conditions  it is possible  although not certain  that we could realize gains which are significant to our reported earnings in the future 
results of operations we operate our executive search and complementary leadership services in four geographic regions north america  which includes the united states except miami and canada  latin america  which includes mexico and the rest of latin america  as well as miami  which serves as our gateway office to the region  europe  and asia pacific 
total revenue consists of revenue before reimbursements of out of pocket expenses net revenue and reimbursements of out of pocket expenses 
net revenue consists primarily of retainers and indirect expenses billed to clients 
reimbursements of out of pocket expenses are characterized as revenue in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred 
related reimbursable expenses are also shown separately within operating expenses 
for segment purposes  the reimbursements of out of pocket expenses are reported on a separate line  and therefore do not affect the analysis of net revenue by geographic region 
the presentation required by eitf issue no 
has no impact on the consolidated operating income loss or on the operating income loss of the geographic regions 
we believe that analyzing trends in net revenue and analyzing operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue more appropriately reflects our core operations

interest income in was approximately million compared to million in the decline is primarily due to lower returns on invested cash balances 
we receive warrants for equity securities in our client companies  in addition to our cash fee  for services rendered on some searches 
the warrants are recorded at fair value 
some of the warrants in our portfolio meet the definition of a derivative instrument under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and its subsequent amendments

the write down of the long term investment of million in resulted from the write down of the remainder of our investment in etf group 
etf group is a europe based venture capital firm that helps emerging companies expand into international markets 
net other non operating expense was million in compared to million in other non operating expense consists primarily of exchange gains and losses on intercompany balances which are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency and which are not considered permanent in nature 
income taxes 
in  we had a pre tax loss of million and recorded income tax expense of million 
the income tax provision includes a non cash income tax expense of million  recorded in the fourth quarter of  to provide a full valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets for the us and foreign operations which comprise the us income tax entity 
judgment is required in developing our income tax provision  including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances that might be required against the deferred tax assets 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we considered all positive and negative evidence  including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  tax planning strategies  projected future taxable income and recent financial performance 
in  and  we reported net losses  primarily due to restructuring activities necessary to align our cost structure with expected net revenue levels 
sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  states that forming a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed is difficult when there is negative evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years 
based upon the provisions of sfas no 
 we recorded  in the fourth quarter of  a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
the income tax expense recorded in also includes an expense of million  recorded in the first half of  to reduce certain deferred tax assets  representing the excess of expense for accounting purposes over the deduction for tax purposes  required to be recorded upon the vesting of restricted stock units 
in prior years  a portion of executive search consultant and management compensation was granted in restricted stock units at the then average market price of approximately per share 
this price served as the basis for the compensation expense and the related tax benefit and deferred tax asset 
the restricted stock units vested in at an average market price of approximately per share 
as this share price serves as the basis for the current tax deduction  we will realize a smaller tax benefit than initially recorded 
accordingly  we adjusted the deferred tax asset to reflect the lower tax benefit 
in  we had a pre tax loss of million and an income tax benefit of million 
the effective tax benefit rate in was  reflecting valuation allowances related to the recoverability of foreign tax credits  foreign net operating losses and other tax related allowances 
in addition  the income tax benefit in is reduced by approximately million of additional provision for income taxes in certain latin american subsidiaries 
the income tax provision and related current and deferred tax balances are more fully described in note  income taxes  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we anticipate that the effective tax rate will continue to fluctuate in the future due to the mix of earnings and profits in the jurisdictions in which we operate 
in  we anticipate that we will generate a loss for us income tax purposes  due primarily to the timing of tax deductions related to our restructuring charges  and 
table of contents therefore do not anticipate recording or paying any us income tax in we will however continue to record and pay income tax expense for certain of our foreign operations 
while the company expects to be profitable in and beyond  there is no assurance that future taxable income will be sufficient to realize the benefit of the deferred tax assets 
if after future assessments of the realizability of the deferred tax assets  we determine a lesser allowance is required  we would record a reduction to the income tax expense and the valuation allowance in the period of such determination 
compared to total revenue

we believe information regarding changes in net revenue excluding the impact of exchange rate fluctuations is helpful in providing an understanding of the volume of business activity 
the decline was due to decreased demand for our executive search services across most industries and disciplines  especially in our technology and financial services practices 
the number of confirmed executive searches decreased from we believe this decrease reflects the impact of the global economic slowdown

salaries and employee benefits 
consolidated salaries and employee benefits expense decreased million  or  to million in from million in the decrease was primarily attributable to million of lower accruals for performance based compensation  related in part to the lower net revenue  and million of lower fixed costs as a result of the elimination of more than  positions  or approximately of our workforce  since june as a percentage of net revenue  salaries and employee benefits expense increased to in from in this increase as a percentage of net revenue was primarily due to the impact of lower net revenue against our fixed salaries and employee benefits expense  partially offset by a lower percentage of net revenue being accrued for performance based compensation for executive search consultants  management and support staff

liquidity and capital resources general 
we continually evaluate our liquidity requirements  capital needs and availability of capital resources based on our operating needs 
we believe that our existing cash balances together with the funds expected to be generated from operations and funds available under our committed line of credit will be sufficient to finance our operations for the foreseeable future  as well as to finance the cash payments associated with our restructuring charges 
we historically have paid a portion of our bonuses in december and the remainder in march 
employee bonuses are accrued throughout the year and are based on our performance and the performance of the individual employee 
our ability to undertake acquisitions may depend  in part  on access to additional funds 
we do not have material off balance sheet arrangements  special purpose entities  trading activities of non exchange traded contracts  or transactions with related parties except as related to our investment in svic  which we wrote down  in its entirety  by december  see note  investments  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
some deferred compensation arrangements with certain employees  which were executed prior to july   are structured as forgivable loans 
the forgivable loans are accounted for as deferred compensation  and are therefore amortized to compensation expense over the forgiveness period 
at december   we had million of deferred compensation structured as forgivable loans 
the terms of a deferred compensation

lines of credit 
during and  we had a million committed revolving credit facility 
this facility was amended on april   november  and march   and would have expired on december  we paid a facility fee even if no portion of the line of credit was used 
in addition  in february  we entered into an uncommitted line of credit for million 
there were no financial covenants or fees related to this unsecured line of credit 
in december  we terminated the million uncommitted line of credit and replaced our million committed revolving credit facility with a new million committed revolving credit facility the facility 
under this facility  we may borrow us dollars  euros  sterling and other major traded currencies  as agreed by the banks 
borrowings under the facility bear interest at the existing alternate base rate or libor plus a margin as determined by our compliance with certain tests of our financial condition 
the facility has financial tests we must meet or exceed relating to fixed charge coverage defined as consolidated ebitdar minus consolidated capital expenditures to consolidated interest expense plus consolidated rental payments plus restricted payments 
ebitdar is defined as earnings before interest expense  taxes  depreciation  amortization and rental payments plus interest income  leverage defined as consolidated total indebtedness to consolidated ebitda plus interest income  current ratio defined as current assets divided by current liabilities  and net worth 
the facility sets limits on our ability to make acquisitions without bank approval and to incur additional debt outside of the facility 
we must pay a facility fee whether or not the facility is used during the year 
in march we amended the facility amendment no 
to reduce the net worth covenant from million to million 
this amendment was required as a result of the non cash income tax expense of million  recorded in the fourth quarter of  which provided a full valuation allowance for the net deferred tax assets related to the us and foreign operations which comprise the us income tax entity 
see note  income taxes  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
there were no borrowings outstanding under the lines of credit at december  or december   nor were there any borrowings during the years ended december  and  respectively

 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
represents obligations for separation payments related to the resignations of our former chief executive officer  the former president and chief operating officer  and our chief financial officer 
in addition to the contractual obligations included in the above table  we have liabilities related to certain employee benefit plans 
these liabilities are recorded in our consolidated balance sheet at december  the obligations related to these employee benefit plans are described in note  employee benefit plans  and note  pension plan and life insurance contract 
as the timing of cash disbursements related to these employee benefit plans is uncertain  we have not included these obligations in the above table 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates general 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note  summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
if actual amounts are ultimately different from previous estimates  the revisions are included in our results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact the financial statements 
management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect its more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
table of contents revenue recognition 
revenue before reimbursements for out of pocket expenses net revenue is recognized when earned and realizable and therefore when the following criteria have been met a persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  b services have been rendered  c the fee to our client is fixed or determinable  and d collectibility is reasonably assured 
net revenue consists of retainers and indirect expenses billed to clients 
typically  we are paid a retainer for our executive search services equal to approximately one third of the estimated first year compensation of the position to be filled 
if actual compensation of the placed candidate exceeds the estimated compensation  we are generally authorized to bill the client for one third of the excess 
net revenue from executive search engagements is recognized over the expected average period of performance  in proportion to the estimated personnel time incurred to fulfill our obligations under the arrangements 
net revenue in excess of the retainer  resulting from actual compensation of the placed candidate exceeding estimated compensation  is recognized upon completion of the executive search when the amount of the additional fee is known 
our assumptions about the duration of the time and extent of efforts for search teams to complete our services in an executive search engagement require significant judgment as these variables have fluctuated in the past and are expected to continue to do so 
accruals related to the consolidation and closing of offices recorded as part of our restructuring charges 
in october  october  october and june  we announced cost reduction initiatives to better align costs with expected revenue levels 
these initiatives included the consolidation and closing of offices where we had long term leases 
at the time of the office closings and consolidations  we accrued the estimated costs associated with these actions 
for initiatives which were announced prior to january   the accruals were established in accordance with eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring  and staff accounting bulletin no 
 restructuring and impairment charges 
for cost reduction initiatives announced in the fourth quarter of  the accruals were established in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
inherent in these accruals are estimates concerning vacancy periods  expected sublease income  and costs to terminate the leases 
these accruals are periodically updated to reflect information concerning the commercial real estate markets in which the offices are located 
during  we recorded million of restructuring charges to increase accruals for leased properties that had been identified as excess in previous office consolidation charges 
the accruals for excess real estate were increased to reflect the expectation of longer vacancy periods due primarily to weakness in the real estate markets in which the leased properties are located 
we believe that the accounting estimate related to accruals for the consolidation and closing of offices is a critical accounting estimate because it is highly susceptible to changes in the commercial real estate markets and the local regional economic factors where this leased office space is located 
income taxes 
deferred taxes are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
judgment is required in developing our income tax provision  including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances that might be required against the deferred tax assets 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we consider all positive and negative evidence  including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  tax planning strategies  projected future taxable income and recent financial performance 
we reported net losses in  and  primarily as a result of recording restructuring charges in connection with aligning our cost structure with expected net revenue levels 
sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  states that forming a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed is difficult when there is negative evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years 
based upon the provisions of sfas no 
 we recorded  in the fourth quarter of  a non cash income tax expense of million  
table of contents providing a full valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets for the us and foreign operations which comprise the us income tax entity 
while we expect to be profitable in and beyond  there is no assurance that there will be sufficient future taxable income to realize the benefit of the deferred tax assets 
if after future assessments of the realizability of the deferred tax assets  we determine a lesser allowance is required  we would record a reduction to the income tax expense and the valuation allowance in the period of such determination 
in  we anticipate that we will generate a loss for us income tax purposes  due primarily to the timing of tax deductions related to our restructuring charges  and therefore do not anticipate recording any income tax expense or paying any us income tax in we will however continue to record income tax expense and to pay income taxes for certain of our foreign operations 
we believe that the accounting estimate related to our income tax provision  deferred tax assets and liabilities and income taxes payable and recoverable is a critical accounting estimate because it is highly susceptible to our ability to generate taxable income in future years and to adequately provide for potential income tax related liabilities 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
we review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the provisions of sfas no 
require that a two step impairment test be performed on goodwill 
in the first step  we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value 
our reporting units are consistent with the reportable segments identified in note  segment information  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we determine the fair value of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow methodology with the assistance of an independent valuation firm 
under this approach  we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit  goodwill is not impaired and we are not required to perform further testing 
if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  then we must perform the second step in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill and compare it to the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then we must record an impairment loss equal to the difference 
the discounted cash flow approach  which we use to estimate the fair value of our reporting units  is dependent on a number of factors including estimates of future market growth and trends  forecasted revenue and costs  capital investments  appropriate discount rates  certain assumptions to allocate shared assets and liabilities  and other variables to calculate the carrying values for each of our reporting units 
we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable  but which are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
actual future results may differ from those estimates 
these assumptions are updated annually  at a minimum  to reflect information concerning our reportable segments 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  long lived assets  such as property  equipment  and purchased intangibles subject to amortization  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge  equal to the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset  is recognized 
we believe that the accounting estimate related to goodwill and other intangible asset impairment is a critical accounting estimate because the assumptions used are highly susceptible to changes in the operating results and cash flows of our reportable segments 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
accounts receivable from our customers are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is our best estimate of the amount of 
table of contents probable credit losses in existing accounts receivable balances 
we determine the allowance for doubtful accounts through an analysis of several factors  including the aging of our accounts receivable  historical write off experience  and specific account analyses 
we consider current and projected economic conditions and historical trends when determining the allowance for doubtful accounts 
actual collections of accounts receivable could differ from our estimates due to changes in future economic or industry conditions or specific customers financial condition

in  and  we recorded realized gains  net of the consultants share of the gain and other costs  of million  million  million  respectively  related to the equity and warrant portfolio 
with improvements in economic conditions  it is possible  although not certain  that we could realize gains which are significant to our reported earnings in the future 
currency market risk 
with our operations primarily in north america  latin america  europe and asia pacific we conduct business using various currencies 
revenue earned in each country is generally matched with the associated expenses incurred  thereby reducing currency risk to earnings 
however  because certain assets and liabilities are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  changes in currency rates may cause fluctuations in the valuation of such assets and liabilities 
as the local currency of our subsidiaries has been designated as the functional currency  we are affected by the translation of foreign currency financial statements into us dollars 
outside of north america  europe is our largest region in terms of net revenue 
a change in the average exchange rate of the british pound and the euro would have increased or decreased our net loss by approximately million
