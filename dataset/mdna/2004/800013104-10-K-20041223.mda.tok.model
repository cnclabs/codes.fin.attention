table of contents on january   the company announced a three for two stock split to be effected as a stock dividend

the company s capital budget for fiscal is approximately million  and will be funded by cash on hand  internally generated working capital and cash flows from operations 
if needed  the company has a million revolving line of credit available 
the million fiscal capital budget includes approximately million in operating leases  million to construct a new corporate office building  and million on the new poultry complex in south georgia 
without operating leases  the new office building and the georgia complex  the company s capital budget for fiscal would be a maintenance level budget of approximately million 
on may   the company entered into an amendment to its revolving credit facility 
the amendment  among other things  increased allowed capital expenditures to allow for the construction of the georgia complex  changed the net worth covenant to reflect the company s new dividend rate  extended the committed revolver by five years rather than the usual three year extension  reduced the interest rate charged on amounts outstanding  and removed a letter of credit commitment related to certain industrial development bonds 
on april   the company gave notice to us bank national association  as trustee under the indenture of trust dated as of november  related to the robinson county industrial development corporation variable rate demand industrial development revenue bonds sanderson farms  inc project series bonds  of the company s intent to exercise its right to call all of the bonds for optional redemption on june  the redemption date at a redemption price of of the principal amount of the bonds plus accrued interest to the redemption date 
the trustee redeemed the bonds on june  the company regularly evaluates both internal and external growth opportunities  including acquisition opportunities and the possible construction of new production assets  and conducts due diligence activities in connection with such opportunities 
the cost and terms of any financing to be raised in conjunction with any growth opportunity  including the company s ability to raise debt or equity capital on terms and at costs satisfactory to the company  and the effect of such opportunities on the company s balance sheet  are critical considerations in any such evaluation 
contractual obligations obligations under long term debt  long term capital leases  non cancelable operating leases  purchase obligations relating to feed grains  other feed ingredients and packaging supplies and claims payable relating to the company s workers compensation insurance policy at october  were as follows in thousands payments due by period more than contractual obligations total less than year years years years long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases purchase obligations claims payable total critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting standards generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions  and the differences could be material 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts in the normal course of business  the company extends credit to its customers on a short term basis 
although credit risks associated with our customers are considered minimal  the company routinely reviews its accounts receivable balances and makes provisions for probable doubtful accounts based on an individual assessment of a customer s credit quality as well as subjective factors and trends  including the aging of receivable balances 
in circumstances where management is aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to the company  a specific reserve is recorded to reduce the receivable to the amount expected to be collected 
if circumstances change ie  higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to us  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due us could be reduced by a material amount  and the allowance for doubtful accounts and related bad debt expense would increase by the same amount 
inventories processed food and poultry inventories and inventories of feed  eggs  medication and packaging supplies are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
if market prices for poultry or feed grains move substantially lower  the company would record adjustments to write down the carrying values of processed poultry and feed inventories to fair market value  which would increase the company s costs of sales 
live poultry inventories of broilers are stated at the lower of cost or market and breeders at cost less accumulated amortization 
the cost associated with broiler inventories  consisting principally of chicks  feed  medicine and payments to the growers who raise the chicks for us  are accumulated during the growing period 
the cost associated with breeder inventories  consisting principally of breeder chicks  feed  medicine and grower payments are accumulated during the growing period 
capitalized breeder costs are then amortized over nine months using the straight line method 
mortality of broilers and breeders is charged to cost of sales as incurred 
if market prices for chicks  feed or medicine or if grower payments increase or decrease during the period  the company could have an increase or decrease in the market value of its inventory as well as an increase or decrease in costs of sales 
should the company decide that the nine month amortization period used to amortize the breeder costs is no longer appropriate as a result of operational changes  a shorter or longer amortization period could increase or decrease the costs of sales recorded in future periods 
high mortality from disease or extreme temperatures would result in abnormal charges to cost of sales to write down live poultry inventories 
long lived assets depreciable long lived assets are primarily comprised of buildings and machinery and equipment 
depreciation is provided by the straight line method over the estimated useful lives  which are to years for buildings and to years for machinery and equipment 
an increase or decrease in the estimated useful lives would result in changes to depreciation expense 
the company continually reevaluates the carrying value of its long lived assets for events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
as part of this reevaluation  the company estimates the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposal 
if the sum of the expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying amount of the asset  an impairment loss is recognized to reduce the carrying value of the long lived asset to the estimated fair value of the asset 
if the company s assumptions with respect to the future expected cash flows associated with the use of long lived assets currently recorded change  then the company s determination that no impairment charges are necessary may change and result in the company recording an impairment charge in a future period 
accrued self insurance insurance expense for workers compensation benefits and employee related health care benefits are estimated using historical experience and actuarial estimates 
stop loss coverage is maintained with third party insurers to limit the company s total exposure 
management regularly reviews the assumptions used to recognize periodic expenses 
if historical experience proves not to be a good indicator of future expenses  if management were to use different actuarial assumptions  or if there is a negative trend in the company s claims history  there could be a significant increase or decrease in cost of sales depending on whether these expenses increased or decreased  respectively 

table of contents income taxes the company determines its effective tax rate by estimating its permanent differences resulting from differing treatment of items for financial and income tax purposes 
the company is periodically audited by taxing authorities and considers any adjustments made as a result of the audits in computing the company s income tax expense 
any audit adjustments affecting permanent differences could have an impact on the company s effective tax rate 
the recently passed american jobs creation act of represents far reaching legislation that will have a significant impact on many us taxpayers 
among other things  the act will provide a deduction with respect to income of certain us manufacturing activities and allow for favorable taxing on repatriation of offshore earnings 
although the provisions of the act do not impact the fiscal year financial statements under current accounting rules  the act will likely impact the company s financial statements in future periods 
we are currently evaluating the financial impact of this act 
contingencies the company is a party to a number of legal proceedings and recognizes the costs of legal defense in the periods incurred 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these matters is made after considerable analysis of each individual case 
at this time  the company has not accrued any reserve for any of these matters 
further reserves may be required due to changes in the company s assumptions  the effectiveness of legal strategies  or other factors beyond the company s control 
future results of operations may be materially affected by the creation of or changes to reserves 
new accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
interpretation no 
requires consolidation of entities when an enterprise absorbs a majority of the entity s expected losses  receives a majority of the entity s expected residual returns  or both  as a result of ownership  contractual or other financial interests in the entity 
currently  entities are generally consolidated by an enterprise when it has a controlling financial interest through ownership of a majority voting interest in the entity 
the consolidation requirements of this pronouncement were effective for the first reporting period ending after march  the company does not absorb losses or enjoy returns from any entity other than its subsidiaries  all of which are wholly owned and consolidated with the company  except for the company s less than interest in a company that processes and markets spent hens 
the investment in this company is million and it is not considered to be a variable interest entity 
therefore the adoption of fin had no impact on the company

in addition to including numerous other provisions that have potential effects on an employer s retiree health plan  the medicare law included a special subsidy for employers that sponsor retiree health plans with prescription drug benefits that are at least as favorable as the new medicare part d benefit

will have on the results of operations  financial position or cash flows 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company is a purchaser of certain commodities  primarily corn and soybean meal  for use in manufacturing feed for its chickens 
as a result  the company s earnings are affected by changes in the price and availability of such feed ingredients 
feed grains are subject to volatile price changes caused by factors described below that include weather  size of harvest  transportation and storage costs and the agricultural policies of the united states and foreign governments 
the price fluctuations of feed grains have a direct and material effect on the company s profitability 
generally  the company purchases its corn  soybean meal and other feed ingredients for prompt delivery to its feed mills at market prices at the time of such purchases 
the company sometimes will purchase feed ingredients for deferred delivery that typically ranges from one month to six months after the time of purchase 
the grain purchases are made directly with our usual grain suppliers  which are companies in the regular business of supplying grain to end users  and do not involve options to purchase 
such purchases occur when senior management concludes that market factors indicate that prices at the time the grain is needed are likely to be higher than current prices  or where  based on current and expected market prices for the company s poultry products  management believes it can purchase feed ingredients at prices that will allow the company to earn a reasonable return for its shareholders 
market factors considered by management in determining whether or not and to what extent to buy grain for deferred delivery include current market prices  current and predicted weather patterns in the united states  south america  china and other grain producing areas  as such weather patterns might affect the planting  growing  harvesting and yield of feed grains  the expected size of the harvest of feed grains in the united states and other grain producing areas of the world as reported by governmental and private sources  current and expected changes to the agricultural policies of the united states and foreign governments  the relative strength of united states currency and expected changes therein as it might impact the ability of foreign countries to buy united states feed grain commodities  the current and expected volumes of export of feed grain commodities as reported by governmental and private sources  the current and expected use of available feed grains for uses other than as livestock feed grains such as the use of corn for the production of ethanol  which use is impacted by the price of crude oil  and current and expected market prices for the company s poultry products 
the company purchases physical grain  not financial instruments such as puts  calls or straddles that derive their value from the value of physical grain 
thus  the company does not use derivative financial instruments as defined by sfas  accounting for derivatives for instruments and hedging activities 
the company does not enter into any derivative transactions or purchase any grain related contracts other than the physical grain contracts described above 
the cost of feed grains is recognized in cost of sales  on a first in first out basis  at the same time that the sales of the chickens that consume the feed grains are recognized
