item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations herein 
the company does not report its finances by segment  as the company s principal business line is the design  manufacture  and sale of stereo headphones and related accessories 
the percentage of total revenues related to this central business line over the past three fiscal years was stereophones the company s products are sold through audio specialty stores  the internet  direct mail catalogs  regional department store chains  discount department stores  military exchanges  prisons  and national retailers under the koss name and dual label 
the company also sells products to distributors for resale to school systems  and directly to other manufactures for inclusion with their own products 
the company has more than  domestic dealers and its products are carried in approximately  domestic retail outlets 
international markets are served by domestic sales representatives and a sales office in switzerland which utilizes independent distributors in several foreign countries 
in may of  the company purchased the assets of addax sound  a company that specializes in the development of communications headsets 
addax is principally a design and source operation utilizing contract manufacturers in asia 
the assets of addax included inventory  receivables  tooling  furniture and fixtures as well as patents on designs for telecommunications products 
addax has been renamed bi audio and services the public safety market through distributors 
bi audio develops and sells headsets and microphones for communication via two way radio by police  fire  and security personnel 
bi audio also sells a line of telephone headsets for the small office and home office as well as for the call center industry 
these products are developed on an original equipment manufacturer oem basis and are sold to other companies for distribution at retail or direct to consumers 
bi audio also markets headsets to be used with cellular telephones and cordless home telephones 
these products are developed on an oem basis for sale to other companies who redistribute the products through retail channels or direct to consumers 
the bi audio category of products represents less than of the company s total revenue and is further split into products for three categories public safety  call center  and cellular telephone 
ninety five percent of the company s products are stereo headphones for listening to music 
the products are not significantly differentiated by channel or application with the exception of products sold to school systems  which sometimes include a microphone 
sales in this channel represent less than of the company s revenue 
there are no other product line differentiations other than the quality of the sound produced by the stereo headphone itself  which is highly subjective 
therefore any remaining classification of the business 
table of contents would be by distribution channel 
consumers purchase more than of the koss stereophone range of product through some form of retail channel or reseller 
the company maintains a sales office in switzerland 
the company sells its products to independent distributors in countries outside the united states  see foreign sales section below including western and eastern europe  scandinavia  the middle east  africa  asia  south america  latin america  the caribbean  and mexico 
the company sells products in the canadian market directly to retailers  and also through a distributor who services smaller specialty accounts 
during the last three fiscal years  foreign sales of all koss products  including the products of bi audio since its acquisition  were as follows percentage of revenue derived from the export of koss products management believes that it has sources of raw materials that are adequate for its needs 
no employment or compensation agreement exists between the company and its dealers 
the company has two independent manufacturer s representatives for distribution 
the company typically signs one year contracts with these manufacturer s representatives 
these agreements are seldom renewed in writing 
the company recently entered into a manufacturer s representative agreement with a firm in detroit to work exclusively in the automotive arena 
the sales from these agreements account for approximately of the company s total revenue in the automotive representative is paid for all business in this area until  until  until  and thereafter 
any remaining agreements with distributors  past or present  pertain to geographic countries without compensation attached 
the company has the right to terminate these agreements with foreign distributors at will 
intellectual property john koss has been recognized for creating the stereophone industry with the first sp stereophone in the company regularly applies for registration of its trademarks in many countries around the world in which it does business  and over the years the company has had numerous trademarks registered and patents issued in countries in north america  south america  asia  europe  africa  and australia 
the company currently has trademarks registered in countries around the world and patents in countries 
the company has trademarks to protect the brand name koss and its logotype on its products 
these trademarks are maintained throughout the countries in which the company sells its products 
the company also holds many design patents that protect the unique visual appearance of some of its products 
these trademarks and patents are important to differentiate the company from its competitors 
certain of the company s trademarks are of material value and importance to the conduct of its business 
the company considers protection of its proprietary developments important  however  the company s business is not  in the opinion of management  materially dependent upon any single trademark or patent 
see part ii  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations herein for information relating to the company s license agreements 
seasonality although retail sales of consumer electronics have been historically higher during the holiday season  stereophones have also seen increased interest as gift items over the years 
management of the company is of the opinion that its business and industry segment are no longer seasonal as evidenced by the fact that of 
table of contents sales occurred in the first six months of the fiscal year ended june   and of sales occurred in the latter six months of that fiscal year 
management believes that the reason for this level performance of sales to retailers is related to the fact that stereo headphones have become replacement items for portable electronic products 
therefore upgrades and replacements appear to have as much interest over the course of the year as gifts of stereophones 
working capital and backlog the company s working capital needs do not differ substantially from those of its competitors in the industry and generally reflect the need to carry significant amounts of inventory to meet delivery requirements of its customers 
from time to time  although rarely  the company may extend payment terms to its dealers for a special promotion 
for instance  the company has in the past offered a day payment period for certain customers  such as computer retailers and office supply stores 
based on historical trends  management does not expect these practices to have any material effect on net sales or net income 
the company s current backlog of orders is not material in relation to annual net sales and was not material in relation to net sales during fiscal customers the company markets a line of products used by consumers to listen to music 
the company distributes these products through retail channels in the us and independent distributors throughout the rest of the world 
the company markets its products to approximately  customers worldwide 
during  the company s sales to its largest single customer  wal mart stores inc  were approximately of total gross sales 
the company is dependent upon its ability to retain an existing base of customers to sell the company s line of products 
loss of customers means loss of product placement 
the company has broad distribution across many channels including specialty stores  mass merchants  electronics stores  and computer retailers 
since distribution is broadly based  any loss of a customer directly translates into a reduction in sales volume which can only be replaced by replacing a similar number of representative retail outlets 
for example  the loss of a customer representing of the company s business would translate into a reduction in revenues of up to based upon the point through the fiscal year that the customer was lost 
attracting a new customer during the course of a fiscal year could have a positive impact or simply replace an account which had previously been lost 
in addition  a customer can decide to make a change in the models that it decides to offer for sale 
such changes can take place arbitrarily throughout the course of a year which can cause reductions in sales revenues in proportion to the number of retail outlets that the store represents in the market 
the company may not be able to maintain customers or model selections and therefore experience a reduction in its sales revenue until a model is restored to the mix or a customer is replaced by a new customer 
a reduction in sales volume would cause a reduction in profitability 
management believes that any loss of wal mart s revenues would be partially offset by a corresponding decrease  on a percentage basis  in expenses  thereby partially reducing the impact on the company s operating income 
the five largest customers of the company including wal mart accounted for approximately of total sales in competition the company has a single focus on the headphone industry 
the recent acquisition of addax  now bi audio  continues to emphasize the company s interest in all categories of headsets  headphones  and stereophones 
in the stereophone market  the company competes directly with approximately five major competitors  several of which are large and diversified and have greater total assets and resources than the company 
the company provides a single product focus to its customers that is unique in the marketplace 
the extent to which retailers view the company as an innovative vendor of high quality headphone products  and a provider of positive after sales customer service  is the extent to which the company will be considered competitive 
the company relies upon its unique sound  quality workmanship  brand identification  engineering skills  and customer service to maintain its competitive position 

table of contents research and development the amount spent on engineering and research activities relating to the development of new products or the improvement of existing products was  during fiscal as compared with  during fiscal and  during fiscal these activities were conducted by both company personnel and outside consultants 
environmental matters the company believes that it has materially complied with all currently existing federal  state and local statutes and regulations regarding environmental standards and occupational safety and health matters to which it is subject 
during fiscal  and  the amounts incurred in complying with federal  state and local statutes and regulations pertaining to environmental standards and occupational safety and health laws and regulations did not materially affect the company s earnings or financial condition 
employees as of june   the company employed people 
the company also utilizes temporary personnel to meet seasonal production demands 
foreign sales international markets are serviced through manufacturer s representatives or independent distributors with product produced in the united states 
the countries are too numerous to mention here but include countries in the following regions western and eastern europe  scandinavia  the middle east  africa  asia  south america  latin america  the caribbean  and mexico 
the company sells products in the canadian market directly to retailers  and also through a distributor who services smaller specialty accounts 
in the opinion of management  the company s competitive position and risks relating to the conduct of its business in such markets are comparable to the domestic market 
the company does note however  that the governments of foreign nations may elect to erect barriers to trade on imports 
the creation of such barriers would reduce the company s revenue and profit 
in addition  any fluctuations in currency exchange rates could affect the pricing of the company s products and cause customers to purchase lower priced  less profitable products 
for further information  see part ii  item and note to the consolidated financial statements accompanying this form k 
the company operates a small sales office in switzerland to service the international export marketplace 
the company is aware of no material risks in maintaining this operation 
loss of this office would result in a transfer of sales and marketing responsibility 
the company uses contract manufacturing facilities in the peoples republic of china  taiwan  and south korea 
these independent supplier entities are distant from the company  which means that we are at risk of business interruptions due to natural disaster  war  disease  and government intervention through tariffs or trade restrictions 
the company maintains finished goods inventory in its us facility to mitigate this risk 
the approximate level of finished goods inventory is stocked at an average of days demand per item 
recovery of a single facility through a replacement of supplier in the event of a disaster or suspension of supply could take days 
the company believes that it could restore production of its top twelve selling models which represent of the company s sales revenue within year 
the company is also at risk if the trade restrictions are introduced on its products based upon country of origin 
in addition  any increase in tariffs and freight charges would not be acceptable to pass along to the company s customers and would directly impact the company s profits

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
financial condition and liquidity during fiscal  cash provided by operations was  working capital was  at june  the net increase in working capital of  at june  represents primarily the net effect of an increase in cash  receivables  income taxes and accrued liabilities and decreases in accounts payable 
the increase in the company s accounts receivable is attributable to higher sales experienced in the last quarter 
capital expenditures for new property and equipment including production tooling were   and  in fiscal   and  respectively 
depreciation charges totaled   and  for the same fiscal years 
budgeted capital expenditures for fiscal are  the company expects to generate sufficient funds through operations to fund these expenditures 
stockholders investment increased to  at june  from  at june  the increase reflects net income of  and the effect of the change in accounting principle related to the adoption of statement of accounting standards sfas no 
 in connection with the stock repurchase agreement with the chairman of the company for more information  see the recently issued financial accounting pronouncements section below 
on june   the company declared a quarterly cash dividend of per share   payable on july  to stockholders of record on june   which is recorded as dividends payable 
the company s credit facility matures on november  this unsecured credit facility provides for borrowings up to a maximum of  the company can use this credit facility for working capital purposes or for the purchase of its own common stock pursuant to the company s stock repurchase program 
borrowings under this credit facility bear interest at the bank s prime rate  or libor plus 
this credit facility includes certain financial covenants that require the company to maintain a minimum tangible net worth and specified current  interest coverage  and leverage ratios 
the maximum leverage of the company  which consists of the ratio of its total liabilities to its tangible net worth  must not exceed to the tangible net worth of the company must not fall below million at any time 
the fixed charge ratio of the company  which consists of the ratio of its earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation  amortization  and other non cash charges to its total interest expense  must not be less than to the current ratio of the company  which is the ratio of its current assets to its current liabilities  must exceed to the company has been and is well within these requirements 
however  if the company at some point in the future fails to meet the financial covenants  the lender may accelerate the debt and allow creditors to foreclose on the assets 
the company uses its credit facility from time to time  although there was no utilization of this credit facility at june  or june  in april of  the board of directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing the company to purchase from time to time up to  of its common stock for its own account 
subsequently  the board of directors periodically has approved increases in the stock repurchase program 
the most recently approved increase was for additional purchases of  which occurred in july of  for an aggregate maximum of  the company intends to effect all stock purchases either on the open market or through privately negotiated transactions  and intends to finance all stock purchases through its own cash flow or by borrowing for such purchases 
the company will continue to repurchase its shares from the market when the board determines the shares to be undervalued 
the company may elect to use the purchase of these shares to minimize the dilutive effects to its stockholders when the company s stock is used in acquisitions as consideration 
the company has no immediate plans to make another acquisition at this time 
for fiscal  the company purchased  shares of its common stock at an average net price of per share  for a total purchase price of  as of the date hereof  the company s board of directors has authorized the repurchase by the company of up to  in company common stock at the discretion of the chief executive officer of the company 

table of contents from the commencement of the company s stock repurchase program through june   the company has purchased a total of  shares for a total gross purchase price of  representing an average gross purchase price of per share and a total net purchase price of  representing an average net purchase price of per share 
the difference between the total gross purchase price and the total net purchase price is the result of the company purchasing from certain employees shares of the company s stock acquired by such employees pursuant to the company s stock option program 
in determining the dollar amount available for additional purchases under the stock repurchase program  the company uses the total net purchase price paid by the company for all stock purchases  as authorized by the board of directors 
risk factors reduction in present levels of cash flow could adversely affect the company s business the company s primary source of liquidity over the past twelve months has been operating cash flows 
the company s future cash flows from operations on both a short term and long term basis are dependent upon  but not limited to the company s ability to attract new customers that will sell the company s products and pay for them  the company s ability to retain the company s existing customers at the level of sales previously produced  the volume of sales for these customers  the loss of business of one or more primary customers  changes in types of products that the customers purchase in their sales mix  the volume of royalty income paid to the company by its licensees based upon the terms of each royalty agreement  including the inability to negotiate favorable royalty arrangements and renew current arrangements with certain existing favorable terms  poor or deteriorating economic conditions which would directly impact the ability of the company s customers to remain in business and pay for their products on a timely basis  management s ability to hold the line on any requests for increases in material or labor cost increases  and the ability to collect in full and in a timely manner  amounts due to the company 
in addition  as noted above  the company s cash flow is also dependent  to some extent  upon the ability to maintain operating margins 
if there were a general downturn in economic conditions or other events that caused the company s customers to turn to lower priced  lower margin products  the company s cash flow and profitability could be materially and adversely affected 
failure to attract and retain customers to sell the company s products could adversely affect sales volume and future profitability the company markets a line of products used by consumers to listen to music 
the company distributes these products through retail channels in the us and independent distributors throughout the rest of the world 
the company is dependent upon the company s ability to retain an existing base of customers to sell the company s line of products 
loss of customers means loss of product placement 
the company has broad distribution 
table of contents across many channels including specialty stores  mass merchants  electronics stores and computer retailers 
since distribution is broadly based  any loss of a customer directly translates into a reduction in sales volume which can only be replaced by replacing a similar number of representative retail outlets 
the inability of the company s sales and marketing staff to obtain new distribution outlets translates into a lack of future growth and possibly a setback in sales volumes when loss of current customers occurs 
for example  the loss of a customer representing of the company s business would translate into a reduction in revenues of up to based upon the point through the fiscal year that the customer was lost 
attracting a new customer during the course of a fiscal year could have a positive impact or simply replace an account which has been lost 
in addition  a customer can decide to make a change in the models that it decides to offer for sale 
such changes can take place arbitrarily throughout the course of a year which can cause reductions in sales revenues in proportion to the number of retail outlets that the store represents in the market 
the company may not be able to maintain customers or model selections and therefore experience a reduction in its sales revenue until a model is restored to the mix or a customer is replaced by a new customer 
a reduction in sales volume would cause a reduction in profitability 
the company s failure to retain existing customers  obtain new customers or develop new product lines that customers would choose to offer to consumers could significantly affect the company s future profitability 
the loss of business of one or more principal customers or a change in the sales volume from a particular customer could have a material adverse effect on the company s sales volume and profitability 
shift in customer specifications to lower priced items can reduce profit margins negatively impacting profitability the company sells a line of products with a suggested retail price ranging from less than us to us  the gross margin for each of these models is unique in terms of percentages 
the price range of the products also produces a different level of actual dollar contribution per unit 
for example a product with a gross margin contribution of might yield a contribution for one item  while another item may feature a gross margin which could yield dollars 
the company finds the low priced portion of the market most competitive and therefore most subject to pressure on gross margin percentages  which tends to lower profit contributions 
retail preference for lower priced items can reduce profit margins and contributions 
the risk is that a shift in retail customer specifications toward lower priced items can lead to lower gross margins and lower profit contributions per unit of sale 
due to the range of products that the company sells  the product sales mix can produce a variation in terms of a range of profit margins 
some customers sell a limited range of products that yield lower profit margins than others 
most notably  the budget priced headphone segment of the market below retail which is distributed through computer stores  office supply stores  and mass market retailers tend to yield the lowest gross margins 
an increase in business with these types of accounts  when coupled with a simultaneous reduction in sales to customers with higher gross margins will reduce profit margins and profitability 
poor economic conditions can restrict or limit product placement  sales and replenishment which could decrease profits deteriorating or weak economic conditions  or a forecast for the same  can trigger changes in inventory stocking at retail 
this may in turn lead to a reduction in model offerings and to out of stock situations 
if a retail customer of the company does not have adequate stocks of the company s products to offer for sale in a retail store  consumers may choose another competitive model instead 
customers operating retail stores anticipate future sales demands and inventory products accordingly 
whenever a general economic slowdown occurs  at both the domestic or foreign level  sales volume levels and re orders change 
these changes directly impact the company s sales and profitability 
the company is not in a position to determine how it will be affected by these circumstances  how extensive the effects may be  or for how long the company may be impacted by these circumstances 
the company s customers respond to changes in economic conditions and any anticipated changes in economic conditions can therefore restrict product placement  availability  sales  replenishment and ultimately profitability 
these conditions exist domestically and internationally 

table of contents management is subject to decisions made outside its control which could directly affect future profitability retail customers determine which products they will stock for resale 
the company competes with other manufacturers to secure shelf space in retail stores for the company s products 
during the course of a year changes in the customers management personnel can ultimately lead to changes in the stock assortment offered to consumers 
these changes are often arbitrary 
the sales and marketing team cannot always overcome such decisions 
in addition to changes in personnel within the company s customers  it is also possible that a strategic decision can be made by a retail customer to consolidate vendors  or to discontinue certain product categories all together 
in these instances the company s management team may not able to overcome such decisions 
the company s management team is also engaged in the effective procurement  assembly  and manufacture of products 
the ability to negotiate with suppliers  maintain productivity  and hold the line on cost increases can be subjected to pressures outside the control of management 
for example  increases in fuel costs can increase rates of freight 
increases of this nature can seldom be avoided and the company may not be able to pass such increases along to its customers 
the company s management s effective control of the manufacturing processes will have a direct impact on the company s future profitability 
the company regularly makes decisions that affect production schedules  shipping schedules  employee level  and inventory levels 
the company s ability to make effective decisions in managing these areas has a direct effect on future profitability 
accounts receivable amounts due from our customers can be lost as a result of customer bankruptcy  operational difficulty  or failure to pay negatively impacting future profitability the company has significant accounts receivable or other amounts due from the company s customers or other parties 
the accounts receivable balance at the end of the last quarters averaged approximately us million 
terms of payment for customers generally range from cash in advance to net day credit terms 
these credit arrangements are negotiated at unspecified and irregular intervals 
the largest customers generate the largest receivable balances 
if a customer develops operational difficulty it is not uncommon to temporarily suspend payment to vendors 
the company is not immune from such practice in the retail marketplace 
from time to time a customer may develop severe operating losses which can lead to a bankruptcy 
in these cases  the company may lose most of the outstanding balance due 
occasionally the company has been current with a customer at the time such an event occurs 
the risk is that losing the revenue of the customer in the future after a restructuring  might be more onerous than losing the current outstanding accounts receivable 
in addition  many companies that will insure accounts receivables will not do so for the company s largest mass market customers 
the best example of such a loss was kmart corporation 
the company lost approximately  of which  has been repaid during when kmart filed for re organization 
kmart had been current with the company at the time that kmart filed chapter bankruptcy 
the company continued to supply kmart during its post petition re organization and continues to supply the customer profitably today 
the risk is that the company derives most of the company s sales revenue and profits from selling products to retailers for resale to consumers 
the failure of the company s customers to pay in full amounts due to the company could negatively affect future profitability 
company profits can suffer from interruptions in supply chain the company operates a small sales office in switzerland to service the international export marketplace 
the company is aware of no material risks in maintaining this operation 
loss of this office would result in a transfer of sales and marketing responsibility 
the company uses contract manufacturing facilities in mainland china  taiwan  and south korea 
these independent supplier entities are distant from the company which means that the company is at risk of business interruptions due to natural disaster  war  disease  and government intervention through tariffs or trade restrictions 
the company maintains a finished goods inventory level in the company s us facility to mitigate this risk 
the approximate level of finished goods inventory is stocked at an average of days demand per item 
recovery of a single facility through a replacement of supplier in the event of disaster or suspension of supply could take approximately days 
the company believes that it 
table of contents could restore production of its top twelve selling models which represent of the company s sales revenue within year 
the company is also at risk if trade restrictions are introduced on the company s products based upon country of origin 
in addition  any increase in tariffs and freight charges would not be acceptable to pass along to the company s customers and would directly impact the company s profits 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates could affect pricing of products and cause customers to purchase lower priced  less profitable products the company receives a material portion of its revenue and profits from business in canada and the european union 
to the extent that value of the us dollar increases relative to currencies in those jurisdictions  it increases the cost of the company s products in those jurisdictions  which could create negative pressure on the demand for the company s products 
to the extent that increased prices arising from currency fluctuations decreases the company s sales or moves customers to purchase lower priced  lower profit products  the company s revenues  profits  and cash flows could be adversely affected
