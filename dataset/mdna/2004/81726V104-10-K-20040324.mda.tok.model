item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management overview we are a holding company conducting business through two wholly owned operating subsidiaries  cell molecular technologies  inc cmt  and sentigen biosciences 
cmt provides contract research and development services and manufactures specialty cell culture media  reagents and other research products for companies engaged in the drug discovery process 
sentigen biosciences is primarily engaged in the development and commercialization of novel bioassay systems that elucidate the underlying biology of protein protein interactions 
sentigen biosciences is initially targeting its tango assay system to address the functionalization of g protein coupled receptors gpcrs for pharmaceutical drug discovery and development 
sentigen biosciences has filed patent applications on its assay system and expects to file additional patent applications on this technology in the future 
cmt operates through two divisions molecular cell science mcs and specialty media sm 
mcs provides contract research and development services and high throughput screening support services to companies engaged in the drug discovery process 
sm develops  manufactures and markets specialty cell culture media  reagents and other research products 
cmt and sentigen biosciences continue to execute their respective business plans and are focused on building their respective businesses to secure growth in the future 
at cmt  we are expending time and resources to broaden our customer base and our service offerings to the drug discovery community 
at sentigen biosciences  we are spending our time and resources to execute the development and commercialization of the tango assay system 
the earnings generated from our base business at cmt have  to date  provided us with the financial resources to execute our research program at sentigen biosciences 
our continued success in these efforts depends on cmt s ability to broaden its customer base and expand its portfolio of services to the drug discovery community 
to this end  the management team at cmt has spent its time developing its business through trade conferences  exhibition and project collaborations that demonstrate cmt s sophisticated service platform and research products to companies engaged in the drug discovery process 
sentigen biosciences has been primarily focused on research and development  and has participated in various scientific and industry conferences and met with leading pharmaceutical  biotechnology and agricultural companies in an effort to raise awareness of its technologies among constituents in those communities 
sentigen biosciences intends to seek strategic discovery and development partnerships around key molecular targets with biotechnology  pharmaceutical and other life sciences research institutions and although introductory meetings have begun  no assurance can be given that any such partnerships will be successfully entered into 
sentigen biosciences also intends to expand its research and development programs and we may  in the future  seek to obtain additional debt or equity financing to fund these expanded research and development programs 
critical accounting policies cell molecular technologies  inc management evaluates the performance of cmt through its two divisions both are treated as separate business segments 
revenue  income after direct costs also referred to as gross margin on revenues or gross margin and net income are used to measure and evaluate the financial results of cmt 
revenue recognition 
the mcs division s services are performed on a fee for service  fixed contract basis that provide for payments after specific research milestones are achieved 
revenues from the mcs division are recognized using the percentage of completion method for fixed price contracts extending over more than one accounting period 
work in process  representing time and costs incurred on projects in process in excess of amounts billed to customers  are recorded as unbilled services on our consolidated balance sheets 
unearned revenue represents amounts billed in excess of costs incurred and are recorded as liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 
revenues from the product sales of the sm division are recognized upon transfer of title and transfer of risk of loss to the product  which generally occurs upon shipment to the customer 
direct costs 
the major classes of direct costs for the mcs division are as follows costs incurred for direct materials used in the services performed under research contracts  an allocation of the compensation costs for the time incurred on such contracts by scientists  an allocation of indirect materials costs for general laboratory expenses incurred for the benefit of all contracts in process and an allocation of certain general and administrative expenses incurred by cmt 
the direct costs of the sm division represent the direct costs of research products sold  including an allocation of the compensation costs for production personnel  and an allocation of certain general and administrative expenses incurred by cmt 
the inventory of the sm division is determined using the fifo first in  first out method of accounting 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
the major classes of selling  general and administrative expenses incurred by cmt are as follows compensation and employee benefit costs of cmt s management  sales  and administrative staff  compensation and employee benefit costs for the time of scientific and production personnel spent on selling  general and administrative activities  facilities rental  utilities  communication costs and related operating expenses  marketing  sales and advertising costs  business travel expenses  commercial and product liability insurance costs  repairs and maintenance costs on facilities and laboratory equipment and professional fees for legal and accounting services 
sentigen biosciences the operations of sentigen biosciences are reflected as research and development expenses in our consolidated statements of operations 
sentigen biosciences operations  since its inception in february  consist entirely of research and development 
research and development costs are expensed as such costs are incurred 
on august   sentigen biosciences was awarded a federal phase i grant in the amount of  from the national institute of health 
the term of the grant was from september  through february  the grant provides for the direct costs of a specific project within sentigen biosciences overall research program budgeted in the grant for  as well as an allocation for the facilities and administrative costs of sentigen biosciences related to the project budgeted in the grant at 
sentigen biosciences completed the research project covered under the grant and all funds were received from the national institute of health as of december  the receipt of funds under the grant were accounted for as revenue  the direct costs of the project were accounted for as direct costs and the related facilities and administrative costs were shown as operating expenses in our consolidated statements of operations 
sentigen holding corp 
the expenses of the parent company  sentigen holding corp 
are reflected as corporate overhead expenses in our consolidated statements of operations and include the following major classes compensation and employee benefits cost for the chairman of the board  chief financial officer  executive vice president of commercial operations and administrative assistant  professional fees for legal and accounting services  office rental  utilities and communication costs  stock market listing fees and other related public company expenses and business travel expenses 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
management bases these estimates and assumptions upon historical experience and existing  known circumstances 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
specifically  management must make estimates in the following areas allowance for doubtful accounts 
our consolidated balance sheet includes a reserve against receivables for estimated losses that may result from customers inability to pay 
management determines the amount of the reserve by analyzing uncollectible accounts  aged receivables  and customers creditworthiness 
amounts later determined and specifically identified to be uncollectible are charged against this reserve 
to minimize the likelihood of uncollectible accounts  customers creditworthiness is reviewed periodically based on our experience with the customer and external credit services if necessary and adjusted accordingly 
should a customer s account become past due  a hold is generally placed on the account and further shipments or services are discontinued to that customer  minimizing further risk of loss 
additionally  all accounts with aged balances greater than one year are fully reserved 
inventory adjustments 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
management reviews the components of inventory on a regular basis for excess  obsolete and impaired inventory based on estimated future usage and sales 
stock levels generally do not exceed one quarter s expectation of usage or sales 
inventories were stated at  and no reserve for impairment or obsolescence was necessary as of december  impairment of intangibles 
our intangible assets consist primarily of license costs of  as of december   and are the result of the exclusive licensing agreement with the trustees of columbia university 
the value of the license reflects the closing share price of our common stock on april  the closing date of the agreement with the trustees of columbia university less accumulated amortization 
the value of the license is subject to an amortization period of years 
management reviews the value of the license for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be fully recoverable 
a review for impairment includes comparing the carrying value of the license to an estimate of the undiscounted net future cash inflows over the life of the license 
the license is considered to be impaired when the carrying value exceeds the calculation of the undiscounted net future cash inflows or fair market value 
an impairment loss in the amount of the excess would be recognized in our consolidated statements of operations if the carrying value exceeded the fair market value of the license 
we believe no such loss is necessary as of december revenue recognition 
revenues from the mcs division are recognized using the percentage of completion method for fixed price contracts 
percentage of completion is determined based on the proportion of completed costs to total anticipated costs on each contract 
management uses estimates of remaining costs to complete each contract to determine the revenue and profitability on each contract 
management reevaluates these estimates periodically and such reevaluations may  in the future  lead to changes in the rate of profitability on each contract 
there were no contracts where the expected costs exceeded the contract price 
all contract receivables are due within one year 
stock based compensation 
sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation  encourages  but does not require companies to record compensation cost for stock based employee compensation plans at fair value 
we continue to account for stock based compensation to employees using the intrinsic value method prescribed in accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
apb no 
requires no recognition of compensation expense for the stock based compensation arrangements provided that the exercise price is equal to the market price at the date of the grants 
options granted to non employees are valued at either the fair value of the consideration received  or the fair value of the equity instruments issued  whichever is more reliably measurable 
the expense for options issued to non employees is recorded as stock based compensation in our consolidated statements of operations 
the fair value of each option grant is estimated using the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes model requires management to estimate common stock price volatility  risk free interest rates and other parameters in order to determine the fair value of an option grant 
we also adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment of sfas no 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of regulation s k 
results of operations comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  revenues 
revenues for the year ended december  were  compared to revenue of  for the year ended december  this increase of  or  was the result of an increase of  or  in contract revenue from cmt s mcs division and an increase of  or  in revenue from cmt s sm division  offset  in part  by a decrease of  or in grant revenues from sentigen biosciences 
our consolidated revenues in were entirely attributable to the operations of cmt and its two divisions  mcs and sm 
an analysis of the revenues from the mcs division is as follows for the year ended december  percent change hts contract   all other contracts   total   the contract revenue for high throughput screening  or hts  services is derived from a retainer contract 
the contract provided for payments of  per month  regardless of the volume of services performed during the month 
the term of the contract was for one year and ended on december  the increase in the revenues received under the contract resulted from the increase in hts services required by the customer to support its hts programs during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  on january   this customer renewed its contract with cmt for a term of one year  ending on december  the new contract provides for payments to cmt of  per month in exchange for a fixed number of cell and reagent deliveries to support the customer s hts program 
should actual deliveries during exceed the fixed number of deliveries provided for in the contract additional deliveries will be billed at the rate of per delivery 
the contract also provides for a credit against other services in addition to the base contract value performed for the customer in should actual deliveries during fall below the fixed number of deliveries provided for in the contract 
the contract states that the credit against the value of future additional services performed in cannot exceed of the value of the additional services performed in addition to the base contract value for the growth from other contracts was driven by mouse genetics services and protein expression services 
revenues from the sm division grew for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  this growth was driven by three factors an increase in sales of the sm division s line of murine embryonic stem cells and feeder cells as well as media associated with this product line  increase in sales of the sm division s proprietary formulations sold under private label  and price increases implemented as of january  income after direct costs and gross margin 
income after direct costs for the year ended december  was  a gross margin on revenue of compared to income after direct costs of  a gross margin on revenue of for the year ended december  gross margin for the mcs division was for both the year ended december   and gross margin for the sm division was for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  the decrease was due to higher direct labor costs in the sm division 
operating expenses 
operating expenses for the year ended december  were  compared to  for the year ended december  this increase of  or was primarily the result of the following selling  general and administrative expenses of cmt increased  or due to higher commercial insurance expenses  higher compensation expenses and higher marketing and sales expenses 
research and development expenses increased  due to higher professional fees and research expenses at sentigen biosciences 
corporate overhead expenses increased  or 
the increase was primarily due to the increased costs associated with the hiring of our executive vice president of commercial operations and increased professional fees for legal services 
an increase in stock based compensation costs of  the increase in stock based compensation results from the september  amendment to a stock option agreement with our chairman of the board  chief executive officer and president 
the stock option is for the purchase of  shares of our common stock at per share and was originally granted on may  the stock option is fully vested and would have expired on april  the amendment extended the life of the option to april  all other terms of the stock option agreement remain unchanged 
as a result of this amendment and according to fasb interpretation no 
to apb opinion no 
we recognized stock based compensation in the amount of  these increases were partially offset by a decrease of  in depreciation and amortization expenses 
income loss from operations 
loss from operations for the year ended december  was  compared to a loss from operations of  for the year ended december  the components of this increase are as follows for the year ended december  percent change cmt   sentigen biosciences   holding company expenses   total   the increased income from operations of cmt was driven by its increase in revenues 
the revenue increase was augmented by reduced selling  general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenue 
the loss from operations attributable to sentigen biosciences increased due to higher research costs and professional fees 
the loss from holding company expenses increased by due to the additional stock based compensation of  recognized for the extension of the life of a stock option previously granted to our chairman of the board  chief executive officer and president and the additional costs associated with the hiring of our executive vice president of commercial operations 
interest income 
interest income  net of interest expenses declined by  due to the decline in yields on us treasury and money market securities  in which we invest our available cash 
comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  revenues 
revenues for the year ended december  were  compared to revenue of  for the year ended december  this increase of  or  was the result of an increase of  or  in contract revenue from cmt s mcs division  an increase of  or  in revenue from cmt s sm division  and a federal phase i grant award from the national institute of health to sentigen biosciences for  other than the federal phase i grant award received by sentigen biosciences  our revenues for were entirely attributable to the operations of cmt and its two divisions  mcs and sm 
an analysis of the revenues during from the mcs division is as follows for the year ended december  percent change hts contract   all other contracts   total   the increase from the mcs division was due in part to the renegotiation  as of january   of a significant contract for high throughput screening  or hts  services from a pay per service contract to a retainer contract 
the new retainer contract provides for payments of  per month  regardless of the volume of services performed 
the term of the contract was for one year and ended on december  cmt provided more hts services to this customer during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  and  under the old pay per service agreement  would have also shown an increase in revenues from this contract 
on december  this contract was renewed for a term of one year and provides for payments of  per month beginning in january the growth from other contracts was driven by mouse genetics services  protein expression services and services for the pre clinical analysis of compound efficacy on diminishing or eliminating pathogen infection 
revenues from the sm division grew for the year ended december  from the year ended december  this growth was driven by four factors an increase in sales of the sm division s line of murine embryonic stem cells and feeder cells as well as media associated with this product line  increase in sales of the sm division s proprietary formulations sold under private label  an increase in sales to japan through the sm division s distributor  the research products division of dainippon pharmaceuticals  and price increases implemented as of january  income after direct costs and gross margin 
income after direct costs for the year ended december  was  compared to income after direct costs of  for the year ended december  gross margin for the year ended december  excluding income after direct costs from the federal phase i grant award received by sentigen biosciences was compared to for the year ended december  this increase was driven by reduced direct materials costs for the mcs division  offset in part by rising serum costs in the sm division 
operating expenses 
operating expenses for the year ended december  were  compared to  for the year ended december  this increase of  or  was primarily attributable to an increase of  in selling  general and administrative expenses due to the increased rental and facilities expenses relating to the opening of cmt s new facility in phillipsburg  new jersey  as well as increases in salaries and employee health insurance expenses at cmt  and increases in cmt s advertising  marketing and sales costs 
a portion of the increase in operating expenses also was due to an increase of  in depreciation and amortization due to capital expenditures made in connection with cmt s new facilities and an increase of  in stock based compensation 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease of  in the research and development costs of sentigen biosciences due to the receipt of the grant from the national institute of health  and a decrease of  in corporate overhead driven by reduced professional fees 
loss from operations 
loss from operations for the year ended december  was  compared to a loss from operations of  for the year ended december  the components of this improvement were as follows for the year ended december  percent change cmt   sentigen biosciences   holding company expenses   total   income from operations for cmt increased by which was due to its increase in revenues 
loss from operations attributable to sentigen biosciences improved by which was due to the grant award from the nih  offset by higher stock based compensation costs 
sentigen biosciences operations consist entirely of research and development activities 
loss from operations attributable to holding company related expenses improved by which was largely attributable to lower professional fees 
interest income 
interest income  net of interest expenses declined by  or  due to the fall in yields on us treasury and money market securities 
liquidity and capital resources at december  we had  in cash and cash equivalents and working capital of  during the year ended december  we financed our operations and capital expenditures primarily through working capital and certain equipment leases were capitalized for accounting purposes 
on january  we sold  face value  us treasury notes maturing on october  the proceeds from the sale were reinvested in day us treasury bills 
capital gains recognized from the transaction were minimal 
this sale accounts for the majority of the  increase in cash and cash equivalents reported in our consolidated statement of cash flows 
we believe that our financial resources will be sufficient to fund operations and capital requirements for at least the next months 
however  we may  in the future  seek to obtain additional debt or equity financing to fund expanded research and development programs 
it is possible that any such financing may be dilutive to current stockholders and the terms of any debt financings likely could contain restrictive covenants limiting our ability to do certain things  including paying dividends 
our ability to obtain financing depends upon the status of future business prospects  as well as conditions prevailing in the capital markets 
cell molecular technologies  inc in july  cmt leased equipment for use in the performance of certain contracts in the mcs division 
the lease qualified for treatment as a capital lease for accounting purposes 
at the inception of the lease  equipment and an offsetting capital lease liability was recorded on our consolidated balance sheet in the amount of  we used a fixed interest rate of to approximate the borrowing rate for the lease 
the equipment is being depreciated on a straight line basis through the term of the lease which expires in june rental payments through december  totaled  of those payments   was applied to the capital lease liability and was applied to interest expense 
as of december  the total remaining lease obligation amounted to  in october  cmt leased equipment for use in the performance of certain contracts in the mcs division 
the lease qualified for treatment as a capital lease for accounting purposes 
at the inception of the lease  equipment and an offsetting capital lease liability was recorded on our consolidated balance sheet in the amount of  we used a fixed interest rate of to approximate the borrowing rate for the lease 
the equipment is being depreciated on a straight line basis through the term of the lease which expires in september rental payments for the year ended december  totaled  of those payments   was applied to the capital lease liability and  was applied to interest expense 
as of december  the total remaining lease obligation amounted to  during the first quarter of  cmt leased approximately  square feet of laboratory space to accommodate its high throughput screening support services group 
in connection with this new facility  cmt borrowed  under a  loan commitment to finance capital equipment expenditures 
in march  cmt borrowed the remaining  available under this loan commitment to finance capital expenditures made in connection with its leased facility in phillipsburg  new jersey 
cmt is required to repay this loan over a seven year period that commenced in june the terms of the loan require cmt to maintain annual cash flow equal to to times the total annual debt service of cmt and a ratio of debt to net worth of to 
cmt complied with these terms as of and during the twelve months ended december  sentigen holding corp 
guarantees this obligation of cmt 
the unpaid principal balance on this loan at december  was  on april   cmt renegotiated the interest rate on this loan from a fixed rate of to a fixed rate of 
the amortization period of the loan remained unchanged 
sentigen biosciences in june  sentigen biosciences borrowed an additional  under a  loan facility 
we are no longer able to borrow under this facility 
sentigen holding corp 
guarantees this obligation of sentigen biosciences 
the loan also requires that sentigen holding corp 
keep unencumbered liquid assets equaling two times the combined outstanding loan balances for sentigen and cmt 
we complied with these terms as of december  the loan is being amortized over a five year period and at december   sentigen biosciences had borrowed a total of  under this facility  and the unpaid principal balance on this loan was  on february  sentigen biosciences renegotiated the interest rate on this borrowing from the fixed rate of to a variable interest rate 
the variable interest rate is the prime rate plus with a minimum interest rate of 
sentigen biosciences was formed in february of and is focusing on research and development activities 
our licensing agreement with the trustees of the columbia university in new york required us to contribute a minimum of  into sentigen biosciences within one year of the date of the agreement by april or we must be involved in active negotiations to raise  in additional funding 
we satisfied this provision through the consummation of a private placement in november in which we sold  shares of our common stock at per share for aggregate gross proceeds of another provision of the agreement requires that a minimum of  per six month period or  per annual period be spent on bona fide research and development of the patents and licenses subject to the agreement from the second through the fourth years of the agreement april through april or we must be involved in active negotiation to raise  in additional funding 
we satisfied this provision through april and the second and third fiscal years of the license agreement 
we believe that we have sufficient capital resources to meet the financial requirements of this provision for the agreement years and beyond 
there is no assurance that the technology related to the licensing agreement with the trustees of columbia university or other technologies involved in the research and development activities of sentigen biosciences will prove to be productive 
in the event we decide to terminate such activities  there will be associated costs to us  such as payment to employees and expenses related to the closing of its facility at broadway  new york  new york 
no provisions have been made for such possible further expense
