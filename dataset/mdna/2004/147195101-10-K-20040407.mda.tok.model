item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company sold its hydraulic cylinder division in january the company s consolidated statements of income and cash flows for the year ended january  separately present the historical results of the hydraulic cylinder division as a discontinued operation 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of its financial position and results of operations is based on the company s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management evaluates its estimates and judgments on an on going basis  including those related to uncollectible receivables  inventories  goodwill and long lived assets  warranty obligations  environmental liabilities and deferred taxes 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies reflect its more significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
allowances for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses on accounts and notes receivable resulting from the inability of its customers and note holders to make required payments 
such allowances are based on an ongoing review of customer and note holder payments against terms and a review of customer and note holder financial statements and financial information 
if the financial condition of customers or the note holders were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory reserves inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
the company maintains reserves to write down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required  which would result in cost of goods sold in the consolidated statement of income being greater than expected in the period in which more information becomes available 
intangible assets the company adopted the financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets on accounting for business combinations and goodwill as of the beginning of fiscal accordingly  the company no longer amortizes goodwill from acquisitions 
the company continues to amortize other acquisition related intangibles  which are not significant to the company s consolidated balance sheet 
as of january  the company had million of goodwill 
in conjunction with the implementation of sfas  the company completed a transitional impairment test in the quarter ended april  and found no impairment 
as required by sfas  the company performs an impairment test annually  or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist 
certain factors the company considers important which could trigger an impairment review include  but are not limited to  significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the company s overall business and significant industry or economic trends 
the impairment review is based on a discounted cash flow approach that uses estimates of future sales  sales growth rates  gross margins  expense and capital expenditure levels  the discount rate and estimated terminal values to determine the fair value of the operating entities should an impairment exist 
changes in these and other factors could result in impairments in the carrying value of goodwill  which would require a write down or further write downs to the asset s fair value 
the company has performed annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of fiscal and and found no impairment 
warranty obligations the company offers certain warranties with the sale of its products 
the warranty obligation is recorded as a liability on the balance sheet and is estimated through historical customer claims  product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
changes in these factors and changes in statutory requirements for product warranties in markets in which the company sells its products may require an adjustment to the recorded warranty obligations 
environmental liabilities the company accrues environmental remediation and litigation costs if it is probable a liability has been incurred at the financial statement date and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
the company s liability for environmental costs  other than for costs of assessments themselves  are generally determined after the completion of investigations and studies and are based on the estimated cost of remediation activities the company is then required to undertake 
the gross liability is based on the company s best estimate of undiscounted future costs using currently available technology and applying current regulations  as well as the company s own historical experience regarding environmental cleanup costs 
the reliability and precision of the estimates are affected by numerous factors  such as site evaluation and reevaluation of the degree and remediation required  claims by third parties and changes to environmental laws and regulations 
the company adjusts its liabilities as new remediation requirements are defined  as information becomes available permitting reasonable estimates to be made and to reflect new facts 
deferred taxes the company s provision for income taxes and the determination of the resulting deferred tax assets and liabilities involves a significant amount of management judgment 
the company is subject to taxation from federal  state and international jurisdictions 
the taxes paid to these jurisdictions are subject to audit  although to date the results of any tax audits have been minor 
judgment is also applied in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of specific deferred tax assets  such as foreign tax credit carryovers or net operating loss carryforwards  will not be realized 
the company has recorded on its consolidated balance sheets a valuation allowance against various deferred tax assets 
the company considers future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
in the event the company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should the company determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made 
the company continually evaluates strategies that could allow for the future utilization of its deferred tax assets 
benefit plans the company makes a number of assumptions with regard to both future financial conditions and future actions by participants to calculate on an actuarial basis the amount of income or expense and assets and liabilities recognized in association with the company s defined benefit and postretirement benefit plans 
these assumptions include the expected return on plan assets  discount rate  health care cost trend rates and expected rates of retirement for plan participants 
the company reviews the assumptions on an annual basis and makes changes to reflect market conditions and the administration of the plans 
while the company believes the current assumptions are appropriate in the circumstances  actual results and changes in these assumptions in the future will result in adjustments which could impact the income or expense recognized in future years in relation to these plans

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations 
a significant portion of the company s net sales are denominated in currencies from international markets outside the united states 
as a result  the company s operating results could become subject to significant fluctuations based upon changes in the exchange rates of the foreign currencies in relation to the united states dollar 
the table below illustrates the hypothetical increase in net sales of a weaker us dollar against foreign currencies which impact the company s operations in millions euro canadian dollar british pound other currencies with net sales less than of consolidated net sales the company enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to offset the impact of currency fluctuations on certain nonfunctional currency assets and liabilities 
the principal currencies hedged are denominated in japanese yen  canadian dollars  euros and british pounds 
the company s foreign currency forward exchange contracts have terms lasting up to six months  but generally less than one month 
the company does not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
see note to the consolidated financial statements item 
a majority of the company s products are manufactured using steel as a primary raw material and steel based components as purchased parts 
as such  the company s cost of goods sold is sensitive to fluctuations in steel prices  either directly through the purchase of steel as raw material or indirectly through the purchase of steel based components 
presuming that the full impact of commodity steel price increases is reflected in all steel and steel based component purchases  the company estimates its gross margin percentage sensitivity to be approximately for each increase in commodity steel prices 
for example  if the price of commodity steel increases  and the full impact of that increase is reflected in all raw material and component purchases  the net decrease in the gross margin percentage would be approximately 
based on the company s statement of income for the year ended january   a increase in commodity steel prices would have decreased consolidated gross profit by approximately  the company intends to aggressively offset any increases in steel prices through a number of mitigating strategies  including but not limited to temporary surcharges  general price increases and alternative sourcing 
it must be noted that there may be some time lag between realizing the offsetting benefits of the mitigating measures and the absorption of the steel price increases 
substantially all of the company s debt at january  has a fixed interest rate 
any additional payments to prepay scheduled amounts of debt are subject to penalties 
at january  the penalties to retire all of the company s long term debt were million 
a hypothetical immediate increase in interest rates by would decrease the fair value of the company s long term debt outstanding at january  by million
