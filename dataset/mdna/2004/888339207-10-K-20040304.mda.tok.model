part i item business general 
titanium metals corporation timet or the company was originally formed in and was incorporated in delaware in timet is one of the world s leading producers of titanium sponge and titanium melted and mill products 
the company is the only producer with major titanium production facilities in both the united states and europe  the world s principal markets for titanium consumption 
titanium was first manufactured for commercial use in the s 
titanium s unique combination of corrosion resistance  elevated temperature performance and high strength to weight ratio makes it particularly desirable for use in commercial and military aerospace applications where these qualities are essential design requirements for certain critical parts such as wing supports and jet engine components 
while aerospace applications have historically accounted for a substantial portion of the worldwide demand for titanium and represented approximately of aggregate mill product shipments in  the number of non aerospace end use markets for titanium has expanded substantially 
today  numerous industrial uses for titanium exist  including chemical and industrial power plants  desalination plants and pollution control equipment 
demand for titanium is also increasing in emerging markets with such diverse uses as offshore oil and gas production installations  geothermal facilities  military armor  automotive and architectural applications 
timet s products include titanium sponge  melted products  mill products and industrial fabrications 
the titanium industry is comprised of several manufacturers that  like timet  produce a relatively complete range of titanium products and a significant number of producers worldwide that manufacture a limited range of titanium mill products 
the company is currently the only major us titanium sponge producer 
the company estimates that it accounted for approximately of worldwide industry shipments of titanium mill products in both and the company also estimates it accounted for approximately of worldwide titanium sponge production in the company s long term strategy is to maximize the value of its core aerospace business while also developing new markets  applications and products to help reduce its traditional dependence on the aerospace industry 
in the near term  the company continues to focus on reducing its cost structure  reducing inventories  improving the quality of its products and processes and taking other actions to continue to generate positive cash flow and return to profitability 
industry 
the titanium industry historically has derived a substantial portion of its business from the aerospace industry 
aerospace demand for titanium products  which includes both jet engine components eg  blades  discs  rings and engine cases and air frame components eg  bulkheads  tail sections  landing gear  wing supports and fasteners can be broken down into commercial and military sectors 
the commercial aerospace sector has a significant influence on titanium companies  particularly mill product producers such as timet 
in  the company estimates the commercial aerospace sector accounted for mill product shipments of approximately  metric tons  a decrease from  and represented approximately of aerospace industry mill product shipments and of aggregate mill product shipments 
mill product shipments to the military aerospace sector in were approximately  metric tons  a increase from  and represented approximately of aerospace industry mill product shipments and of aggregate mill product shipments 
military aerospace sector shipments are largely driven by government defense spending in north america and europe 
as discussed further below  new aircraft programs generally are in development for several years  followed by multi year procurement contracts 
the company s business is more dependent on aerospace demand than the overall titanium industry  as approximately of the company s mill product shipment volume in was to the aerospace industry commercial aerospace and military aerospace 
the cyclical nature of the aerospace industry has been the principal driver of the historical fluctuations in the performance of most titanium companies 
over the past years  the titanium industry had cyclical peaks in mill product shipments in  and and cyclical lows in  and demand for titanium reached its highest level in when industry mill product shipments reached approximately  metric tons 
however  since that peak  industry mill product shipments have fluctuated significantly  primarily due to a continued change in demand for titanium from the commercial aerospace sector 
in  industry shipments approximated  metric tons  and in the company estimates industry shipments approximated  metric tons 
the company currently expects total industry mill product shipments in will increase from levels to at least  metric tons 
the airline monitor  a leading aerospace publication  traditionally issues forecasts for commercial aircraft deliveries each january and july 
according to the airline monitor  large commercial aircraft deliveries for the to period peaked in with aircraft  including wide body aircraft that use substantially more titanium than their narrow body counterparts 
large commercial aircraft deliveries totaled including wide bodies in the airline monitor s most recently issued forecast january calls for deliveries in  deliveries in and deliveries in relative to  these forecasted delivery rates represent anticipated declines of about in  in and in from through  the airline monitor calls for a continued increase each year in large commercial aircraft deliveries  with forecasted deliveries of aircraft in  exceeding levels 
deliveries of titanium generally precede aircraft deliveries by about one year  although this varies considerably by titanium product 
this correlates to the company s cycle  which historically precedes the cycle of the aircraft industry and related deliveries 
although the commercial airline industry continues to face significant challenges  recent economic data show signs of an improving business environment in that sector 
according to the airline monitor  the worldwide commercial airline industry reported an estimated operating loss of approximately billion in  compared to a billion loss in and an billion loss in the airline monitor is currently forecasting operating income of approximately billion for the industry in additionally  global airline passenger traffic returned to pre september  levels in november although these appear to be positive signs  the company currently believes that industry mill product shipments into the commercial aerospace sector will be somewhat flat in and show a modest upturn in military aerospace programs were the first to utilize titanium s unique properties on a large scale  beginning in the s 
titanium shipments to military aerospace markets reached a peak in the s before falling to historical lows in the early s after the end of the cold war 
however  the importance of military markets to the titanium industry is expected to rise in coming years as defense spending budgets increase in reaction to terrorist activities and global conflicts 
it is estimated that overall titanium consumption will increase in this market sector in and beyond  but consumption by military applications will offset only a relatively small part of the decrease seen in the commercial aerospace sector 
several of today s active us military aircraft programs  including the c  f a  f and f began during the cold war and are forecast to continue production for the foreseeable future 
in addition to these established programs  new programs in the united states offer growth opportunities for increased titanium consumption 
the f a raptor is currently in low rate initial production  and us air force officials have expressed a need for a minimum of airplanes  but cost overruns and development delays may result in reduced procurement over the life of the program 
in october  lockheed martin corporation was awarded what could eventually become the largest military contract ever for the f joint strike fighter jsf 
the jsf is expected to enter low rate initial production in late  and although no specific order and delivery patterns have been established  procurement is expected to extend over the next to years and include as many as  to  planes 
european military programs also have active aerospace programs offering the possibility for increased titanium consumption 
production levels for the saab gripen  eurofighter typhoon  dassault rafale and dassault mirage are all forecasted to increase over the next decade 
since titanium s initial applications in the aerospace sector  the number of end use markets for titanium has significantly expanded 
established industrial uses for titanium include chemical plants  industrial power plants  desalination plants and pollution control equipment 
titanium continues to gain acceptance in many emerging market applications  including automotive  military armor  energy and architecture 
although titanium is generally higher cost than other competing metals  in many cases customers find the physical properties of titanium to be attractive from the standpoint of weight  performance  longevity  design alternatives  life cycle value and other factors 
although emerging market demand presently represents only about of the total industry demand for titanium mill products today  the company believes emerging market demand  in the aggregate  could grow at double digit rates over the next several years 
the company is actively pursuing these markets 
although difficult to predict  the automotive market continues to be an attractive emerging segment due to its potential for sustainable long term growth 
for this reason  in  timet established a new division  timet automotive  focused on the development of the automobile  truck and motorcycle markets 
the division is tasked with developing and marketing proprietary alloys and processes specifically suited for automotive applications and supporting supply chain activities for automotive manufacturers to most cost effectively engineer titanium components 
titanium is now used in several consumer car applications  including the corvette z  toyota alteeza  infiniti q  volkswagen lupo fsi  honda s and mercedes s class and in numerous motorcycles 
at the present time  titanium is primarily used for exhaust systems  suspension springs and engine valves in consumer vehicles 
in exhaust systems  titanium provides for significant weight savings  while its corrosion resistance provides life of vehicle durability 
in suspension spring applications  titanium s low modulus of elasticity allows the spring s height to be reduced by to compared to a steel spring  which  when combined with the titanium s low density  permits to weight savings over steel spring suspension systems 
the lower spring height provides vehicle designers new styling alternatives and improved performance opportunities 
titanium suspension springs and exhaust applications are also attractive compared to alternative lightweight technologies because the titanium component can often be formed and fabricated on the same tooling used for the steel component it is typically replacing 
this is especially attractive for the rapidly growing niche vehicle market sectors that often seek the performance attributes that titanium provides  but where tooling costs prohibit alternative light weighting or other improved performance strategies 
titanium is also making inroads into other automotive applications  including turbo charger wheels  brake parts and connecting rods 
titanium engine components provide mass reduction benefits that directly improve vehicle performance and fuel economy 
in certain applications  titanium engine components can provide a cost effective alternative to engine balance shafts to address noise  vibration and harshness while simultaneously improving performance 
the decision to select titanium components for consumer car  truck and motorcycle components remains highly cost sensitive  however  the company believes titanium s acceptance in consumer vehicles will expand as the automotive industry continues to better understand the benefits titanium offers 
utilization of titanium on military ground combat vehicles for armor applique and integrated armor or structural components continues to gain acceptance within the military market segment 
titanium armor components provide the necessary ballistic performance while achieving a mission critical vehicle performance objective of reduced weight 
in order to counteract increased threat levels  titanium is being utilized on vehicle upgrade programs in addition to new builds 
based on active programs  as well as programs currently under evaluation  the company believes there will be additional usage of titanium on ground combat vehicles that will provide continued growth in the military market segment 
the oil and gas market utilizes titanium for down hole logging tools  critical riser components  fire water systems and saltwater cooling systems 
additionally  as offshore development of new oil and gas fields moves into the ultra deep water depths  market demand for titanium s light weight  high strength and corrosion resistance properties is creating new opportunities for the material 
the company has a dedicated group that is focused on developing the expansion of titanium use in this market and in other non aerospace applications 
products and operations 
the company is a vertically integrated titanium manufacturer whose products include i titanium sponge  the basic form of titanium metal used in processed titanium products  ii melted products ingot and slab  the result of melting sponge and titanium scrap  either alone or with various other alloying elements  iii mill products that are forged and rolled from ingot or slab  including long products billet and bar  flat products plate  sheet and strip and pipe and iv fabrications that are cut  formed  welded and assembled from titanium mill products spools  pipefittings  manifolds  vessels  etc during the past three years  all of timet s sales revenue was generated by the company s integrated titanium operations its titanium melted and mill products segment  its only business segment 
business and geographic segment financial information is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
titanium sponge so called because of its appearance is the commercially pure  elemental form of titanium metal 
the first step in timet s sponge production involves the chlorination of titanium containing rutile ores derived from beach sand with chlorine and petroleum coke to produce titanium tetrachloride 
titanium tetrachloride is purified and then reacted with magnesium in a closed system  producing titanium sponge and magnesium chloride as co products 
the company s titanium sponge production facility in henderson  nevada incorporates vacuum distillation process vdp technology  which removes the magnesium and magnesium chloride residues by applying heat to the sponge mass while maintaining a vacuum in the chamber 
the combination of heat and vacuum boils the residues from the sponge mass  and then the mass is mechanically pushed out of the distillation vessel  sheared and crushed  while the residual magnesium chloride is electrolytically separated and recycled 
titanium ingot and slab are solid shapes cylindrical and rectangular  respectively that weigh up to metric tons in the case of ingot and up to metric tons in the case of slab 
each ingot or slab is formed by melting titanium sponge  scrap or both  usually with various other alloying elements such as vanadium  aluminum  molybdenum  tin and zirconium 
titanium scrap is a by product of the forging  rolling  milling and machining operations  and significant quantities of scrap are generated in the production process for finished titanium products and components 
the melting process for ingot and slab is closely controlled and monitored utilizing computer control systems to maintain product quality and consistency and to meet customer specifications 
in most cases  timet uses its ingot and slab as the starting material for further processing into mill products 
however  it also sells ingot and slab to third parties 
titanium mill products result from the forging  rolling  drawing  welding  cutting and or extrusion of titanium ingot or slab into products of various sizes and grades 
these mill products include titanium billet  bar  rod  plate  sheet  strip and pipe 
fabrications result from the cutting  forming  welding and assembling of titanium mill products into various products such as spools  pipefittings  manifolds and vessels 
the company sends certain products either to the company s service centers or to outside vendors for further processing before being shipped to customers 
the company s customers either process the company s products for their ultimate end use or for sale to third parties 
during the production process and following the completion of manufacturing  the company performs extensive testing on its products 
the inspection process is critical to ensuring that the company s products meet the high quality requirements of its customers  particularly in aerospace component production 
the company certifies that its products meet customer specification at the time of shipment for substantially all customer orders 
the company is reliant on several outside processors to perform certain rolling  finishing and other processing steps in the us  and certain melting and forging steps in france 
in the us  one of these outside processors is owned by a competitor  and another is operated by a customer 
these processors are currently timet s primary source for these services 
other processors used in the us are not competitors or customers 
in france  the processor is also a joint venture partner in the company s owned subsidiary  timet savoie  sa timet savoie 
during  the company made significant strides toward reducing the reliance on competitor owned sources for these services  so that any interruption in these functions should not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  financial position and liquidity 
distribution 
the company sells its products through its own sales force based in the us and europe and through independent agents and distributors worldwide 
the company s marketing and distribution system also includes eight company owned service centers five in the us and three in europe  which sell the company s products on a just in time basis 
the service centers primarily sell value added and customized mill products including bar  flat rolled sheet and strip 
the company believes its service centers provide a competitive advantage because of their ability to foster customer relationships  customize products to suit specific customer requirements and respond quickly to customer needs 
raw materials 
the principal raw materials used in the production of titanium ingot  slab and mill products are titanium sponge  titanium scrap and alloying elements 
during  approximately of the company s melted and mill product raw material requirements were fulfilled with internally produced sponge  with purchased sponge  with titanium scrap and with alloying elements 
the primary raw materials used in the production of titanium sponge are titanium containing rutile ore  chlorine  magnesium and petroleum coke 
rutile ore is currently available from a limited number of suppliers around the world  principally located in australia  south africa and sri lanka 
the company purchases the majority of its supply of rutile ore from australia 
the company believes the availability of rutile ore will be adequate for the foreseeable future and does not anticipate any interruptions of its rutile supplies  although political or economic instability in the countries from which the company purchases its rutile could materially adversely affect availability 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will not experience interruptions 
chlorine is currently obtained from a single supplier near the company s sponge plant in henderson  nevada 
while the company does not presently anticipate any chlorine supply problems  there can be no assurances the chlorine supply will not be interrupted 
in the event of supply disruption  the company has taken steps to mitigate this risk  including establishing the feasibility of certain equipment modifications to enable it to utilize material from alternative chlorine suppliers or to purchase and utilize an intermediate product which will allow the company to eliminate the purchase of chlorine if needed 
magnesium and petroleum coke are generally available from a number of suppliers 
while the company was one of five major worldwide producers of titanium sponge in  it cannot supply all of its needs for all grades of titanium sponge internally and is dependent  therefore  on third parties for a substantial portion of its sponge requirements 
titanium melted and mill products require varying grades of sponge and or scrap depending on the customers specifications and expected end use 
timet is the only active major us producer of titanium sponge 
presently  timet and certain companies in japan are the only producers of premium quality sponge that currently have complete approval for all significant demanding aerospace applications 
during  two other sponge producers received additional qualification of their products for certain critical aerospace applications 
this qualification process is likely to continue for several more years 
historically  the company has purchased sponge predominantly from producers in japan and kazakhstan 
in september  the company entered into a sponge supply agreement  effective from january  through december   which requires minimum purchases by the company of approximately million annually through this agreement replaced a agreement 
the company has no other long term sponge supply agreements 
since  the company has also purchased sponge from the us defense logistics agency dla stockpile 
in  the company expects to continue to purchase sponge from a variety of sources 
the company utilizes a combination of internally produced  customer returned and externally produced titanium scrap at all of its melting locations 
such scrap consists of alloyed and commercially pure solids and turnings 
internally produced scrap is generated in the company s factories during both melting and mill product processing 
customer returned scrap is generally part of a supply agreement with a customer  which provides a closed loop arrangement resulting in supply and cost stability 
externally produced scrap is purchased from a wide range of sources  including customers  collectors  processors and brokers 
in  the company anticipates that approximately half the scrap it will utilize will be purchased from external suppliers 
the company also sells scrap  usually in a form or grade it cannot economically recycle 
market forces can significantly impact the supply or cost of externally produced scrap 
during cycles in the titanium business  the amount of scrap generated in the supply chain varies 
during the middle of the cycle  scrap generation and consumption are in relative equilibrium  minimizing disruptions in supply or significant changes in market prices for scrap 
increasing or decreasing cycles tend to cause significant changes in the market price of scrap 
early in the titanium cycle  when the demand for titanium melted and mill products begins to increase  the company s requirements and those of other titanium manufacturers precede the increase in scrap generation by downstream customers and the supply chain  placing upward pressure on the market price of scrap 
the opposite situation occurs when demand for titanium melted and mill products begins to decline  placing downward pressure on the market price of scrap 
as a net purchaser of scrap  the company is susceptible to price increases during periods of increasing demand  although this phenomena normally results in higher selling prices for melted and mill products  which tend to offset the increased material costs 
all of the company s major competitors utilize scrap as a raw material in their melt operations 
in addition to use by titanium manufacturers  titanium scrap is used in steel making operations during production of interstitial free steels  stainless steels and high strength low alloy steels 
current demand for these steel products  especially from china  have produced a significant increase in demand for titanium scrap at a time when titanium scrap generation rates are at low levels because of the lower commercial aircraft build rates 
these events are expected to cause a relative shortage of titanium scrap in  resulting in tight supply and higher prices  which will directly impact the approximate of scrap the company purchases from external sources 
the company s ability to recover these material costs via higher selling prices to its customers is uncertain 
various alloying elements used in the production of titanium products are also available from a number of suppliers 
customer agreements 
the company has long term agreements ltas with certain major aerospace customers  including  among others  the boeing company boeing  rolls royce plc and its german and us affiliates rolls royce  united technologies corporation pratt whitney and related companies and wyman gordon company wyman gordon  a unit of precision castparts corporation pcc 
these agreements expire from through  subject to certain conditions  and generally provide for i minimum market shares of the customers titanium requirements or firm annual volume commitments and ii fixed or formula determined prices although some contain elements based on market pricing 
generally  the ltas require the company s service and product performance to meet specified criteria and contain a number of other terms and conditions customary in transactions of these types 
in certain events of nonperformance by the company  the ltas may be terminated early 
although it is possible that some portion of the business would continue on a non lta basis  the termination of one or more of the ltas could result in a material and adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  financial position or liquidity 
the ltas were designed to limit selling price volatility to the customer  while providing timet with a committed base of volume throughout the aerospace business cycles 
to varying degrees  these ltas effectively obligate timet to bear all or part of the risks of increases in raw material and other costs  but also allow timet to benefit from decreases in such costs 
during the third quarter of  the company and wyman gordon agreed to terminate the purchase and sale agreement associated with the formation of the titanium castings joint venture previously owned by the two parties 
the company agreed to pay wyman gordon a total of million in three quarterly installments in connection with this termination  which included the termination of certain favorable purchase terms 
the company recorded a one time charge for the entire million as a reduction to sales in the third quarter of concurrently  the company entered into new long term purchase and sale agreements with wyman gordon that expire in in april  the company reached a settlement of the litigation between timet and boeing related to the parties lta entered into in pursuant to the settlement  the company received a cash payment of million from boeing 
under the terms of the lta  as amended  in years through  boeing advances timet million annually less per pound of titanium product purchased by boeing subcontractors during the preceding year 
effectively  the company collects less from boeing than the lta selling price for each pound of titanium product sold directly to boeing and reduces the related customer advance recorded by the company 
for titanium products sold to boeing subcontractors  the company collects the full lta selling price  but gives boeing credit by reducing the next year s annual advance by per pound of titanium product sold to boeing subcontractors 
the boeing customer advance is also reduced as take or pay benefits are earned  as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
under a separate agreement timet must establish and hold buffer stock for boeing at timet s facilities  for which boeing will pay timet as such product is produced 
see item md a for additional information regarding the boeing lta 
the company also has an lta with valtimet sas valtimet  a manufacturer of welded stainless steel and titanium tubing that is principally sold into the industrial markets 
valtimet is a owned affiliate of timet 
the lta was entered into in and expires in under the lta  valtimet has agreed to purchase a certain percentage of its titanium requirements from timet at formula determined selling prices  subject to certain conditions 
certain provisions of this contract have been amended in the past and may be amended in the future to meet changing business conditions 
markets and customer base 
approximately of the company s sales revenue was generated by sales to customers within north america  as compared to in and in approximately of the company s sales revenue was generated by sales to european customers  as compared to in and in the balance of the company s sales was to other regions throughout the world 
further information regarding the company s external sales  net income  long lived assets and total assets by segment can be found in the company s consolidated balance sheets  consolidated statements of operations and note to the consolidated financial statements 
approximately of the company s sales revenue was generated by sales to the aerospace industry in  as compared to in and in sales under the company s ltas accounted for approximately of its sales revenue in sales to pcc and its related entities approximated of the company s sales revenue in sales to rolls royce and other rolls royce suppliers under the rolls royce ltas including direct sales to certain of the pcc related entities under the terms of the rolls royce ltas represented approximately of the company s sales revenue in the company expects that a majority of its sales revenue will be to the aerospace industry 
the primary market for titanium products in the commercial aerospace industry consists of two major manufacturers of large over seats commercial airframes boeing commercial airplanes group a unit of boeing and airbus owned by european aeronautic defence and space company and owned by bae systems 
in addition to the airframe manufacturers  the following four manufacturers of large civil aircraft engines are also significant titanium users rolls royce  pratt whitney  general electric aircraft engines and societe nationale d etude et de construction de moteurs d aviation snecma 
the company s sales are made both directly to these major manufacturers and to companies including forgers such as wyman gordon that use the company s titanium to produce parts and other materials for such manufacturers 
if any of the major aerospace manufacturers were to significantly reduce aircraft and or jet engine build rates from those currently expected  there could be a material adverse effect  both directly and indirectly  on the company 
as of december   the estimated firm order backlog for boeing and airbus  as reported by the airline monitor  was  planes  versus  planes at the end of and  planes at the end of the estimated firm order backlog for wide body planes at year end was of total backlog compared to of total backlog at the end of and of total backlog at the end of the backlogs for boeing and airbus reflect orders for aircraft to be delivered over several years 
changes in the economic environment and the financial condition of airlines can result in rescheduling or cancellation of contractual orders 
accordingly  aircraft manufacturer backlogs are not necessarily a reliable indicator of near term business activity  but may be indicative of potential business levels over a longer term horizon 
wide body planes eg  boeing  and and airbus a and a tend to use a higher percentage of titanium in their airframes  engines and parts than narrow body planes eg  boeing and and airbus a  a and a  and newer models of planes tend to use a higher percentage of titanium than older models 
additionally  boeing generally uses a higher percentage of titanium in its airframes than airbus 
for example  the company estimates that approximately metric tons  metric tons and metric tons of titanium are purchased for the manufacture of each boeing  and  respectively  including both the airframes and engines 
the company estimates that approximately metric tons  metric tons and metric tons of titanium are purchased for the manufacture of each airbus a  a and a  respectively  including both the airframes and engines 
at year end  a total of firm orders had been placed for the airbus a superjumbo jet  a program officially launched in december with anticipated first deliveries in current estimates are that approximately metric tons of titanium metric tons for the airframe and metric tons for the engines will be purchased for each a manufactured  the most of any commercial aircraft 
additionally  boeing currently plans a mid production launch for its newly announced model  the e dreamliner 
although this airplane will contain more composite materials than a typical boeing airplane  initial estimates are that approximately metric tons of titanium will be purchased for each e airframe manufactured 
engine estimates are not yet available for the e outside of aerospace markets  the company manufactures a wide range of products  including sheet  plate  tube  bar  billet  pipe and skelp  for customers in the chemical process  oil and gas  consumer  sporting goods  automotive  power generation and armor armament industries 
approximately of the company s sales revenue in and in and was generated by sales into industrial and emerging markets  including sales to valtimet for the production of condenser tubing 
for the oil and gas industry  the company provides seamless pipe for downhole casing  risers  tapered stress joints and other offshore oil production equipment  including fabrication of sub sea manifolds 
in armor and armament  the company sells plate products for fabrication into door hatches on fighting vehicles  as well as tank turret protection 
in addition to melted and mill products  which are sold into the aerospace  industrial and emerging markets  the company sells certain other products such as titanium sponge  titanium tetrachloride and fabricated titanium assemblies 
sales of these other products represented of the company s sales revenue in  in and in the company s backlog of unfilled orders was approximately million at december   compared to million at december  and million at december  substantially the entire year end backlog is scheduled for shipment during the company s order backlog may not be a reliable indicator of future business activity 
the company has explored and will continue to explore strategic arrangements in the areas of product development  production and distribution 
the company also will continue to work with existing and potential customers to identify and develop new or improved applications for titanium that take advantage of its unique qualities 
competition 
the titanium metals industry is highly competitive on a worldwide basis 
producers of melted and mill products are located primarily in the united states  japan  france  germany  italy  russia  china and the united kingdom 
there are currently five major  and several minor  producers of titanium sponge in the world 
timet is currently the only active major us sponge producer 
producers of other metal products  such as steel and aluminum  maintain forging  rolling and finishing facilities that could be used or modified without substantial expenditures to process titanium products 
the company believes  however  that entry as a producer of titanium sponge would require a significant capital investment and substantial technical expertise 
titanium mill products also compete with stainless steel  nickel alloys  steel  plastics  aluminum and composites in many applications 
the company s principal competitors in the aerospace market are allegheny technologies incorporated and rti international metals  inc  both based in the united states  and verkhnaya salda metallurgical production organization vsmpo  based in russia 
these companies  along with certain japanese producers and certain other companies  are also principal competitors in the industrial and emerging markets 
the company competes primarily on the basis of price  quality of products  technical support and the availability of products to meet customers delivery schedules 
in the us market  the increasing presence of us participants has become a significant competitive factor 
until  imports of foreign titanium products into the us had not been significant 
this was primarily attributable to relative currency exchange rates and  with respect to japan  russia  kazakhstan and ukraine  import duties including antidumping duties 
however  since  imports of titanium sponge  ingot and mill products  principally from russia and kazakhstan  have increased and have had a significant competitive impact on the us titanium industry 
to the extent the company has been able to take advantage of this situation by purchasing sponge  ingot or intermediate and finished mill products from such countries for use in its own operations  the negative effect of these imports on the company has been somewhat mitigated 
generally  imports of titanium products into the us are subject to a normal trade relations tariff 
for tariff purposes  titanium products are broadly classified as either wrought billet  bar  sheet  strip  plate and tubing or unwrought sponge  ingot and slab 
the us maintains a trade program  referred to as the generalized system of preferences or gsp program designed  to promote the economies of a number of lesser developed countries referred to as beneficiary developing countries by eliminating duties on a specific list of products imported from any of these beneficiary developing countries 
of the key titanium producing countries outside the us  russia and kazakhstan are currently regarded as beneficiary developing countries under the gsp program 
for most periods since  imports of titanium wrought products from any beneficiary developing country notably russia  as a producer of wrought products were exempted from us import duties under the gsp program 
in  timet filed a petition seeking the removal of duty free treatment under the gsp program for imports of titanium wrought products into the us from russia 
action on the timet petition has been deferred  meaning duty free treatment on imports of titanium wrought products into the us from russia will continue for the time being 
in  kazakhstan filed a petition with the office of the us trade representative seeking gsp status on imports of titanium sponge into the us  which  if granted  would have eliminated the tariff currently imposed on titanium sponge imported into the us from any beneficiary developing country notably russia and kazakhstan  as producers of titanium sponge 
on july   kazakhstan s petition was denied 
timet has successfully resisted  and will continue to resist  efforts to eliminate duties on sponge and unwrought titanium products  and timet has pursued and will continue to pursue the removal of gsp status for titanium wrought products  although no assurances can be made that the company will continue to be successful in these activities 
further reductions in  or the complete elimination of  any or all of these tariffs  including expansion of the gsp program to unwrought titanium products  could lead to increased imports of foreign sponge  ingot and mill products into the us and an increase in the amount of such products on the market generally  which could adversely affect pricing for titanium sponge  ingot and mill products and thus the company s business  results of operations  financial position or liquidity 
research and development 
the company s research and development activities are directed toward expanding the use of titanium and titanium alloys in all market sectors 
key research activities include the development of new alloys  development of technology required to enhance the performance of timet s products in the traditional industrial and aerospace markets and applications development in the automotive division and other emerging markets 
the company conducts the majority of its research and development activities at its henderson technical laboratory in henderson  nevada  with additional activities at its witton  england facility 
the company incurred research and development costs of million in  million in and million in in april  the company was selected by the united states defense advanced research projects agency darpa to lead a program aimed at commercializing the ffc cambridge process 
the ffc cambridge process  developed by professor derek fray  dr 
tom farthing and dr 
george chen at the university of cambridge  represents a potential breakthrough technology in the process of extracting titanium from titanium bearing ores 
this program will receive up to approximately million in government funding over the next five years 
as part of the program  timet is leading a team of scientists from major defense contractors  including general electric aircraft engines  united defense limited partners and pratt whitney  as well as the university of california at berkeley and the university of cambridge 
the funding is allocated among all of the program partners including timet to cover program costs 
additionally  timet contributes unreimbursed personnel time to assist in the research 
in connection with the program  timet has negotiated a non exclusive development and production license for the ffc cambridge process technology from british titanium plc 
timet is conducting the development work at its henderson technical laboratory 
while much work must be done and success is by no means a certainty  the company considers this a significant opportunity to achieve a meaningful reduction in the cost of producing titanium metal 
if successful  the company believes this would not only make titanium a more attractive material choice within the aerospace industry  but also could provide opportunities to use titanium in non aerospace applications where its cost might have previously been an obstacle 
patents and trademarks 
the company holds us and us patents applicable to certain of its titanium alloys and manufacturing technology 
the company continually seeks patent protection with respect to its technical base and has occasionally entered into cross licensing arrangements with third parties 
the company believes the trademarks timet r and timetal r  which are protected by registration in the us and other countries  are important to its business 
further  timet feels its proprietary timetal exhaust grade  patented timetal s connecting rod alloy  patented timetal lcb spring alloy and patented timetal ti engine valve alloy give it competitive advantages in the automotive market 
however  most of the titanium alloys and manufacturing technology used by the company do not benefit from patent or other intellectual property protection 
employees

the cyclical nature of the aerospace industry has been the principal driver of the historical fluctuations in the performance of most titanium companies 
over the past years  the titanium industry had cyclical peaks in mill product shipments in  and and cyclical lows in  and demand for titanium reached its highest level in when industry mill product shipments reached approximately  metric tons 
however  since that peak  industry mill product shipments have fluctuated significantly  primarily due to a continued change in demand for titanium from the commercial aerospace sector 
in  industry shipments approximated  metric tons  and in the company estimates industry shipments approximated  metric tons 
the company currently expects total industry mill product shipments in will increase from levels to at least  metric tons 
although the commercial airline industry continues to face significant challenges  recent economic data show signs of an improving business environment in that sector 
according to the airline monitor  the worldwide commercial airline industry reported an estimated operating loss of approximately billion in  compared to a billion loss in and an billion loss in the airline monitor is currently forecasting operating income of approximately billion for the industry in furthermore  global airline passenger traffic returned to pre september  levels in november of although these appear to be positive signs  the company currently believes that industry mill product shipments into the commercial aerospace sector will be somewhat flat in and show a modest upturn in the airline monitor traditionally issues forecasts for commercial aircraft deliveries each january and july 
according to the airline monitor  large commercial aircraft deliveries totaled including wide bodies in the airline monitor s most recently issued forecast january calls for deliveries in  deliveries in and deliveries in relative to  these forecasted delivery rates represent anticipated declines of about in  in and in from through  the airline monitor calls for a continued increase each year in large commercial aircraft deliveries  with forecasted deliveries of aircraft in  exceeding levels 
deliveries of titanium generally precede aircraft deliveries by about one year  although this varies considerably by titanium product 
this correlates to the company s cycle  which historically precedes the cycle of the aircraft industry and related deliveries 
although the current business environment continues to make it difficult to predict future performance  the company expects sales revenue in to increase to between million and million  reflecting the combined effects of increases in sales volume and market share and relative weakness of the us dollar as compared to the british pound sterling and the euro  partially offset by customer and product mix 
mill product sales volume  which was  metric tons in  is expected to increase to between  and  metric tons in melted product sales volume  which was  metric tons in  is expected to increase to between  and  metric tons in the company expects between and of its mill and melted product sales volume will be derived from the commercial aerospace sector which would be a slight decrease from  with the balance from military aerospace  industrial and emerging markets 
the expected increase in sales volume in is principally driven by an anticipated increase in sales volume to industrial and emerging markets 
additionally  the company s backlog of unfilled orders was approximately million at december   compared to million at december  and million at december  substantially the entire year end backlog is scheduled for shipment during the company s order backlog may not be a reliable indicator of future business activity 
the company s cost of sales is affected by a number of factors including customer and product mix  material yields  plant operating rates  raw material costs  labor costs and energy costs 
raw material costs represent the largest portion of the company s manufacturing cost structure 
the company has recently been experiencing higher raw material prices due to a tightening in raw material availability  especially in the scrap markets 
the company also expects an increase in energy costs in the company expects to manufacture a significant portion of its titanium sponge requirements in the unit cost of titanium sponge manufactured at timet s henderson  nevada facility is expected to decrease relative to  due primarily to higher sponge plant operating rates as the plant moves to full capacity by the third quarter of the company expects the aggregate cost of purchased sponge and scrap to increase during the company expects production volumes to increase in  increasing overall capacity utilization to between and in as compared to in 
however  practical capacity utilization measures can vary significantly based on product mix 
the company continues to identify areas for potential cost savings  in addition to the savings realized in  and expects gross margin in to range from to of net sales 
selling  general  administrative and development expenses in should approximate million 
the company anticipates that it will receive orders from boeing for about million pounds of product during at this projected order level  the company expects to recognize about million of operating income in under the boeing lta s take or pay provisions 
the current outlook is for operating income of between million and million  which includes the effect of a million reduction in the company s vacation accrual for us employees effective january  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
excluding the boeing take or pay income  the company currently expects operating results in to range between operating income of million and operating loss of million 
in  interest expense on the company s subordinated debentures held by the capital trust should approximate million  including additional interest costs related to the deferral of the interest payments on the subordinated debentures 
the company s board of directors will consider resuming interest payments on the subordinated debentures once the longer term outlook for the company s business improves substantially 
the company currently expects its bottom line to range between a net loss of million and net income of million 
excluding the boeing take or pay income  the company currently expects a net loss in of between million and million 
the company expects to generate million to million in cash flows from operations during  partially driven by the continued deferral of the interest payments on the subordinated debentures 
capital expenditures during are expected to approximate million 
the increase over relates primarily to capital needs relative to the increase in sponge production at timet s henderson  nevada facility 
depreciation and amortization should approximate million in the company currently expects to make contributions of approximately million to its defined benefit pension plans during and expects its pension expense to approximate million in the year on year improvements in sales and operating income reflect achievements in many areas  most specifically with regard to vigorous cost and inventory reduction efforts  and the company will continue its focus on reducing costs in the company remains cautiously optimistic that the commercial aerospace industry has begun to improve and feels that with its strong balance sheet and improved cost structure  the company is well positioned to maximize profitability during any upturn 
additionally  solid growth is expected from sales into the industrial and emerging markets during  two areas in which the company s business is continuing to diversify 
non gaap financial measures 
in an effort to provide investors with information in addition to the company s results as determined by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  the company has provided the following non gaap financial disclosures that it believes may provide useful information to investors o the company discloses percentage changes in its mill and melted product selling prices in us dollars  which have been adjusted to exclude the effects of changes in product mix 
the company believes such disclosure provides useful information to investors by allowing them to analyze such changes without the impact of changes in product mix  thereby facilitating period to period comparisons of the relative changes in average selling prices 
depending on the composition of changes in product mix  the percentage change in selling prices excluding the effect of changes in product mix can be higher or lower than such percentage change would be using the actual product mix prevailing during the respective periods  o in addition to disclosing percentage changes in its mill product selling prices adjusted to exclude the effects of changes in product mix  the company also discloses such percentage changes in billing currencies  which have been further adjusted to exclude the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company believes such disclosure provides useful information to investors by allowing them to analyze such changes without the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  thereby facilitating period to period comparisons of the relative changes in average selling prices in the various actual billing currencies 
generally  when the us dollar strengthens weakens against other currencies  the percentage change in selling prices in billing currencies will be higher lower than such percentage changes would be using actual exchange rates prevailing during the respective periods  and o the company discloses operating income and net income excluding the impact of the boeing take or pay income 
the company believes this provides investors with useful information to better analyze the company s business and possible future earnings during periods after december   at which time the company will no longer receive the positive effects of the take or pay income 
liquidity and capital resources the company s consolidated cash flows for each of the past three years are presented below 
the following should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
year ended december  in thousands cash provided used by operating activities    investing activities    financing activities    net cash provided used by operating  investing and financing activities    operating activities 
the titanium industry historically has derived a substantial portion of its business from the aerospace industry 
the aerospace industry is cyclical  and changes in economic conditions within the aerospace industry significantly impact the company s earnings and operating cash flows 
cash flow from operations has been a primary source of the company s liquidity 
changes in titanium pricing  production volume and customer demand  among other things  could significantly affect the company s liquidity 
certain items included in the determination of net loss have an impact on cash flows from operating activities  but the impact of such items on cash may differ from their impact on net loss 
for example  pension expense and opeb expense will generally differ from the outflows of cash for payment of such benefits 
in addition  relative changes in assets and liabilities generally result from the timing of production  sales and purchases 
such relative changes can significantly impact the comparability of cash flow from operations from period to period  as the income statement impact of such items may occur in a different period than that in which the underlying cash transaction occurs 
for example  raw materials may be purchased in one period  but the cash payment for such raw materials may occur in a subsequent period 
similarly  inventory may be sold in one period  but the cash collection of the receivable may occur in a subsequent period 
net loss decreased from million for the year ended december   to million for the year ended december  see results of operations cumulative effect of change in accounting principle and note to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of the company s adoption of sfas no 
and the related effect on net loss for the year ended december  see results of operations non operating income expense and note to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of the company s impairment of its investment in smc securities and its effect on net loss for the years ended december  and accounts receivable decreased during primarily due to improved collection efforts with the company s customers  which resulted in a day decrease in days sales outstanding dso  from days at year end to days at year end  partially offset by the weakening of the us dollar compared to the british pound sterling and the euro 
accounts receivable decreased significantly during primarily as a result of reduced sales  partially offset by an increase in dso as certain customers extended their payment terms to the company in response to unfavorable economic conditions 
accounts receivable increased in principally as a result of increased sales 
inventories decreased during due to the company s concentrated focus on inventory reduction during inventories decreased during primarily as a result of reduced production in the fourth quarter of and an increase in the company s reserves for excess inventories  which the company recorded in response to decreased demand for its products and other changes in business conditions 
inventories increased in  reflecting material purchases and production rates that were based on expected sales levels higher than actual sales levels achieved 
due to the impact of the september  terrorist attacks  a number of customer order deferrals and cancellations were received late in  contributing to the inventory increase 
in april  the company reached a settlement of the litigation between timet and boeing 
pursuant to the settlement  the company received a cash payment of million million net of legal fees and in december received a million customer advance from boeing related to fiscal purchases 
this advance was reduced to million at the end of as a result of shipments and orders from boeing as well as the recognition of take or pay income 
the company received a million advance for in january through the company will receive a similar annual advance in january of the year to which the advance is related 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
dividends for the period october through december on the company s investment in smc convertible preferred securities were deferred by smc 
in april  smc resumed current dividend payments of million each quarter  however  dividends and interest in arrears were not paid 
on october   the company was notified by smc of smc s intention to again defer the payment of dividends effective with the dividend due on october  as previously discussed  the company recorded an impairment charge of million related to these securities  including accrued dividends and interest  in the fourth quarter of and ceased accruing dividend income on these securities at that time 
additionally  the company recorded a charge of million related to these securities in the first quarter of that reduced the carrying amount of these securities to zero 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company did not record any deferred income tax benefits related to its us or us losses during deferred income tax benefits recognized in primarily relate to increases in net deferred income tax assets of the company s french and italian subsidiaries 
the company did not record any deferred income tax benefits related to its us losses during deferred income tax benefits recognized in primarily relate to increases in net deferred income tax assets of the company s european subsidiaries 
deferred income taxes in were primarily due to an increase in the company s us deferred tax asset valuation allowance to offset previously recorded tax benefits that did not meet the more likely than not recognition criteria 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
as more fully discussed in results of operations non operating income expense  in october the company exercised its right to defer future interest payments on its subordinated debentures held by the capital trust  effective beginning with the company s december  scheduled interest payment  although interest continues to accrue at the coupon rate on the principal and unpaid interest 
in april  the company similarly exercised its right to defer future interest payments  and in the second quarter of  as noted above  a portion of the boeing settlement funds was used to pay the previously deferred aggregate interest of million and resume the regularly scheduled interest payments 
changes in accrued interest payable to the capital trust reflect this activity 
investing activities 
the company s capital expenditures were million in  million in and million in  principally for replacement of machinery and equipment and for capacity maintenance 
during the fourth quarter of  the company deposited funds into certificates of deposit and other interest bearing accounts as collateral for certain company obligations in lieu of entering into letters of credit 
these deposits  which are restricted as to the company s use  provide the company with interest income as opposed to interest expense incurred through the use of letters of credit 
financing activities 
cash used during related primarily to the company s million of net repayments on its outstanding borrowings upon the company s receipt of the million boeing advance in january additionally  timet savoie made a million dividend payment to cezus during cash provided during related primarily to net borrowings of million necessary to fulfill the company s working capital needs 
additionally  timet savoie made a million dividend payment to cezus during the company incurred approximately million in financing costs in conjunction with the company s amendment of its us revolving credit agreement in these costs are deferred and amortized over the life of the agreement  which matures in february see further discussion below in liquidity and capital resources borrowing arrangements 
cash used during related primarily to net repayments of million of indebtedness at the time of the company s litigation settlement with boeing 
borrowing arrangements 
under the terms of the company s us asset based revolving credit agreement  which matures in february  borrowings are limited to the lesser of million or a formula determined borrowing base derived from the value of accounts receivable  inventory and equipment borrowing availability 
this facility requires the company s us daily cash receipts to be used to reduce outstanding borrowings  which may then be reborrowed subject to the terms of the agreement 
interest generally accrues at rates that vary from libor plus to libor plus 
borrowings are collateralized by substantially all of the company s us assets 
the credit agreement prohibits the payment of distributions in respect of the capital trust s bucs if excess availability  as defined  is less than million  limits additional indebtedness  prohibits the payment of dividends on the company s common stock if excess availability is less than million  requires compliance with certain financial covenants and contains other covenants customary in lending transactions of this type 
the company was in compliance in all material respects with all covenants for all periods during the years ended december  and excess availability is defined as borrowing availability less outstanding borrowings and certain contractual commitments such as letters of credit 
at december   excess availability was approximately million 
there were no outstanding borrowings under the us credit agreement as of december  the weighted average interest rate on borrowings outstanding under this credit agreement as of december  was the company s us credit agreement allows the lender to modify the borrowing base formulas at its discretion  subject to certain conditions 
during the second quarter of  the company s lender elected to exercise such discretion and modified the company s borrowing base formulas  which reduced the amount that the company could have borrowed against its inventory and equipment by approximately million 
in the event the lender were to exercise this discretion again in the future  such event could have a material adverse impact on the company s liquidity 
borrowings outstanding under this us facility are classified as a current liability 
the company s subsidiary  timet uk  has a credit agreement that provides for borrowings limited to the lesser of pound million or a formula determined borrowing base derived from the value of accounts receivable  inventory and property  plant and equipment borrowing availability 
the credit agreement includes revolving and term loan facilities and an overdraft facility the uk facilities and matures in december borrowings under the uk facilities can be in various currencies including uk dollars  british pounds sterling and euros 
borrowings accrue interest at rates that vary from libor plus to libor plus and are collateralized by substantially all of timet uk s assets 
the uk facilities require the maintenance of certain financial ratios and amounts and other covenants customary in lending transactions of this type 
timet uk was in compliance in all material respects with all covenants for all periods during the years ended december  and the uk overdraft facility is subject to annual review in december of each year 
in the event the overdraft facility is not renewed  the company believes it could refinance any outstanding overdraft borrowings under either the revolving or term loan features of the uk facilities 
the overdraft facility was reviewed and renewed in december during the second quarter of  timet uk received an interest bearing intercompany loan from a us subsidiary of the company enabling timet uk to reduce its long term borrowings under the uk facilities to zero 
unused borrowing availability at december  under the uk facilities was approximately million 
there were no borrowings outstanding under the uk facilities as of december  the weighted average interest rate on borrowings outstanding under the uk facilities as of december  was 
the company also has overdraft and other credit facilities at certain of its other european subsidiaries 
these facilities accrue interest at various rates and are payable on demand 
unused borrowing availability at december  under these facilities was approximately million 
there were no borrowings outstanding under the other european facilities as of december  the weighted average interest rate on borrowings outstanding under these credit agreements as of december  was 
although excess availability under timet s us credit agreement remains above million  no dividends were paid by timet on its common stock during  or timet does not anticipate paying dividends on its common stock during and  as previously discussed  is not permitted to pay such dividends while deferring interest payments on the subordinated debentures held by the capital trust 
contractual commitments 
as more fully described in notes   and to the consolidated financial statements  the company was a party to various debt  lease and other agreements at december  that contractually and unconditionally commit the company to pay certain amounts in the future 
the following table summarizes such contractual commitments that are unconditional both in terms of timing and amount by the type and date of payment 
unconditional payment due date after total contractual commitment in thousands capital leases   operating leases    debt payable to capital trust and accrued interest thereon    purchase obligations     other contractual obligations     excludes interest payments due under the capital lease agreements 
inclusive of these interest payments  the total contractual commitment is million million in  million in  million in and million in and thereafter 
represents the company s subordinated debentures purchased by the capital trust from timet in connection with the capital trust s issuance of the bucs and total interest accrued on the subordinated debentures at december  under the indenture related to the subordinated debentures  the currently deferred interest payments may continue to be contractually deferred until december  based on an average price and an assumed constant mix of products purchased  where appropriate 
the company has excluded any potential commitment for funding of retirement and postretirement benefit plans from this table 
however  such potential future contributions are discussed below  as appropriate  in liquidity and capital resources defined benefit pension plans and liquidity and capital resources postretirement benefit plans other than pensions 
off balance sheet arrangements 
as more fully discussed in results of operations non operating income expense  the company is the primary obligor on two million workers compensation bonds issued on behalf of freedom forge 
the company has fully expensed the obligation under one of the bonds  but based upon current claims analysis  the company has only expensed million on the other bond  although it is potentially obligated for the remaining million 
defined benefit pension plans 
as of december   the company maintains three defined benefit pension plans one each in the us  the us and france 
prior to december   the us maintained two plans  which were merged as of that date 
the majority of the discussion below relates to the us and us plans  as the french plan is not material to the company s consolidated balance sheets  statements of operations or statements of cash flows 
the company recorded consolidated pension expense of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
pension expense for these periods was calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions  most significant of which are the discount rate and the expected long term rate of return 
the discount rate the company utilizes for determining pension expense and pension obligations is based on a review of long term bonds to year maturities that receive one of the two highest ratings given by recognized rating agencies generally merrill lynch  moody s  solomon smith barney and ubs warburg as well as composite indices provided by the company s actuaries 
changes in the company s discount rate over the past three years reflect the decline in such bond rates during that period 
the company establishes a rate that is used to determine obligations as of the year end date and expense for the subsequent year 
the company used the following discount rate assumptions for its pension plans discount rates used for obligation at obligation at obligation at december  december  december  and expense in and expense in and expense in us plan s uk plan in developing the company s expected long term rate of return assumptions  the company evaluates historical market rates of return and input from its actuaries  including a review of asset class return expectations as well as long term inflation assumptions 
projected returns are based on broad equity large cap  small cap and international and bond corporate and government indices as well as anticipation that the plans active investment managers will generate premiums above the standard market projections 
the company used the following long term rate of return assumptions for its pension plans long term rates of return used for obligation at obligation at obligation at december  december  december  and expense in and expense in and expense in us plan s uk plan lowering the expected long term rate of return on the company s us plans assets by from to would have increased pension expense by approximately million  and lowering the discount rate assumption by from to would similarly have increased the company s us plans pension expense by approximately million 
lowering the expected long term rate of return on the company s uk plan s assets by from to would have increased pension expense by approximately million  and lowering the discount rate assumption by from to would have increased the company s uk plan s pension expense by approximately million 
based on continued market declines and losses on the plan assets during  as well as future projected asset mix  the company reduced its assumed long term rate of return for to for its us plans and for its uk plan 
the company s future expected long term rate of return on plan assets for its us and us plans at december  was based on an asset allocation assumption of equity securities and fixed income securities 
however  because of market fluctuations and prior funding strategies  actual asset allocation as of december  was equity securities  fixed income securities and cash for the us plans and equity securities  fixed income securities and cash for the uk plan 
during the second quarter of  the company transferred all of its us plans assets into the combined master retirement trust cmrt 
the cmrt is a collective investment trust established by valhi to permit the collective investment by certain master trusts which fund certain employee benefits plans sponsored by valhi and certain related companies 
the cmrt held of timet common stock at december   however  the company s plan assets are invested only in a portion of the cmrt that does not hold timet common stock 
at december   valhi and related entities or persons held approximately of timet s outstanding common stock and approximately of the capital trust s outstanding bucs which are convertible into timet common stock 
harold c 
simmons  chairman of the board of directors for valhi  is the sole trustee of the cmrt and a member of the trust investment committee for the cmrt 
the cmrt s long term investment objective is to provide a rate of return exceeding a composite of broad market equity and fixed income indices including the s p and certain russell indices utilizing both third party investment managers as well as investments directed by mr 
simmons 
during the year history of the cmrt from inception in through december   the average annual rate of return earned by the cmrt  as calculated based on the average percentage change in the cmrt s net asset value per cmrt unit for each applicable year  was 
the cmrt earned an annual return of in  and the cmrt s last year and year average annual returns were and  respectively 
the cmrt s annual rates of return from inception through december  have varied from a high of a return in to a low of a loss in 
during that same period  the s p s annual rates of return have varied from a high of a return in to a low of a loss in 
the company believes that such historical volatility is a reasonable indicator of future levels of volatility  and a higher level of volatility is consistent with a higher level of risk in the asset mix and a higher level of expected return over the long term 
at december   the cmrt s asset mix based on an aggregate asset value of million was us equity securities  foreign equity securities  debt securities and cash and other 
the cmrt s trustee and investment committee actively manage the investments within the cmrt 
such parties have in the past  and may again in the future  periodically change the relative asset mix based upon  among other things  advice they receive from third party advisors and their expectation as to what asset mix will generate the greatest overall return 
based on the above  the company increased its long term rate of return assumption to for december  pension obligations and for pension expense for its us plan 
based on various factors  including improved economic and market conditions  gains on the plan assets during and projected asset mix  the company increased its assumed long term rate of return for december  pension obligations and for pension expense to for its uk plan 
because of market fluctuations and prior funding strategies  actual asset allocation as of december  was equity securities and fixed income securities for the uk plan 
during  the trustees for the uk plan selected a new investment advisor effective in for the uk plan and modified its asset allocation goals 
as such  the company s future expected long term rate of return on plan assets for its uk plan is based on an asset allocation assumption of equity securities and fixed income securities by the end of and equity securities and fixed income securities by the end of the company believes that the plans long term asset allocation on average will approximate the ultimate assumed allocation  as all current contributions to the plan are invested wholly in fixed income securities in order to gradually effect the shift 
although the expected rate of return is a long term measure  the company will continue to evaluate its expected rate of return  at least annually  and will adjust it as considered necessary 
among other things  the company bases its determination of pension expense for all plans on the fair value of plan assets 
the expected return on the fair value of the plan assets  determined based on the expected long term rate of return  is a component of pension expense 
this methodology further recognizes actual investment gains or losses ie  the difference between the expected and actual returns based on the market value of assets in pension expense through amortization in future periods based upon the expected average remaining service life of the plan participants 
unrealized gains or losses may impact future periods to the extent the accumulated gains or losses are outside the corridor as defined by sfas no 
based on an expected rate of return on plan assets of  a discount rate of and various other assumptions  the company estimates that its us plan will have pension expense of approximately million in and pension income of approximately million in and million in a increase decrease in the discount rate would decrease increase projected pension expense by approximately million in and increase decease projected pension income by approximately million in and a increase decrease in the long term rate of return would decrease increase projected pension expense by approximately million in and increase decrease projected pension income by approximately million in and approximately million in based on an expected rate of return on plan assets of  a discount rate of and various other assumptions including an exchange rate of pound  the company estimates that pension expense for its uk plan will approximate million in  million in and million in a increase decrease in the discount rate would decrease increase projected pension expense by approximately million in and million in and a increase decrease in the long term rate of return would decrease increase projected pension expense by approximately million in  million in and million in actual future pension expense will depend on actual future investment performance  changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the populations participating in the company s pension plans 
the company made cash contributions of approximately million in  million in and million in to the us plans and cash contributions of approximately million in  million in and million in to the uk plan 
based upon the current underfunded status of the plans and the actuarial assumptions being used for  the company believes that it will be required to make the following cash contributions exclusive of any required employee contributions over the next five years projected cash contributions us plan us plan total in millions year ending december  the value of the plans assets has fluctuated dramatically over the past three years based mainly on performance of the plans equity securities 
the us plans assets were million  million and million at december   and  respectively  and the uk plan s assets were million  million and million at december   and  respectively 
the combination of actual investment returns and changing discount rates has a significant effect on the company s funded plan status plan assets compared to projected benefit obligations 
in  the effect of positive investment returns was only partially offset by the decline in the discount rate  thereby reducing the underfunded status of the us plan to million at december  in  the effect of positive investment returns in the uk plan was more than offset by the decline in the discount rate and the effect of the weakening dollar compared to the british pound sterling  thereby increasing the underfunded status of the uk plan to million at december  the us and us plans were underfunded by million and million  respectively  at december  based upon the change in the funded status of the plans during  the company was required to record a net additional minimum pension liability credit net of tax to equity of million  reflecting additional comprehensive income of million for the us plan and additional comprehensive loss of million related to the uk plan 
postretirement benefit plans other than pensions 
the company provides limited postretirement healthcare and life insurance opeb benefits to a portion of its us employees upon retirement 
the company funds such opeb benefits as they are incurred  net of any retiree contributions 
the company paid opeb benefits  net of retiree contributions  in the amount of million  million and million during  and  respectively 
the company recorded consolidated opeb expense of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
opeb expense for these periods was calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions  most significant of which are the discount rate and the expected long term health care trend rate 
the discount rate the company utilizes for determining opeb expense and opeb obligations is the same as that used for the company s us pension plans 
lowering the discount rate assumption by from to would have increased the company s opeb expense by less than million 
the company estimates the expected long term health care trend rate based upon input from specialists in this area  as provided by the company s actuaries 
in estimating the health care trend rate  the company considers industry trends  the company s actual healthcare cost experience and the company s future benefit structure 
for  the company used a beginning health care trend rate of  which is projected to reduce to an ultimate rate of in if the health care trend rate changed by for each year  opeb expense would have increased decreased by approximately million in for  the company is using a beginning health care trend rate of  which is projected to reduce to an ultimate rate of in based on a discount rate of  a health care trend rate as discussed above and various other assumptions  the company estimates that opeb expense will approximate million in  million in and million in a increase decrease in the discount rate would decrease increase projected opeb expense by less than million in  and a increase decrease in the health care trend rate for each year would increase decrease the projected service and interest cost components of opeb expense by approximately million in  and environmental matters

critical accounting policies and estimates the company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments  and select from a range of possible estimates and assumptions  that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable  inventory allowances  asset lives  impairments of investments in preferred securities and investments accounted for by the equity method  the recoverability of other long lived assets  including property and equipment  goodwill and other intangible assets  pension and other post retirement benefit obligations and the related underlying actuarial assumptions  the realization of deferred income tax assets  and accruals for asset retirement obligations  environmental remediation  litigation  income tax and other contingencies 
the company bases its estimates and judgments  to varying degrees  on historical experience  advice of external specialists and various other factors it believes to be prudent under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from previously estimated amounts and such estimates  assumptions and judgments are regularly subject to revision 
the policies and estimates discussed below are considered by management to be critical to an understanding of the company s financial statements because their application requires the most significant judgments from management in estimating matters for financial reporting that are inherently uncertain 
see notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on these policies and estimates  as well as discussion of additional accounting policies and estimates 
inventory allowances 
the company values approximately one half of its inventory using the lifo method with the remainder stated primarily using an average cost method 
the company periodically reviews its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory and records any write down equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and its estimated net realizable value based upon assumptions about alternative uses  market conditions and other factors 
impairment of long lived assets 
generally  when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of long lived assets  including property and equipment  goodwill and other intangible assets  may not be recoverable  the company prepares an evaluation of the assets or asset group 
if this evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of the asset or asset group is not recoverable  the amount of the impairment would typically be calculated using discounted expected future cash flows or appraised values 
all relevant factors are considered in determining whether an impairment exists 
in  no such events or circumstances indicated the need to perform such evaluation 
during the fourth quarter of  the company completed an entity wide impairment assessment in response to continued poor conditions in the commercial aerospace market 
in order to complete this assessment  the company identified its lowest level of identifiable cash flows  resulting in the identification of four asset groups us  us  france and italy 
of these asset groups  italy is not reliant on sales into the commercial aerospace market and therefore an analysis of its potential impairment was not considered necessary 
the result of this assessment led the company to conclude that there was no impairment related to the long lived assets in the three asset groups tested  as the undiscounted cash flows exceeded the net carrying value of the applicable net assets in each of the three asset groups 
although management utilizes certain external information sources such as the airline monitor as the basis for aerospace sales volume projections  significant management judgment is required in estimating other factors that are material to future cash flows including  but not limited to  customer demand  the company s market position  selling prices  competitive forces and manufacturing costs 
future cash flows are inherently uncertain  and there can be no assurance that the company will achieve the future cash flows reflected in its projections 
the company also completed an impairment assessment of its goodwill and intangible assets under sfas no 
 during  as discussed in results of operations cumulative effect of change in accounting principle and note to the consolidated financial statements 
management judgment was required in order to identify the company s reporting units  determine the carrying amount of each reporting unit by assigning its assets and liabilities  including existing goodwill and intangible assets  to those reporting units as of january   and determine the implied fair value of its goodwill 
this evaluation  which was completed with the assistance of an external valuation specialist and considered a combination of fair value indicators including quoted market prices  prices of comparable businesses and discounted projected cash flows  indicated that the company s recorded goodwill might be impaired and required the company to complete the second step of the impairment test 
based on the results of the impairment test  the company recorded a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million  representing the entire balance of the company s recorded goodwill at january  valuation and impairment of securities 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  the company evaluates its investments in debt and equity securities whenever events or conditions occur to indicate that the fair value of such investments has declined below their carrying amounts 
if the decline in fair value is judged to be other than temporary  the carrying amount of the security is written down to fair value 
in response to certain events previously described in this md a  the company undertook assessments in the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of of its investment in smc with the assistance of an external valuation specialist 
those assessments indicated that it was unlikely that the company would recover its then existing carrying amount of the smc securities in accordance with the securities contractual terms and that an other than temporary decline in the fair value of its investment had occurred 
accordingly  the company recorded impairment charges of million in the fourth quarter of and million in the first quarter of the securities were not publicly traded and  accordingly  quoted market prices were unavailable 
the estimate of fair value required significant judgment and considered a number of factors including  but not limited to  the financial health and prospects of smc and market yields of comparable securities 
deferred income tax valuation allowances 
under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  and related guidance  the company is required to record a valuation allowance if realization of deferred tax assets is not more likely than not 
substantial weight must be given to recent historical results and near term projections  and management must assess the availability of tax planning strategies that might impact either the need for  or amount of  any valuation allowance 
as more fully discussed in results of operations income taxes  the company has concluded that realization of its previously recorded us and us deferred tax assets does not meet the more likely than not recognition criteria 
additionally  the company has determined that it will not recognize deferred tax benefits related to future us or us losses or future increases in the us or us minimum pension liabilities continuing for an uncertain period of time 
accordingly  the company increased its deferred tax valuation allowance in through to offset deferred tax benefits related to net us deferred tax assets and in and to offset deferred tax benefits related to net uk deferred tax assets 
regular reviews of the more likely than not criteria and availability of tax planning strategies will continue to require significant management judgment 
pension and opeb expenses and obligations 
the company s pension and opeb expenses and obligations are calculated based on several estimates  including discount rates  expected rates of returns on plan assets and expected health care trend rates 
the company reviews these rates annually with the assistance of its actuaries 
see further discussion of the factors considered and potential effect of these estimates in liquidity and capital resources defined benefit pension plans and liquidity and capital resources postretirement benefit plans other than pensions 
revenue recognition 
sales revenue is generally recognized when the company has certified that its product meets the related customer specifications  the product has been shipped  and title and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer 
payments received from customers in advance of these criteria being met are recorded as customer advances until earned 
amounts charged to customers for shipping and handling are included in net sales 
sales revenue is stated net of price and early payment discounts 
other loss contingencies 
accruals for estimated loss contingencies  including  but not limited to  product related liabilities  environmental remediation and litigation  are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
disclosure is made when there is a reasonable possibility that a loss may have been incurred 
contingent liabilities are often resolved over long time periods 
estimating probable losses often requires analysis of various projections that are dependent upon the future outcome of multiple factors  including costs  the findings of investigations and actions by the company and third parties 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rates 
the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates related to indebtedness 
the company typically does not enter into interest rate swaps or other types of contracts in order to manage its interest rate market risk 
at december   the company had no bank indebtedness 
at december  all of the company s bank indebtedness was denominated in us dollars  british pounds sterling or euros and bore interest at variable rates  primarily related to spreads over libor 
because the company s bank indebtedness reprices with changes in market interest rates  the carrying amount of such debt is believed to approximate fair value 
the following table summarizes the company s bank indebtedness and related maturities as of december  contractual maturity date interest rate in millions variable rate debt u

dollar denominated amounts are translated at year end rates of exchange 
weighted average 
the million subordinated debentures held by the capital trust provide a fixed coupon and are exposed to market risk from changing interest rates 
at december   accrued but unpaid interest on the subordinated debentures was million 
the bucs issued by the capital trust are publicly traded  and the company believes they provide the best available proxy for the fair value of the underlying subordinated debentures 
based upon the last traded value of the bucs on or before december   the fair value of the subordinated debentures  including the accrued and unpaid interest  approximated million at december  foreign currency exchange rates 
the company is exposed to market risk arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of its international operations 
the company typically does not enter into currency forward contracts to manage its foreign exchange market risk associated with receivables  payables or indebtedness denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the particular entity

commodity prices 
the company is exposed to market risk arising from changes in commodity prices as a result of its long term purchase and supply agreements with certain suppliers and customers 
these agreements  which offer various fixed or formula determined pricing arrangements  effectively obligate the company to bear i the risk of increased raw material and other costs to the company that cannot be passed on to the company s customers through increased titanium product prices in whole or in part or ii the risk of decreasing raw material costs to the company s suppliers that are not passed on to the company in the form of lower raw material prices
