on march   the company s board of directors  together with the board of directors of merant plc 
merant  announced that they had reached agreement on the terms of a recommended cash and share offer the offer to be made by the company and by lehman brothers on its behalf outside of the united states for the entire issue and to be issued share capital of merant  including merant shares represented by merant adss american depository shares 
the offer was made on march  if completed  the acquisition will create the second largest provider of enterprise change management ecm software solutions  serving the complex change management needs of at least of the fortune largest companies worldwide  with a resulting combined install base of over  customers 
see note b of notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion on the merant acquisition 
the offer is pence for each merant share to be satisfied by pence in cash and of a new serena share 
this is based on an exchange rate of us gbp and a price per serena share of us 
the company is offering a mix and match election under which merant seurityholders who validly accept the offer may request to vary the proportions in which they receive serena shares and cash in respect of their merant shares 
at pence for each merant share  and given the exchange rate and serena share price noted above  the offer values the entire issued share capital of merant at approximately gbp million us million

to a form s registration statement form s a under the securities act of on april   the company filed with the securities and exchange commission a pre effective amendment no 
to a form s registration statement form s a under the securities act of serena experienced an increase in total revenues as total revenues increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal in the two fiscal years ended january  and  serena had experienced decreases in total revenue as total revenues went from million in fiscal to million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the overall demand for the company s software depends in large part on general and economic business conditions 
the general weakening of the worldwide economy and resulting slowdown in it spending contributed to the overall decrease in total revenues 

table of contents 
index to financial statements prior to fiscal  serena had grown rapidly as total revenue increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the growth in total revenue has been primarily attributable to increased demand for our mainframe products  and to a lesser extent beginning in the second half of fiscal  the introduction of our distributed systems products  primarily changeman ds  into the marketplace 
in general  demand had been increasing as a result of greater awareness of and need for automated third party scm solutions 
we derive our revenue from software licenses  maintenance and professional services 
in fiscal  of our software license revenue was derived from our mainframe products and from our distributed systems products 
customers typically purchase the mainframe products under million instructions per second  or mips based  perpetual licenses 
mainframe software products and applications are usually priced based on hardware computing capacity 
mips is a capacity measurement used by hardware manufacturers to rate computer size to determine the amount of capacity for running applications and supporting users 
the higher a hardware s mips capacity  the more expensive a software license will be 
customers increasing their mips capacity are required to purchase an additional software license when upgrading the hardware 
our distributed systems products are licensed on a per user seat basis 
software products are also typically priced based on a perpetual license agreement  which entitles a customer to use the product on an ongoing basis 
initial mainframe license transactions generally include one year of software maintenance and support 
any factors adversely affecting the pricing of  demand for or market acceptance of our mainframe or distributed systems products  such as competition or technological change  could materially adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
see factors that may affect future results we have relied and expect to continue to rely on sales of our mainframe products for our revenue and our business is dependent on the continued market for ibm and ibm compatible mainframes 
we also provide ongoing maintenance  which includes technical support  version upgrades and enhancements  for an annual fee of approximately to of the discounted list price of the licensed product 
we recognize maintenance revenue over the term of the maintenance contract on a straight line basis 
professional services revenue is derived from consulting and educational services  including implementation and integration of licensed software  specialized consulting services such as best practices design  development and deployment of scm solutions  and education courses for serena s products 
our professional services are typically billed on a time and materials basis and revenue is recognized as the related services are performed 
maintenance revenue and professional services revenue have lower gross profit margins than software license revenue as a result of costs inherent in operating our customer support and professional services organizations 
historically  serena s revenue has primarily been attributable to sales in north america 
revenue attributable to sales in north america accounted for approximately in fiscal and in both fiscal and fiscal of serena s total revenue 
our international revenue is attributable principally to our european operations 
international sales represented approximately of our total revenue in fiscal and in both fiscal and fiscal international revenue growth in fiscal  when compared to  and in fiscal  when compared to  was and  respectively 
the increase in international sales as a percentage of total revenue in fiscal and the international revenue growth rate increase in fiscal are both the result of several large transactions with one international customer in fiscal this single customer accounted for of total revenue in fiscal no single customer accounted for or more of total revenue in fiscal or we anticipate that international revenue will increase as a percentage of total revenue in the future when overseas economic conditions improve 
any expansion of our international operations will be subject to a variety of risks that could materially adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
see factors that may affect future results we intend to expand our international operations and may encounter a number of problems in doing so  there are also a number of factors associated with international operations that could adversely affect our business 
in north america  serena s revenue is 
table of contents 
index to financial statements generally denominated in united states dollars while international sales are generally denominated in local currencies  principally the british pound and euro 
should serena s international sales and operations expand  we anticipate that our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations will increase 
see factors that may affect future results fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies could result in currency transaction losses for serena 
we expect operating expenses to increase in the future as we continue to develop new and enhanced versions of our products  including our distributed systems product suite  increase our sales and marketing activities  expand our distribution channels  and pursue strategic relationships and acquisitions 
any failure by serena to significantly increase revenue as we implement these initiatives could materially adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
see factors that may affect future results we expect that our operating expenses will increase in the future and these increased expenses may adversely affect our future operating results and financial condition 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgements that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
in many instances  we could have reasonably used different accounting estimates  and in other instances changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 
accordingly  actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by us 
to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results  our future financial statement presentation of our financial condition or results of operations could be affected 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgements  including those related to revenue recognition  trade accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts  impairment or disposal of long lived assets  and accounting for income taxes  among other things 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
we refer to accounting estimates of this type as critical accounting policies  which are discussed further below 
in addition to these estimates and assumptions that are utilized in the preparation of historical financial statements  the inability to properly estimate the timing and amount of future revenues could significantly affect our future operations 
we must make assumptions and estimates as to the timing and amount of future revenue 
specifically  our sales personnel monitor the status of all proposals  including the estimated closing date and potential dollar amount of such transactions 
we aggregate these estimates periodically to generate a sales pipeline and then evaluate the pipeline to identify trends in our business 
this pipeline analysis and related estimates of revenue may differ significantly from actual revenues in a particular reporting period as the estimates and assumptions were made using the best available data at the time  which is subject to change 
specifically  the slowdown in the global economy and information technology spending has caused and may continue to cause customer purchasing decisions to be delayed  reduced in amount or cancelled  all of which have reduced and could continue to reduce the rate of conversion of the pipeline into contracts 
a variation in the pipeline or the conversion rate of the pipeline into contracts could cause us to plan or budget inaccurately and thereby could adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  because a substantial portion of our software license contracts close in the latter part of a quarter  we may not be able to adjust our cost structure to respond to a variation in the conversion of the pipeline in a timely manner  and thereby the delays may adversely and materially affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 

table of contents 
index to financial statements we believe the following are critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
serena recognizes revenues in accordance with sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  and recognizes revenues when all of the following criteria are met as set forth in paragraph of sop persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
for contracts with multiple elements eg  license and maintenance  revenue is allocated to each component of the contract based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of its fair value  which is the price charged when the elements are sold separately 
since vsoe has not been established for license transactions  the residual method is used to allocate revenue to the license portion of multiple element transactions 
the company sells its products to its end users and distributors under license agreements 
each new mainframe license includes maintenance  which includes the right to receive telephone support  bug fixes and unspecified upgrades and enhancements  for a specified duration of time  usually one year 
the fee associated with such agreements is allocated between software license revenue and maintenance revenue based on the residual method 
software license revenue from these agreements is recognized upon receipt and acceptance of a signed contract and delivery of the software  provided the related fee is fixed and determinable  collectibility of the revenue is probable and the arrangement does not involve significant customization of the software 
if an acceptance period is required  revenue is recognized upon the earlier of customer acceptance or the expiration of the acceptance period  as defined in the applicable software license agreement 
the company recognizes maintenance revenue ratably over the life of the related maintenance contract 
maintenance contracts on perpetual licenses generally renew annually 
the company typically invoices and collects maintenance fees on an annual basis at the anniversary date of the license 
deferred revenue represents amounts received by the company in advance of performance of the maintenance obligation 
professional services revenue includes fees derived from the delivery of training  installation  and consulting services 
revenue from training  installation  and consulting services is recognized on a time and materials basis as the related services are performed 
these services do not involve significant production  modification or customization of the software and the services are not essential to the functionality of the software 
trade accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts 
trade accounts receivable are recorded net of allowance for doubtful accounts 
we regularly review the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts through identification of specific receivables where we expect that payment will likely not be received  and we have established a general reserve policy that is applied to all amounts that are not specifically identified 
the allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate as of the reporting dates 
changes may occur in the future  which may make us reassess the collectibility of amounts and at which time we may need to provide additional allowances in excess of that currently provided 
impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the company adopted sfas no 
on february  the adoption of sfas no 
did not affect the company s financial statements 
in accordance with sfas no 
 long lived assets  such as property  plant and equipment  and purchased intangibles subject to amortization  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell  and are no longer depreciated 
the assets and 
table of contents 
index to financial statements liabilities of a disposed group classified as held for sale would be presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance sheet 
to date  there has been no significant impairment of long lived assets and the company does not expect to record an impairment loss on its long lived assets in the near future 
goodwill is tested annually for impairment  and is tested for impairment more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset s fair value 
this determination is made at the reporting unit level and consists of two steps 
first  the company determines the fair value of a reporting unit and compares it to its carrying amount 
second  if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill 
the company completed this test during the fourth quarters of fiscal and fiscal  and the company is not required to record an impairment loss on goodwill 
accounting for income taxes 
income taxes are recorded using the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date

software licenses revenue was million  million and million in fiscal  and  representing  and of total revenue  respectively 
software licenses revenue decreased million or from fiscal to and increased million or from fiscal to the decrease in fiscal  when compared to fiscal  is generally attributable to a slowdown in it spending across all products as a result of the continuing weak economic conditions in both the us and europe and  to a lesser extent delays experienced in executing certain sales transactions  all partially offset by increases 
table of contents 
index to financial statements in our startool family of products license revenue due to a large startool transaction with a single international customer in the third quarter of fiscal  and to a lessor extent  increases in our distributed systems license revenue 
the increase in fiscal  when compared to fiscal  is generally attributable to increases in our distributed systems license revenue  in part fueled by new sales of teamtrack coming from our teamshare acquisition in the second quarter of fiscal  all partially offset by a decrease in the startool family of products license revenue 
in particular  sales of our changeman zmf  changeman ds  teamtrack and comparex products continue to make up a significant portion of our total software licenses revenue 
combined  they accounted for million  million and million in fiscal  and  representing  and of total software licenses revenue  respectively 
sales of our distributed systems products  predominantly changeman ds prior to fiscal and both changeman ds and teamtrack beginning in fiscal  make up an increasing proportion of total software licenses revenue 
distributed systems products accounted for million or of total software licenses revenue in fiscal as compared to million or and million or in fiscal and  respectively 
the company expects that its distributed systems revenues will increase  and that changeman zmf  changeman ds  teamtrack and comparex will continue to account for a substantial portion of software licenses revenue in the future 
we may experience slower growth in license revenue in the near term 
maintenance 
maintenance revenue was million  million and million in fiscal  and  representing  and of total revenue  respectively 
maintenance revenue increased million or from fiscal to and million or from fiscal to the dollar increases reflect consistent renewal rates and growth in installed software licenses base  as new licenses generally include one year of maintenance  renewals of maintenance agreements by existing customers and  to a lesser extent  maintenance price increases  all partially offset by some cancellations in comparex maintenance contracts  particularly beginning in fiscal maintenance revenue as a percentage of total revenue has increased annually as a result of continued growth and a decline in the rate of license revenue growth from the general weakening of the economy and the slowdown in it spending which began predominantly in the second quarter of fiscal we expect maintenance revenue to grow slightly in absolute dollars in the near term 
professional services 
professional services revenue was million  million and million in fiscal  and  representing  and of total revenue  respectively 
professional services revenue decreased million or from fiscal to and increased million or from fiscal to the dollar decrease in fiscal when compared to fiscal is predominantly the result of a weak us economy which generated declining license revenues and therefore fewer consulting opportunities and the deferral of existing consulting projects all beginning more specifically in the second quarter of fiscal the dollar and percentage increase in fiscal when compared to fiscal is predominantly due to an improvement in our consulting business which began in the second quarter of fiscal fueled in part by an increased number of large engagements 
in general  professional services revenue is attributable to consulting opportunities resulting from our installed customer base and our expanded consulting service capabilities  all partially offset by price pressures on consulting rates  and the deferral of existing consulting projects 
we may experience little or no growth in professional services revenue in the near term 
cost of revenue cost of revenue  which consists of cost of software licenses  cost of maintenance and cost of professional services  was million  million and million in fiscal  and  representing  and of total revenue  respectively 
cost of revenue decreased million or from fiscal to and increased million or from fiscal to as a percentage of total revenue  cost of revenue has increased slightly year over year predominantly due to margin declines in professional services due to the general weakening of the economy and price pressures on consulting rates  and to a lessor extent a decline in the cost of software licenses margin in fiscal over software licenses 
cost of software licenses consists principally of fees associated with our startool fdm product through the second quarter of fiscal  and to a lesser extent  salaries  bonuses and other costs

cost of software licenses increased million or from fiscal to and decreased million or from fiscal to the increase in absolute dollar terms and as a percentage of total software licenses revenue in fiscal  when compared to fiscal  is the result of certain referral fees incurred for the first time in fiscal associated with license revenue in europe  and to a lesser extent  fees associated with integrating third party technology into our changeman ds products as those products represented a larger portion of total software licenses revenue in fiscal the decrease in absolute dollar terms and as a percentage of total software licenses revenue in fiscal  when compared to fiscal  is primarily due to the elimination of royalties related to our startool fdm product beginning in the third quarter of fiscal maintenance 
cost of maintenance consists primarily of salaries  bonuses and other costs associated with our customer support organizations 
cost of maintenance was million  million and million in fiscal  and  representing  and of total maintenance revenue  respectively 
cost of maintenance increased million or from fiscal to and increased million or from fiscal to the dollar increases are predominantly due to increases in salaries  benefits and other employee related expenses associated with our customer support organizations as a result of the growth in support personnel headcount to support growth in both maintenance revenue and our installed customer base 
professional services 
cost of professional services consists of salaries  bonuses and other costs associated with supporting our professional services organization 
cost of professional services was million  million and million in fiscal  and  representing  and of total professional services revenue  respectively 
cost of professional services decreased million or from fiscal to and increased million or from fiscal to the dollar decrease in fiscal when compared to fiscal is predominantly due to cost savings initiatives put in place beginning in the third quarter of fiscal and general cost reductions associated with the decline in our professional services revenue base 
the dollar increase in fiscal when compared to fiscal is predominantly due to an increase in salaries  benefits and other employee related expenses associated with our professional services organization to support higher professional services revenue and increases in third party contractor costs 
as a percentage of total professional services revenues  the cost of professional services increased annually predominantly due to the continued weak us economy  price pressures on consulting rates and increases in third party contractor costs 
operating expenses sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and bonuses  payroll taxes and employee benefits as well as travel  entertainment and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses were million  million and million in fiscal  and  representing  and of total revenue  respectively 
sales and marketing expenses decreased million or from fiscal to and increased million or from fiscal to the dollar decrease in fiscal  when compared to fiscal  was predominantly due to the continuation of the cost savings initiatives put in place as part of the company s restructuring plans announced early in the third quarter of fiscal the dollar increase in fiscal  when compared to fiscal  is due primarily to the expansion of our direct sales and marketing organizations to support license revenue growth  and to a lesser extent  salary  benefits and other employee related cost increases associated with our teamshare acquisition in the second quarter of fiscal in fiscal  when compared to fiscal  sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenue decreased as the rate of decrease in sales and marketing expenses  which in fiscal included a full year s benefit of the cost containment measures associated with the company s restructuring plans put in place in the third quarter of fiscal  was greater than the rate of decrease in total revenues 
in fiscal  when compared to fiscal  sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenue increased slightly as the rate of growth in sales and marketing expenses  in part fueled by the teamshare 
table of contents

in absolute dollar terms  we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase as we continue to hire additional sales and marketing personnel  market our distributed systems products and undertake additional marketing programs 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries  bonuses  payroll taxes and employee benefits and costs attributable to research and development activities 
research and development expenses were million  million and million in fiscal  and  representing  and of total revenue  respectively 
research and development expenses decreased million or from fiscal to and increased million or from fiscal to the dollar decrease in fiscal  when compared to fiscal  was predominantly due to the continuation of the cost savings initiatives put in place as part of the company s restructuring plans announced early in the third quarter of fiscal the dollar increase in fiscal  when compared to fiscal  was primarily due to increased costs generally associated with the expansion of our research and development efforts to enhance existing products and develop our distributed systems products and the company s acquisition of teamshare in the second quarter of fiscal we expect research and development expenses to increase  both in absolute dollar terms and as a percentage of total revenue  as we continue to hire additional research and development personnel primarily to develop our distributed systems product suite 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  bonuses  payroll taxes and benefits and certain non allocable administrative costs  including legal and accounting fees and bad debts 
general and administrative expenses were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively  representing  and of total revenue  respectively 
general and administrative expenses increased million or from fiscal to and remained essentially the same in fiscal and in fiscal  when compared to fiscal  the dollar increase is primarily due to increases in foreign currency exchange losses associated with a weaker us dollar  partially offset by the continuation of cost containment measures initially put in place in the third quarter of fiscal in fiscal  when compared to fiscal  the dollar amount was unchanged as general increases in infrastructure and insurance costs were offset by a decrease in foreign currency exchange losses 
we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollar terms as we expand our infrastructure and our operations in the future 
amortization of intangible assets  including goodwill in fiscal in connection with various prior acquisitions and most recently teamshare in june  the company has recorded million in intangible assets  off set by amortization totaling million as of january  of the total intangible assets  million  million and million was amortized in fiscal  and  respectively 
fiscal includes amortization of goodwill and identifiable assets with indefinite lives that beginning in fiscal is no longer being amortized under sfas in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangibles  which the company has adopted effective february  accordingly  with the commencement of fiscal  the company no longer amortizes goodwill but instead reviews goodwill for impairment annually 
excluding goodwill and other intangible assets that will no longer be amortized  we expect amortization expense for our intangible assets with finite lives to be approximately million  million  million and million in fiscal   and  respectively 
these intangible assets will be fully amortized by the end of fiscal see notes g  and of notes to consolidated financial statements of serena

interest income  interest expense and amortization of debt issuance costs interest income 
interest income was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively  representing decreases of million or in fiscal over and million or in fiscal over the dollar decrease in fiscal  when compared to fiscal  is generally due to reduced market interest rates  partially offset by increases in balances on interest bearing accounts  such as cash and cash equivalents  and both short and long term investments  resulting from the accumulation of earnings 
the dollar decrease in fiscal  when compared to fiscal  is generally due to reduced market interest rates and decreases in cash balances of million million due to the company s stock repurchase program implemented throughout fiscal and teamshare acquisition in june  respectively  all partially offset by increases in balances on interest bearing accounts  such as cash and cash equivalents  and both short and long term investments  resulting from the accumulation of earnings

income taxes income taxes 
income taxes were million  million and million in fiscal  and  representing effective income tax rates of  and  respectively 
the company s effective income tax rate has decreased annually 
the effective income tax rate decrease in fiscal  when compared to fiscal  is predominantly the result of decreases in non deductible charges and increased pre tax income growth  and to a lesser extent  increases in tax credits 
the effective income tax rate decrease in fiscal  when compared to fiscal  is in part due to research and experiment tax credits as a result of the teamshare acquisition in the second quarter of fiscal and changes in pre tax income projections 
serena s effective income tax rate has historically benefited from the united states research and experimentation tax credit and tax benefits generated from export sales made from the united states

in fiscal  the company s cash flows provided by operating activities exceeded net income principally due to the inclusion of non cash expenses in net income  cash collections in advance of revenue recognition for maintenance contracts  and decreases in both trade accounts receivable and net deferred tax assets  all partially offset by decreases in corporate taxes payable and accrued expenses 
in fiscal  the company s cash flows provided by operating activities exceed net income principally due to an increase in corporate taxes payable  the inclusion of non cash expenses in net income  and cash collections in advance of revenue recognition for maintenance contracts  all partially offset by increases in both accounts receivable and net deferred tax assets and a decrease in accrued expense

liabilities and leases 
at january   the company did not have any material commitments for capital expenditures and has no revolving credit agreement or other term loan agreements with any bank or other financial institution 
in december  the company issued million in subordinated convertible notes due december  the notes 
the notes bear interest at a rate of per annum and are payable semiannually on june and december of each year 
the notes are subordinated in right of payment to all of our future senior debt 
the notes are convertible into shares of the company s common stock prior to maturity at an initial

the company may redeem the notes  in whole or in part  under certain circumstances and at certain times 
accrued interest to the redemption date will be paid by the company in any such redemption 
upon conversion of of the notes  the company s common stock issued would be approximately million shares 
at january   the company had convertible subordinated notes outstanding totaling million

at january   the company had working capital of million and accounts receivable  net of allowances  of million 
total deferred revenue increased to million at january  from million at january  primarily as a result of increased billings of maintenance fees 
acquisitions 
the aggregate amount of cash paid relating to acquisitions during the fiscal year ended january  was approximately million 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item for a detailed discussion of completed acquisitions  which have affected our liquidity 
with respect to the company s offer to acquire merant plc  we have incurred and expect to incur in the future certain significant legal  accounting  advisor fees and other costs related to the offer 
such costs have been and will be incurred even if the company is unsuccessful in its offer to acquire merant plc 
in the event that the company is unsuccessful in its offer to acquire merant plc  for any reason  these charges would have a material adverse effect on our cash flow  earnings  operating results and financial condition 
off balance sheet arrangements 
as part of our ongoing business  we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  or spes  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as of january   we are not involved in any unconsolidated spe transactions 
we believe that current cash and short term investments  and cash flows from operations will satisfy our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months 
at some point in the future we may require additional funds for either operating or strategic purposes and may seek to raise the additional funds through public or private debt or equity financing 
if we ever need to seek additional financing  there is no assurance that this additional financing will be available  or if available  will be on reasonable terms and not dilutive to our stockholders

factors that may affect future results this report  including this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  contains forward looking statements under the private securities reform act of and other prospective information relating to future events 
these forward looking statements and other prospective information are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause results to differ materially from historical results or anticipated results  including but are not limited to  our ability to successfully integrate our recently announced offer for merant plc  our reliance on our mainframe products for revenue  the percentage of license revenue typically closed at the end of each quarter making estimation of operating results prior to the end of the quarter extremely uncertain  weak economic conditions worldwide which may continue to affect the overall demand for software and services  which has resulted in and could continue to result in decreased revenues or lower revenue growth rates  changes in revenue mix and seasonality  our ability to deliver our products on the distributed systems platform  dependence on revenues from our installed base  continued demand for additional mainframe mips capacity  expansion of our international organizations  our ability to manage our growth  and the following there are many factors  including some beyond our control  that may cause fluctuations in our quarterly operating results our quarterly operating results have varied greatly in the past and may vary greatly in the future depending upon a number of factors described below and elsewhere in this factors that may affect future results section of this report  including many that are beyond our control 
as a result  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful  and you should not rely on them as an indication of our future performance 
our software license revenue in any quarter depends on orders booked and shipped in the last month  weeks or days of that quarter 
at the end of each quarter  we typically have either minimal or no backlog of orders for the subsequent quarter 
if a large number of orders or several large orders do not occur or are deferred  our revenue in that quarter could be substantially reduced 
this would materially adversely affect our operating results and could impair our business in future periods 
because we do not know when  or if  our potential customers will place orders and finalize contracts  we cannot accurately predict our revenue and operating results for future quarters 
in addition  as a result of the economic slowdown worldwide  a number of customers have delayed discretionary spending for software and hardware  which has reduced our revenue 
additionally  sales cycles beginning in fiscal lengthened as customers delayed decisions to purchase our products and increase capacity on mainframe computers 
historically  a majority of our revenue has been attributable to the licenses of our mainframe software products 
changes in the mix of software products and services sold by us  including the mix between higher margin software products and lower margin maintenance and services  could materially affect our operating results for future quarters 
economic conditions worldwide could adversely affect our revenue growth and ability to forecast revenue the revenue growth and profitability of our business depends on the overall demand for application software and services 
because our sales are primarily to major corporate customers  our business also depends 
table of contents 
index to financial statements on general economic and business conditions 
the general weakening of the worldwide economy has caused the company to experience a decrease in revenues and revenue growth rates of its software licenses 
a softening of demand for computer software caused by a continued weakening of the economy  domestically or internationally  may result in a continued decrease in revenues and revenue growth rates 
our license revenues have fluctuated in recent years and we may not experience any license revenue growth in the future and our license revenues could in fact decline 
management personnel identify  track and forecast future revenues  backlog and trends in our business 
our sales personnel monitor the status of all proposals  such as the estimated date when a transaction will close and the potential dollar amount of such sale 
we aggregate these estimates periodically in order to generate a sales pipeline and then evaluate the pipeline at various times to look for trends in our business 
while this pipeline analysis provides visibility to our potential customers and the associated revenues for budgeting and planning purposes  these pipeline estimates may not consistently correlate to revenues in a particular quarter or ever 
a slowdown in the economy  domestically and internationally  has caused and may continue to cause customer purchasing decisions to be delayed  reduced in amount or cancelled  all of which have reduced and could continue to reduce the rate of conversion of the pipeline into contracts 
a variation in the pipeline or in the conversion of the pipeline into contracts could cause us to plan or budget improperly and thereby could adversely affect our business or results of operations 
in addition  primarily due to a substantial portion of our software licenses revenue contracts closing in the latter part of a quarter  management may not be able to adjust the company s cost structure in response to a variation in the conversion of the pipeline into contracts in a timely manner  and thereby adversely affect our business or results of operations 
if serena encounters difficulties integrating the business operations of serena and merant  it could adversely affect the business of the combined company we intend  to the extent possible  to integrate our operations with those of merant 
our goal in integrating these operations is to increase earnings and achieve cost savings by taking advantage of the significant anticipated synergies of consolidation and enhanced growth opportunities 
we anticipate incurring severance payments and other employee related costs  costs for lease terminations  meetings  trainings  rebranding  integration of information technology systems  and other costs in connection with the integration of serena and merant 
we cannot be sure that we will not encounter substantial difficulties integrating our operations with merant s operations  resulting in a delay or the failure to achieve the anticipated synergies and  therefore  the expected increases in earnings and cost savings 
the difficulties of combining the operations of the two companies include  among other things possible inconsistencies in standards  controls  procedures and policies  business cultures and compensation structures between serena and merant  coordinating and consolidating ongoing and future research and development efforts  consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructure  particularly in light of merant s complex corporate structure  integrating and managing the technologies and products of the two companies  including consolidating and integrating computer information systems  consolidating sales and marketing operations  retaining existing customers and attracting new customers  retaining strategic partners and attracting new strategic partners  retaining key employees  retaining and integrating distributors and key sales representatives  identifying and eliminating redundant and underperforming operations and assets  
table of contents 
index to financial statements using capital assets efficiently to develop the business of the combined company  minimizing the diversion of management s attention from ongoing business concerns  coordinating geographically separate organisations  possible tax costs or inefficiencies associated with integrating the operations of the combined company  possible modification of operating control standards in order to comply with the sarbanes oxley act of and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder  and retaining and attracting new employees to support existing and new products and new technology development 
for these reasons  we may fail to complete successfully the necessary integration of serena and merant  or to realise any of the anticipated benefits of the integration of the two companies 
actual cost savings and synergies may be lower than we currently expect and may take a longer time to achieve than we currently anticipate 
whether or not the offer is completed  the announcement of the offer may cause disruptions  including potential loss of customers  suppliers and other business partners  in the business of serena or merant  which could have material adverse effects on each company s or the combined company s business and operations whether or not the offer is completed  serena s and merant s customers  suppliers  distributors  licensors and other business partners  in response to the announcement of the offer  may adversely change or terminate their relationships with either company or the combined company  which could have a material adverse effect on the business of the company concerned 
certain of serena s or merant s current or potential customers may cancel or defer orders for each company s products 
in addition  customers of both companies may expect re negotiated pricing as a result of the offer or the announcement of the offer 
the announcement of the offer may also adversely affect the companies ability to attract new customers 
some of the contracts with suppliers  distributors  system integrators  customers  licensors  facility owners and other business partners require serena or merant to obtain consent from these other parties in connection with the offer 
if their consent cannot be obtained on favourable terms  the combined company may incur higher costs related to replacing suppliers  may suffer a loss of potential future revenue and may lose rights to facilities or intellectual property that are material to the business of the combined company 
charges to earnings resulting from the acquisition  including the application of the purchase method of accounting  and restructuring and integration costs may materially adversely affect the market value of serena shares following the acquisition in accordance with us gaap  the combined company will account for the acquisition using the purchase method of accounting 
the combined company will allocate the total estimated purchase price to merant s net tangible assets  amortisable intangible assets  and in process research and development based on their fair values as at the date of completion of the acquisition  and record the excess of the purchase price over those fair values as goodwill 
the combined company s financial results  including earnings per share  could be adversely affected by a number of financial adjustments required by us gaap including the following the portion of the existing deferred revenues on merant s balance sheet at the closing of the acquisition which represents maintenance revenue will be adjusted  based on estimated cost to deliver plus an appropriate gross margin  the portion of the estimated purchase price allocated to in process research and development will be expensed by the combined company in the quarter in which the acquisition is completed  
table of contents 
index to financial statements the combined company will incur additional amortization expense over the estimated useful lives of certain of the intangible assets acquired in connection with the acquisition during such estimated useful lives  and to the extent the value of goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite lives becomes impaired  the combined company may be required to incur material charges relating to the impairment of those assets 
we expect to incur costs associated with combining the operations of the two companies  including advisors fees and other costs related to the offer and the acquisition 
these costs may be substantial and may include those related to the severance and stock option acceleration provisions of merant s employee benefit plans  which could be triggered by the acquisition 
we also face potential costs related to employee redeployment or relocation  employee retention which could include salary increases  bonuses or option grants  reorganisation or closure of facilities  relocation and disposal of excess equipment  termination of contracts with third parties that provide redundant or conflicting services and other integration costs 
we have not yet determined the amount of these costs 
we expect to account for these costs as purchase related adjustments when the acquisition is completed  which will decrease our net income and impact cash balances for the periods in which those adjustments are made 
each of these charges would negatively impact earnings  which could have a material adverse effect on the price of serena shares 
the cash portion of the consideration to be paid in our offer to merant securityholders who accept the offer is based on a fixed amount of pounds sterling and  therefore  serena is subject to currency fluctuations through the payment date because serena will pay all holders of merant shares in pounds sterling  serena must buy pounds sterling with us dollars at the prevailing exchange rate on the payment date 
as a result  the actual amount of us dollars required to buy a sufficient amount of pounds sterling to pay the cash portion of the consideration to such holders will depend upon the exchange rate prevailing on the business day on which the funds are made available by serena to the uk receiving agent 
additionally  because the cash portion of the consideration payable in the offer is a fixed amount of pounds sterling  the actual amount of us dollars that serena will pay with respect to the cash portion of the consideration will depend upon the exchange rate prevailing on the business day on which the funds are made available by serena to the us depositary 
therefore  serena is subject to the risk of fluctuations in the dollar pound sterling exchange rate 
we have relied and expect to continue to rely on sales of our mainframe products for our revenue historically  the majority of our software license revenue has resulted from the sale of our mainframe products 
any factors adversely affecting the pricing of  demand for or market acceptance of our mainframe products  such as competition or technological change  could materially adversely affect our business and quarterly and annual operating results 
our mainframe products have been responsible for a significant portion of our revenue 
in each of the last three fiscal years ending january   and  sales of our mainframe products accounted for approximately  and of our total software licenses revenue  respectively 
we expect that these products will continue to account for a large portion of our software licenses revenue for the foreseeable future 
our future operating results depend on the continued market acceptance of our mainframe products  including future enhancements 
our future revenue is substantially dependent upon our installed customers renewing maintenance agreements for our products and licensing or upgrading additional serena ecm products  our future professional service and maintenance revenue is dependent on future sales of our software products we depend on our installed customer base for future revenues from maintenance renewal fees and licenses or upgrades of additional ecm products 
if our customers do not purchase additional products  upgrade existing 
table of contents 
index to financial statements products or cancel or fail to renew their maintenance agreements  this could materially adversely affect our business and future quarterly and annual operating results 
the terms of our standard license arrangements provide for a one time license fee and a prepayment of one year of software maintenance and support fees 
the maintenance agreements are renewable annually at the option of the customers and there are no minimum payment obligations or obligations to license additional software 
therefore  our current customers may not necessarily generate significant maintenance revenue in future periods 
in addition  our customers may not necessarily purchase additional products  upgrades or professional services 
our professional service revenue and maintenance revenue are also dependent upon the continued use of these services by our installed customer base 
any downturn in our software license revenue would have a negative impact on the growth of our professional service revenue and maintenance revenue in future quarters 
we expect that our operating expenses will increase in the future and these increased expenses may adversely affect our future operating results and financial condition although serena has been profitable in recent years  we may not remain profitable on a quarterly or annual basis in the future 
we anticipate that our expenses will increase in the foreseeable future as we increase our sales and marketing activities  including expanding our united states and international direct sales forces and extending our telesales efforts  develop our technology  including our distributed systems products  invest in penetrating the systems integrator and federal government marketplaces  include expenses associated with our teamshare acquisition  expand our distribution channels  and pursue strategic relationships and acquisitions 
with these additional expenses  in order to maintain our current levels of profitability  we will be required to increase our revenue correspondingly 
any failure to increase our revenue as we implement our product  service and distribution strategies would materially adversely affect our business  quarterly and annual operating results and financial condition 
our revenue has fluctuated in recent years and we may not experience any revenue growth in the future and our revenue could in fact decline 
our efforts to expand our software product suites  sales and marketing activities  direct and indirect distribution channels and professional service offerings and to pursue strategic relationships or acquisitions may not succeed or may prove more expensive than we currently anticipate 
as a result  we cannot predict our future operating results with any degree of certainty 
our business is dependent on the continued market for ibm and ibm compatible mainframes we are substantially dependent upon the continued use and acceptance of ibm and ibm compatible mainframes and the growth of this market 
if the role of the mainframe does not increase as we anticipate  or if it in any way decreases  this would materially adversely affect our business  future quarterly and annual operating results and financial condition 
additionally  if there is a wide acceptance of other platforms or if new platforms emerge that provide enhanced enterprise server capabilities  our business and future operating results may be materially adversely affected 
the majority of our software license revenue to date has been attributable to sales of our mainframe products 
we expect that  for the foreseeable future  the majority of our software license revenue will continue to come from sales of our mainframe products 
as a result  future sales of our existing products and associated maintenance revenue and professional service revenue will depend on continued use of mainframes 
our license revenues from products for distributed systems may fluctuate we introduced our changeman ds product in fiscal  our changeman alm and changeman ecp products in fiscal  our changeman wcm product in the first quarter of fiscal and our changeman

we are currently developing new products and enhancing our product suite to support additional distributed systems products 
if we do not successfully develop  market  sell and support our distributed systems products  this would materially adversely affect our business and our future quarterly and annual operating results 
historically  the majority of our products have been designed for the mainframe platform  and the majority of our software license revenue  maintenance revenue and professional services revenue to date have been attributable to licenses for these mainframe products 
we have limited experience developing  marketing  selling or supporting distributed systems products 
our sales and marketing organizations have historically focused exclusively on sales of our products for the mainframe and have limited experience marketing and selling distributed systems products 
additionally  we have limited experience in providing support services for distributed systems products 
many of our competitors have substantially greater experience providing distributed systems compatible software products than we do  and many also have significantly greater financial and organizational resources 
the license revenues from our ibm oem relationship may fluctuate in january  we entered into an oem agreement with ibm corporation ibm whereby ibm acquired the rights to resell our startool apm technology 
ibm provides serena a quarterly royalty report one month after each of ibm s calendar quarters detailing licenses and maintenance sold through to end users during the quarter 
while license revenues from our ibm oem relationship were of total license revenues in fiscal  they may fluctuate materially from quarter to quarter and could in fact decline 
we recognized our first revenue from this arrangement in the second quarter of fiscal because we have little or no visibility during the quarter on pipelines  sales forecasts  sales volumes or the amount of license revenue that will be reported  we cannot accurately predict the ibm revenue or our operating results for the quarter or any future quarter 
because the ibm oem license revenue may be significant to our total license revenue in any fiscal quarter  any decline in revenue could materially adversely affect our business and our future quarterly and annual operating results 
acquisitions may be difficult to integrate  disrupt our business  dilute stockholder value or divert the attention of our management in june  we acquired teamshare  inc  in march  we announced our offer for merant plc  and we may acquire or make investments in other companies and technologies 
in the event of any acquisitions or investments  we could issue stock that would dilute the ownership of our then existing stockholders  incur debt  assume liabilities  incur charges for the impairment of the value of investments or acquired assets  or incur amortization expense related to intangibles assets 
if we fail to achieve the financial and strategic benefits of past and future acquisitions or investments  our operating results will suffer 
acquisitions and investments involve numerous other risks  including difficulties integrating the acquired operations  technologies or products with ours  failure to achieve targeted synergies  unanticipated costs and liabilities  diversion of management s attention from our core business

any delays in our normally lengthy sales cycles could result in significant fluctuations in our quarterly operating results our sales cycle typically takes six to eighteen months to complete and varies from product to product 
any delay in the sales cycle of a large license or a number of smaller licenses could result in significant fluctuations in our quarterly operating results 
the length of the sales cycle may vary depending on a number of factors over which we may have little or no control  including the size and complexity of a potential transaction and the level of competition that we encounter in our selling activities 
beginning in fiscal  we have experienced an overall lengthening of sales cycles as customers delayed purchases or customers reduced budgets as a result of economic conditions 
additionally  the emerging market for ecm products and services contributes to the lengthy sales process in that during the sales cycle we often have to teach potential customers about the use and benefits of our products 
in certain circumstances  we license our software to customers on a trial basis to assist the customers in their evaluation of our products 
our sales cycle can be further extended for product sales made through third party distributors 
seasonal trends in sales of our software products may affect our quarterly operating results we have experienced and expect to continue to experience seasonality in sales of our software products 
these seasonal trends materially affect our quarter to quarter operating results 
revenue and operating results in our quarter ending january are typically higher relative to our other quarters  because many customers make purchase decisions based on their calendar year end budgeting requirements 
in addition  our january quarter tends to reflect the effect of the incentive compensation structure for our sales organization  which is based on satisfaction of fiscal year end quotas 
as a result  we have historically experienced a substantial decline in revenue in the first quarter of each fiscal year relative to the preceding quarter 
we expect our quarter ending october to reflect the effects of summer slowing of international business activity and spending activity generally associated with that time of year 
if the scm market does not evolve as we anticipate  our business will be adversely affected if we fail to properly assess and address the scm market or if our products and services fail to achieve market acceptance for any reason  our business and quarterly and annual operating results would be materially adversely affected 
the scm market is in an early stage of development 
it organizations have traditionally addressed scm needs internally and have only recently become aware of the benefits of third party scm solutions as their scm requirements have become more complex 
since the market for our products is still evolving  it is difficult to assess the competitive environment or the size of the market that may develop 
our future financial performance will depend in large part on the continued growth in the number of businesses adopting third party scm products and the expansion of their use on a company wide basis 
the scm market for third party products may grow more slowly than we anticipate 
in addition  technologies  customer requirements and industry standards may change rapidly 
if we cannot improve or augment our products as rapidly as existing technologies  customer requirements and industry standards evolve  our products or services could become obsolete 
the introduction of new or technologically superior products by competitors could also make our products less competitive or obsolete 
as a result of any of these factors  our position in existing markets or potential markets could be eroded 

table of contents 
index to financial statements we may experience delays in developing our products which could adversely affect our business if we are unable  for technological or other reasons  to develop and introduce new and improved products in a timely manner  this could materially adversely affect our business and future quarterly and annual operating results 
we have experienced product development delays in new version and update releases in the past and may experience similar or more significant product delays in the future 
to date  none of these delays has materially affected our business 
difficulties in product development could delay or prevent the successful introduction or marketing of new or improved products or the delivery of new versions of our products to our customers 
any delay in releasing our new distributed systems products  for whatever reason  would impair our revenue growth 
we intend to expand our international operations and may encounter a number of problems in doing so  there are also a number of factors associated with international operations that could adversely affect our business expansion of international operations 
we intend to expand the scope of our international operations  although more slowly than in prior years  and currently have sales subsidiaries in the united kingdom  germany  sweden  france and belgium 
if we are unable to expand our international operations successfully and in a timely manner  or if these operations experience declining revenue growth  this could materially adversely affect our business and quarterly and annual operating results 
we have only limited experience in marketing  selling and supporting our products internationally 
additionally  we do not have any experience in developing foreign language versions of our products 
such development may be more difficult or take longer than we anticipate 
we may not be able to successfully market  sell  deliver and support our products internationally 
risks of international operations 
international sales represented of our total revenue in the current fiscal year ended january   as compared to and in each of the fiscal years ended january  and  respectively 
our international revenue is attributable principally to our european operations 
our international operations are  and any expanded international operations will be  subject to a variety of risks associated with conducting business internationally that could materially adversely affect our business and future quarterly and annual operating results  including the following difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  problems in collecting accounts receivable  longer payment cycles  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  inability to control or predict the levels of revenue produced by our international distributors  seasonal reductions in business activity during the summer months in europe and certain other parts of the world  recessionary environments in foreign economies  or increases in tariffs  duties  price controls or other restrictions on foreign currencies or trade barriers imposed by foreign countries 
substantial leverage and debt service obligations may adversely affect our cash flow as a result of the sale of the convertible subordinated noted due  we incurred million of indebtedness 
there is a possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay the principal of  interest on and other amounts due in respect of our indebtedness when due 
we are not restricted under the indenture governing the notes from incurring additional debt in the future 
our substantial leverage could have significant negative consequences  including increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  limiting our ability to obtain additional financing  
table of contents 
index to financial statements requiring the dedication of a portion of our expected cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness  thereby reducing the amount of our expected cash flow available for other purposes  including capital expenditures  limiting our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we compete  and placing us at a possible competitive disadvantage relative to less leveraged competitors and competitors that have better access to capital resources 
fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies could result in currency transaction losses for serena a majority of our international business is conducted in foreign currencies  principally the british pound and euro 
fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar will continue to cause currency transaction gains and losses 
we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future quarterly and annual operating results 
we may experience currency losses in the future 
to date  we have not adopted a hedging program to protect serena from risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations 
serena is subject to intense competition in the scm industry and we expect to face increased competition in the future  including competition in the scm distributed systems market we may not be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors and such inability would materially adversely affect our business  quarterly and annual operating results and financial condition 
the market for our products is highly competitive and diverse 
moreover  the technology for scm products may change rapidly 
new products are frequently introduced  and existing products are continually enhanced 
competition may also result in changes in pricing policies by serena or our competitors  which could materially adversely affect our business and future quarterly and annual operating results 
competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the products and services that they offer 
many of our current and potential competitors have greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than we do 
as a result  they may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
they may also be able to devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products than we can 
mainframe competition 
we currently face competition from a number of sources  including customers internal it departments  providers of scm products that compete directly with changeman zmf and comparex such as computer associates  ibm and smaller private companies  and providers of application development programmer productivity and system management products such as compuware  ibm and smaller private companies 
competition in the distributed systems scm market 
we also face significant competition as we develop  market and sell our distributed systems products  including changeman ds and teamtrack 
if we are unable to successfully penetrate the distributed systems scm market  our business and future quarterly and annual operating results will be materially adversely affected 
penetrating the existing distributed systems scm market will be difficult 
competitors in the distributed systems market include ibm rational software  computer associates  merant  microsoft  telelogic and other smaller private companies 
future competition 
we may face competition in the future from established companies who have not previously entered the mainframe or distributed systems scm market  or from emerging software companies 
barriers to entry in the software market are relatively low 
increased competition may materially adversely affect our business and future quarterly and annual operating results due to price reductions  reduced gross margins and reduction in market share 
established companies may not only develop their own mainframe or distributed 
table of contents 
index to financial statements systems scm solutions  but they may also acquire or establish cooperative relationships with our current competitors  including cooperative relationships between large  established companies and smaller private companies 
because larger companies have significant financial and organizational resources available  they may be able to quickly penetrate the mainframe or distributed systems scm market through acquisitions or strategic relationships and may be able to leverage the technology and expertise of smaller companies and develop successful scm products for the mainframe 
we expect that the software industry  in general  and providers of scm solutions  in particular  will continue to consolidate 
it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 
bundling or compatibility risks 
our ability to sell our products also depends  in part  on the compatibility of our products with other third party products  particularly those provided by ibm 
developers of these third party products may change their products so that they will no longer be compatible with our products 
these third party developers may also decide to bundle their products with other scm products for promotional purposes 
if that were to happen  our business and future quarterly and annual operating results may be materially adversely affected as we may be priced out of the market or no longer be able to offer commercially viable products 
our executive officers and certain key personnel are critical to our business and such officers and key personnel may not remain with serena in the future our success will depend to a significant extent on the continued service of our senior executives and certain other key employees  including certain sales  consulting  technical and marketing personnel 
if we lost the services of one or more of our executives or key employees  including if one or more of our executives or key employees decided to join a competitor or otherwise compete directly or indirectly with serena  this could materially adversely affect our business 
in particular  we have historically relied on the experience and dedication of our product authors 
with the exception of douglas d 
troxel  serena s founder  chief technology officer and chairman of serena s board of directors  the employment of all of our senior and key employees  including key product authors  is at will 
mr 
troxel s employment is on a year to year basis 
in addition  we do not maintain key man life insurance on our employees and have no plans to do so 
our industry changes rapidly due to evolving technology standards and our future success will depend on our ability to continue to meet the sophisticated needs of our customers our future success will depend on our ability to address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers by supporting existing and emerging hardware  software  database and networking platforms particularly for our distributed systems products 
we will have to develop and introduce enhancements to our existing products and new products on a timely basis to keep pace with technological developments  evolving industry standards and changing customer requirements 
we expect that we will have to respond quickly to rapid technological change  changing customer needs  frequent new product introductions and evolving industry standards that may render existing products and services obsolete 
as a result  our position in existing markets or potential markets could be eroded rapidly by product advances 
the life cycles of our products are difficult to estimate 
our growth and future financial performance will depend in part upon our ability to enhance existing applications  develop and introduce new applications that keep pace with technological advances  meet changing customer requirements and respond to competitive products 
we expect that our product development efforts will continue to require substantial investments 
we may not have sufficient resources to make the necessary investments 
any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business  quarterly and annual operating results and financial condition 
our share price has been  and will likely continue to be  volatile the market price of our common shares has fluctuated significantly in recent months  and we expect that the market price of our common shares may fluctuate substantially as a result of variations in our quarterly operating results and market conditions 
these fluctuations may be exaggerated if the trading volume of our common 
table of contents 
index to financial statements shares is low 
in addition  the market price of our common shares may fluctuate dramatically in response to a variety of factors  including changes in estimates of our financial performance  shortfalls in revenues or net income expected by securities analysts  announcements of new products by the company or its competitors  quarterly fluctuations in the company s financial results or the results of other software companies  including those of direct competitors of the company  changes in analysts estimates of the company s financial performance  the financial performance of competitors  or the financial performance of software companies in general  general conditions in the software industry  changes in the amount the company receives in royalties from ibm  changes in the company s license revenue mix among the various platforms  changes in prices for the company s products or competitors products  changes in revenue growth rates for the company or its competitors  conditions in the financial markets  general market or economic conditions  the gain or loss of a significant customer or strategic relationship  changes in recommendations from securities analysts regarding our industry  our customers industries  or us announcements of technological or competitive developments  and acquisitions or entry into strategic alliances by our competitors or us 
because of this volatility  we may fail to meet the expectations of our stockholders or of securities analysts at some time in the future and the trading prices of our securities could decline as a result 
in addition  equity securities of many technology companies have recently experienced significant price and volume fluctuations 
these price and volume fluctuations are sometimes unrelated to the operating performance of the affected companies 
volatility in the market price of our common shares could result in securities class action litigation 
this type of litigation  regardless of the outcome  could result in substantial costs to us and a diversion of our management s attention and resources 
third parties in the future could assert that our products infringe their intellectual property rights  which could adversely affect our business third parties may claim that our current or future products infringe their proprietary rights 
any claims of this type could affect our relationships with existing customers and may prevent future customers from licensing our products 
because we are dependent upon a limited number of products  any such claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
royalty or license agreements may not be available on acceptable terms or at all 
we expect that software product developers will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in the software industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps 
as a result of these factors  infringement claims could materially adversely affect our business

index to financial statements errors in our products or the failure of our products to conform to specifications could result in our customers demanding refunds from us or asserting claims for damages against us because our software products are complex  they often contain errors or bugs that can be detected at any point in a product s life cycle 
while we continually test our products for errors and work with customers through our customer support services to identify and correct bugs in our software  we expect that errors in our products will continue to be found in the future 
although many of these errors may prove to be immaterial  certain of these errors could be significant 
detection of any significant errors may result in  among other things  loss of  or delay in  market acceptance and sales of our products  diversion of development resources  injury to our reputation  or increased service and warranty costs 
these problems could materially adversely affect our business and future quarterly and annual operating results 
in the past we have discovered errors in certain of our products and have experienced delays in the shipment of our products during the period required to correct these errors 
these delays have principally related to new version and product update releases 
to date none of these delays have materially affected our business 
however  product errors or delays in the future  including any product errors or delays associated with the introduction of our distributed systems products  could be material 
in addition  in certain cases we have warranted that our products will operate in accordance with specified customer requirements 
if our products fail to conform to such specifications  customers could demand a refund for the software license fee paid to us or assert claims for damages 
product liability claims asserted against us in the future could adversely affect our business we may be subject to claims for damages related to product errors in the future 
a material product liability claim could materially adversely affect our business 
our license agreements with our customers typically contain provisions designed to limit exposure to potential product liability claims 
serena s standard software licenses provide that if our products fail to perform  we will correct or replace such products 
if these corrective measures fail  we may be required to refund the license fee for such non performing product 
however  our standard license agreement limits our liability for non performing products to the amount of license fee paid  if the license has been in effect for less than one year  or to the amount of the licensee s current annual maintenance fee  if the license is more than one year old 
our standard license also provides that serena shall not be liable for indirect or consequential damages caused by the failure of our products 
such limitation of liability provisions may  however  not be effective under the laws of certain jurisdictions to the extent local laws treat certain warranty exclusions as unenforceable 
although we have not experienced any product liability claims to date  the sale and support of our products entail the risk of such claims 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company does not use derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio and has no foreign exchange contracts 
its financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents  short and long term investments  trade accounts receivable and accounts payable 
the company considers investments in highly liquid instruments purchased with a remaining maturity of days or less to be cash equivalents 
all of the company s cash equivalents and short and long term investments principally consist of commercial paper and debt securities  and are classified as available for sale as of january  the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to its short and long term investments and short term obligations  thus  a hypothetical fluctuation in interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair value of these securities 
sales to foreign countries accounted for approximately of the total sales for fiscal  as compared to and in fiscal and  respectively 
because the company invoices certain of its foreign sales in currencies other than the united states dollar  predominantly the british pound sterling and euro  and does not hedge these transactions  fluctuations in exchange rates could adversely affect the translated results of operations of the company s foreign subsidiaries 
therefore  foreign exchange fluctuations could create a risk of significant balance sheet gains or losses on the company s consolidated financial statements 
however  given the

index to financial statements company s foreign subsidiaries net book values as of january  and net cash flows for the most recent fiscal year then ended  the company does not believe that a hypothetical fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates would have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations
