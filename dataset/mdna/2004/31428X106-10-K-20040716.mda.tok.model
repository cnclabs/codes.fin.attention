item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition general the following management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition md a describes the principal factors affecting the results of operations  liquidity  capital resources and contractual cash obligations  as well as the critical accounting policies and estimates  of fedex corporation also referred to as fedex 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this annual report on form k annual report  including item business  item selected financial data  item financial statements and supplementary data  and item a controls and procedures  which include additional information about our significant accounting policies  practices and the transactions that underlie our financial results 
our md a is comprised of three major sections results of operations  financial condition and critical accounting policies and estimates 
results of operations begins with an overview of consolidated results compared to  and of results compared to this section includes a discussion of key actions  such as our business realignment initiatives and the acquisition of fedex kinko s  as well as a discussion of our outlook for the overview is followed by a financial summary and narrative including a discussion of both historical operating results and our outlook for for each of our four reportable operating segments 
we then provide an analysis of changes in our balance sheet and cash flows and discuss our financial commitments in the financial condition section 
we conclude with a discussion of the critical accounting policies and estimates that we believe are important to understanding the judgments and assumptions incorporated in our reported financial results 
fedex provides a broad portfolio of transportation  e commerce and business services with companies that operate independently and compete collectively under the respected fedex brand 
these operating companies are primarily represented by fedex express  the world s largest express transportation company  fedex ground  north america s second largest provider of small package ground delivery service  fedex freight  a leading us provider of regional ltl freight services  and fedex kinko s  a leading provider of document solutions and business services 
these companies form the core of our reportable segments 
in  we changed the reporting and responsibility relationships of our smaller business units so that they now report directly to a core segment 
see reportable segments for further discussion and refer to item business for a more detailed description of each of our operating companies 
the key factors that affect our operating results are as follows the overall customer demand for our various services  the volumes of transportation and business services provided through our networks  primarily measured by our average daily volume and shipment weight  the mix of services purchased by our customers  the prices we obtain for our services  primarily measured by average price per shipment yield  our ability to manage our cost structure for capital expenditures and operating expenses such as salaries and benefits  fuel and maintenance  and our ability to match operating costs to shifting volume levels 
except as otherwise specified  references to years indicate our fiscal year ended may  or ended may of the year referenced and comparisons are to the prior year

results for reflect our adoption of sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
we recognized an adjustment of million million  net of tax  or per diluted share to reduce the carrying value of certain goodwill to its implied fair value

the following table shows changes in revenues and operating income by reportable segment for compared to  and compared to in millions change revenues percent change revenues change operating income percent change operating income fedex express segment   fedex ground segment fedex freight segment fedex kinko s segment n a n a n a n a n a n a other and eliminations n a n a n a n a includes million of business realignment costs described below 
includes the results of operations of fedex kinko s from february  date of acquisition through february  approximately million of revenue and million of operating income 
revenue growth during was attributable to increased volumes of fedex express international priority ip  fedex ground and fedex freight shipments  as well as strong growth of ip yields at fedex express 
yield improvements at fedex ground and fedex freight also contributed to revenue growth 
in addition  fedex kinko s acquired on february  added million of revenue during during  revenue growth was due to the substantial growth of our fedex ground business  increased international volumes at fedex express and higher revenues at fedex freight 
increased us freight volumes at fedex express also contributed to consolidated revenue growth in  as we benefited from a full twelve months of revenue under the transportation agreement with the us postal service usps  which commenced in late august operating income decreased in as costs related to our business realignment initiatives totaled million partially offset by approximately million of savings 
see business realignment costs for a discussion of these costs and related savings 
in total  operating expenses  other than business realignment costs  increased less than the increase in revenue during  despite significant increases in incentive compensation  pension and maintenance costs 
during  operating income increased as fedex ground significantly improved its operating margin  which more than offset a decline in the operating margin at fedex express 
the sluggish economy  combined with significant increases in pension and healthcare costs and higher maintenance expenses  reduced profitability at fedex express in despite continued cost control efforts 
salaries and benefits expense increased during due to higher incentive compensation and pension costs  wage rate increases and the acquisition of fedex kinko s 
incentive compensation increased approximately million during due to above plan operating income  primarily at fedex express and fedex freight 
incentive compensation declined in based on below plan performance at fedex express 
pension costs were approximately million higher in on top of an million increase in  due principally to lower discount rates and decreased returns on pension plan assets 
although not legally required  we made million in contributions to our qualified us pension plans in compared to total contributions exceeding billion in our contributions were made to ensure our qualified us pension plan assets exceeded the related accumulated benefit obligations at our february  plan measurement date 
other income and expense and income taxes net interest expense decreased slightly in as the effects of the tax case described below offset increases to interest expense 
these increases were due to the amendment of aircraft operating leases and the adoption of financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
 which together resulted in eight md aircraft being recorded as fixed assets and the related obligations being recorded as long term debt 
interest expense also increased due to additional borrowings related to the fedex kinko s acquisition 
net interest expense was lower in due to reduced borrowings 
in august  we received a favorable ruling from the us district court in memphis over the tax treatment of jet engine maintenance costs 
the court held that these costs were ordinary and necessary business expenses and properly deductible 
as a result of this decision  we recognized a one time benefit in of million  net of tax  or per diluted share  primarily related to the reduction of accruals related to this matter and the recognition of interest earned on amounts previously paid to the irs 
future periods are not expected to be materially affected by the resolution of this matter 
although the irs has appealed this ruling  we believe the district court s ruling will be upheld also  see note to the accompanying audited financial statements 
our effective tax rate was in  in and in the lower effective rate in was primarily attributable to the favorable decision in the tax case discussed above  stronger than anticipated international results and the results of tax audits during our stronger than anticipated international results  along with other factors  increased our ability to credit income taxes paid to foreign governments on foreign income against us income taxes paid on the same income  thereby mitigating our exposure to double taxation 
the effective tax rate in was higher than the rate primarily due to lower state taxes in the effective tax rate exceeds the statutory us federal tax rate primarily because of state income taxes 
for  we expect the effective tax rate to be approximately 
the actual rate  however  will depend on a number of factors  including the amount and source of operating income 
business realignment costs during  voluntary early retirement incentives with enhanced pension and postretirement healthcare benefits were offered to certain groups of employees at fedex express who were age or older 
voluntary cash severance incentives were also offered to eligible employees at fedex express 
these programs  which commenced august  and expired during the second quarter  were limited to eligible us salaried staff employees and managers 
approximately  employees accepted offers under these programs 
the response to these voluntary programs substantially exceeded our expectations 
consequently  replacement management and staff were required and some employee departure dates were deferred up to may  
costs were also incurred in for the elimination of certain management positions at fedex express and other business units based on the staff reductions from the voluntary programs and other cost reduction initiatives 
costs for the benefits provided under the voluntary programs were recognized in the period that eligible employees accepted the offer 
other costs associated with business realignment activities were recognized in the period incurred 
we recognized million of business realignment costs during savings of approximately million were realized  reflected primarily in lower salaries and benefits costs 
the components of our business realignment costs and changes in the related accruals were as follows for the year ended may  in millions voluntary retirement voluntary severance other total beginning accrual balances charged to expense cash paid amounts charged to other assets liabilities ending accrual balances other includes costs for management severance agreements  which are payable over future periods  including compensation related to the modification of previously granted stock options and incremental pension and healthcare benefits 
other also includes professional fees directly associated with the business realignment initiatives and relocation costs 
total cash payments under these programs are expected to be approximately million 
amounts charged to other assets liabilities relate primarily to incremental pension and healthcare benefits 
over the past few years  we have taken many steps toward bringing our expense growth in line with revenue growth  particularly at fedex express  while maintaining our industry leading service levels 
we have significantly decreased capital expenditures by reducing aircraft orders  consolidating facilities and discontinuing low value programs 
these business realignment initiatives are another step in this ongoing process of reducing our cost structure in order to increase our competitiveness  meet the future needs of our employees and provide the expected financial returns for our shareholders 
fedex kinko s acquisition on february   we acquired fedex kinko s for approximately billion in cash 
we also assumed million of capital lease obligations 
fedex kinko s is a leading provider of document solutions and business services 
its network of worldwide locations offers access to color printing  finishing and presentation services  internet access  videoconferencing  outsourcing  managed services  web based printing and document management solutions 
the transaction was accounted for as a purchase 
accordingly  the assets and liabilities of fedex kinko s were recorded at their fair values and the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired was recorded as goodwill 
a significant amount of the purchase price was recorded as goodwill  as the acquisition of fedex kinko s expands our portfolio of business services  while providing a substantially enhanced capability to provide package shipping services to small and medium sized business customers through fedex kinko s array of retail store locations 
the assets and liabilities related to fedex kinko s have been included in the accompanying audited balance sheet based on a purchase price allocation 
the allocation of the purchase price to the fair value of the assets acquired  liabilities assumed and goodwill  as well as the assignment of goodwill to our reportable segments  was based primarily on internal estimates of cash flows and independent appraisals 
we used an independent appraisal firm to determine the fair value of certain assets and liabilities  primarily property and equipment and acquired intangible assets  including the kinko s trade name  customer related intangibles  technology assets and contract based intangibles 
while the purchase price allocation is substantially complete and we do not expect any material adjustments  we may make adjustments to the purchase price allocation if new data becomes available 
see notes and to the accompanying audited financial statements for further discussion of the purchase price allocation and goodwill and intangible assets 
the results of operations of fedex kinko s have been included in our consolidated financial statements from february  during  fedex kinko s contributed million of revenue and per diluted share of earnings  which includes approximately million of interest and financing costs and million of rebranding costs 
note to the accompanying audited financial statements includes the unaudited pro forma results of operations of fedex as if the acquisition had occurred as of the beginning of the accounting literature establishes firm guidelines around how this pro forma information is presented  which precludes the assumption of business synergies 
therefore  this unaudited pro forma information is not intended to represent  nor do we believe it is indicative of the consolidated results of operations of fedex that would have been reported had the acquisition been completed as of the beginning of furthermore  this pro forma information is not representative of the future consolidated results of operations of fedex 
we paid a portion of the purchase price from available cash balances 
to finance the remainder of the purchase price  we entered into a six month credit facility for billion 
during february  we issued commercial paper backed by unused commitments under this facility 
in march  we replaced the commercial paper with the issuance of billion of senior unsecured notes in three maturity tranches one  three and five years at million  million and million  respectively 
we canceled the six month credit facility in march see notes and of the accompanying audited financial statements for further discussion 
airline stabilization compensation operations in were significantly affected by the terrorist attacks on september  during  we recognized a total of million of compensation under the air transportation safety and system stabilization act the act  of which million had been received as of may  the amounts recognized were for our estimate of losses we incurred as a result of the mandatory grounding of our aircraft and for incremental losses incurred through december  all amounts recognized were reflected as reduction of operating expense under the caption airline stabilization compensation 
in the fourth quarter of  the department of transportation dot asserted that we were overpaid by million and has demanded repayment 
we have filed requests for administrative and judicial review 
we received an opinion from the district of columbia us court of appeals stating that most of the determinations that we requested were not yet ripe for decision and the court will not rule prior to final determination by the dot and exhaustion of administrative remedies 
pursuant to the federal aviation administration reauthorization enacted during the third quarter of  the general accounting office submitted a report to congress on june   on the criteria and procedures used by the secretary of transportation under the act 
issuance of the report frees the dot to make a final determination on our claim and also reinforces the congressional directive to the dot to refer any remaining disputed claims to an administrative law judge upon an affected claimant s request 
we agreed to mediation with the dot  but it did not result in a resolution of the dispute 
we will continue to pursue our claim for compensation under the act 
we believe that we have complied with all aspects of the act  that it is probable we will ultimately collect the remaining million receivable and that we will not be required to pay any portion of the dot s million demand 
we cannot be assured of the ultimate outcome  however  it is reasonably possible that a material reduction to the million of compensation we have previously recognized under the act could occur 
based on the dot s assertion  the range for potential loss on this matter is zero to million 
outlook during particularly during the first half  we expect the us economy to sustain the growth evident in the second half of this growth is supported by strong corporate earnings  higher consumer confidence led by both increasing income and an improving job market and public sector improvement 
the macro economic environment during was particularly challenging for our business  as the manufacturing and wholesale sectors of the economy lagged behind gross domestic product  and year over year performance in the economy lagged sequential quarter to quarter growth 
we expect the current economic expansion to broaden into the manufacturing and wholesale sectors during as supported by the recent strengthening of durable goods sales  indicating the inventory restocking cycle has started 
this is further supported by the positive year over year volume trends across all our transportation companies in the fourth quarter of we also expect a strong global economy in  evidenced by recent broad based growth across multiple sectors and regions  particularly in asia 
our outlook anticipates revenue and earnings growth in all our reportable segments for  as we continue to leverage our compete collectively philosophy 
our optimism stems from increasing customer demand for services across our operating companies  a lower cost structure at fedex express  as well as improving worldwide economic conditions 
during  we expect continued strong growth of international volumes and yields at fedex express 
we expect only slight us domestic volume growth at fedex express  with higher us domestic yields to account for a large portion of revenue growth at fedex express 
we anticipate improved volumes and yields at fedex ground and fedex freight  as fedex ground continues its multi year capacity expansion plan and fedex freight continues to grow its regional and interregional business and enhance its portfolio of services 
fedex kinko s revenue is projected to be approximately billion  which is significantly higher than the partial year revenue included in our results 
fedex kinko s will focus on continuing to generate revenue growth by aggressively growing current lines of business and by leveraging its new relationship with fedex 
we anticipate significant year over year growth of both operating income and margins 
these measures will be positively impacted by revenue growth and the full year savings from our business realignment initiatives which are expected to be approximately million to million higher than savings discussed above 
over the past several years we have experienced significant year over year increases in pension cost 
for  we expect a modest million increase in pension cost  as actual asset returns have substantially improved the funded status of our pension plans in spite of a continued decline in the discount rate 
also  incentive compensation programs were reinstated to more normalized levels in  after several years of declines 
our management teams continue to examine additional cost reduction and operational productivity opportunities as we focus on optimizing our networks  improving our service offerings  enhancing the customer experience and positioning fedex to increase cash flow and financial returns by improving our operating margin 
during  we expect to incur approximately million of expenses related to the fedex kinko s rebranding 
in addition  we plan to open approximately new fedex kinko s locations  including many internationally 
despite these costs  we expect fedex kinko s to contribute to earnings growth in as we move quickly to expand our service offerings at its us locations 
see fedex kinko s acquisition and reportable segments for additional discussion 
the pilots of fedex express  which represent a small number of fedex express total employees  are employed under a collective bargaining agreement 
negotiations with the pilots union began in march  as the current agreement became amendable on may  we will continue to operate under our current agreement while we negotiate with our pilots 
our financial results for may be affected by the results of these negotiations 
however  we cannot estimate the financial impact  if any  the results of these negotiations may have on our results of operations 
increased security requirements for air cargo carriers have been put in place and have not had a material impact on our operating results for the periods presented 
although no specific proposals have been issued  further measures may be forthcoming 
the impact on our results of operations of any such additional measures is unknown 
future results will depend upon a number of factors  including us and international economic conditions  the impact from any terrorist activities or international conflicts  our ability to match our cost structure and capacity with shifting volume levels  our ability to effectively leverage our new service and growth initiatives and our ability to effectively operate  integrate and leverage the fedex kinko s business 
in addition  adjustments to our fuel surcharges at fedex express lag changes in actual jet fuel prices paid 
therefore  our operating income could be materially affected should the spot price of jet fuel suddenly change by a significant amount or should we be unable to further increase our fuel surcharges in response to rising fuel prices due to competitive pressures 
see forward looking statements for a more complete discussion of potential risks and uncertainties that could materially affect our future performance 
seasonality of business our express package and freight businesses are seasonal in nature 
historically  the us express package business experiences an increase in volumes in late november and december 
international business  particularly in the asia to us market  peaks in october and november due to us holiday sales 
our first and third fiscal quarters  because they are summer vacation and post winter holiday seasons  have historically exhibited lower volumes relative to other periods 
the transportation and business services industries are affected directly by the state of the overall domestic and international economies 
seasonal fluctuations affect volumes  revenues and earnings 
normally  the fall of each year is the busiest shipping period for fedex ground  while late december  january  june and july of each year are the slowest periods 
for fedex freight  the spring and fall of each year are the busiest periods and the latter part of december  january and february of each year are the slowest periods 
shipment levels  operating costs and earnings for each of our transportation companies can also be adversely affected by inclement weather 
new accounting pronouncements no new accounting pronouncements had a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows during reportable segments fedex express  fedex ground  fedex freight and fedex kinko s form the core of our reportable segments 
in  we changed the reporting and responsibility relationships of our smaller business units so they now report directly to a core segment 
prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the new segment presentation 
for further discussion of our operating companies  refer to item business 
our reportable segments include the following businesses fedex express segment fedex express express transportation fedex trade networks global trade services fedex ground segment fedex ground small package ground delivery fedex supply chain services contract logistics fedex freight segment fedex freight regional ltl freight fedex custom critical surface expedited transportation caribbean transportation services airfreight forwarding fedex kinko s segment fedex kinko s document solutions and business services fedex services provides customer facing sales  marketing and information technology support  primarily for fedex express and fedex ground 
the costs for these activities are allocated based on metrics such as relative revenues and estimated services provided 
these allocations materially approximate the cost of providing these functions 
the line item intercompany charges on the accompanying financial summaries of our reportable segments includes the allocations from fedex services to fedex express  fedex ground and fedex freight  allocations for services provided between operating companies  and certain other costs such as corporate management fees related to services received for general corporate oversight  including executive officers and certain legal and finance functions 
management evaluates segment financial performance based on operating income

package and freight statistics include only the operations of fedex express 
fedex express segment revenues fedex express segment total revenues increased in  principally due to higher ip revenues in asia  europe and us outbound 
ip revenues increased significantly on volume growth and higher yield 
asia experienced strong average daily volume growth led by china with volume growth of over  while outbound shipments from europe  the united states and latin america continued to improve 
the increase in ip yield was largely attributable to europe 
the yield increase was primarily due to higher average weight per package  favorable exchange rate differences and higher fuel surcharge revenue 
us domestic package revenue increased in as both volumes and yields grew slightly 
for us domestic composite yield  a small decline in average rate per pound was offset by increases in average weight per package and fuel surcharge revenue 
for us domestic shipments and us outbound international shipments  an average list price increase of  along with certain surcharge increases  became effective january  freight revenue increased in due to increased yields related to service mix  despite lower volumes 
fedex express segment total revenues increased in  largely due to increased ip and us freight revenues 
year over year revenue comparisons reflect the impact in of the terrorist attacks on september   which adversely affected both us outbound international shipments and us domestic shipments  and the economic decline that began in calendar ip volume growth occurred predominantly in asia and europe  which experienced average daily volume growth rates of and  respectively  during ip yield improvements during were due to favorable exchange rate differences  increased fuel surcharge revenue and growth in higher yielding lanes 
us domestic package revenue increased in due to higher yield and volumes in the us deferred and overnight box categories 
the increase in us domestic package yield during was due to higher fuel surcharge revenue and average list price increases 
higher us freight revenues from increased average daily pounds during also affected year over year revenue comparisons  as we benefited from a full twelve months of operations and higher shipping levels under our transportation contract with the usps  which began in august fuel surcharge revenue was higher in and primarily due to higher jet fuel prices and the introduction of certain international dynamic fuel surcharges in september our dynamic fuel surcharges are based on the spot price for jet fuel 
during  fuel surcharge revenue was also higher because our dynamic index for determining our us domestic fuel surcharge was not implemented until the second quarter of using this index  the us domestic fuel surcharge ranged between and during  and during and between and from november through may international fuel surcharges ranged between and during and were as high as during fedex express segment operating income during  operating income decreased due to business realignment costs totaling million partially offset by approximately million of savings 
higher incentive compensation and pension costs and base salary increases  as well as higher maintenance expenses  were offset by revenue growth and ongoing cost control efforts 
in addition  benefited from one additional operating day 
during  the decrease in operating income and the decline in operating margin at fedex express were attributable to increased employee benefits costs  higher maintenance expenses and  to a lesser extent  the net impact of higher fuel costs in an economic environment of sluggish us domestic average daily package volumes 
contributing to the decrease in operating income was one fewer operating day 
operating results during were also impacted by unusually inclement weather during the winter and spring  which decreased business shipping  reduced operational efficiency and increased certain operating costs  such as for snow removal and de icing 
salaries and benefits were higher during due to higher incentive compensation and pension costs and wage rate increases 
this increase was partially offset by savings from the business realignment initiatives 
the increase was due to wage rate increases and higher pension and healthcare costs 
in addition  higher salaries and benefits were partially the result of cost increases related to the usps contract 
incentive compensation provisions declined in based on below plan performance 
purchased transportation costs increased in and as ip volume growth led to an increase in contract pick up and delivery services 
higher maintenance costs in both and were primarily due to the timing of scheduled aircraft maintenance events  higher utilization of aircraft related to usps volumes and a higher average age of certain types of our aircraft 
intercompany charges increased during due to higher incentive compensation  healthcare and pension costs and base salary increases at fedex services 
fuel costs were higher in due to a increase in the average price per gallon of aircraft fuel  as fuel consumption was flat 
however  fuel surcharge revenue more than offset higher jet fuel prices primarily due to the introduction of certain international dynamic fuel surcharges in september fuel consumption was higher in  primarily due to an increase in aircraft usage as a result of incremental us freight pounds transported under the usps agreement and ip volume growth 
fuel costs were also higher in due to a increase in the average price per gallon of aircraft fuel 
higher net fuel costs at fedex express negatively affected operating income during  as fuel surcharge revenue increases were not sufficient to offset higher jet fuel prices 
rentals and landing fees decreased in due to the amendment of operating leases for six md aircraft that resulted in these aircraft being recorded as fixed assets under capital lease 
in addition  as discussed in note to the accompanying audited financial statements  two additional mds were recorded as fixed assets at september  as a result of the adoption of fin depreciation and amortization expense declined slightly due to decreases in capital spending  despite the additional depreciation from the eight md aircraft added to fixed assets 
during  other operating expenses increased at fedex express as reimbursements in from the usps for network expansion costs were reflected as credits in other operating expenses 
these reimbursements  however  had no effect on operating income  as they represented the recovery of incremental costs incurred 
partially offsetting operating costs during was a gain from the insurance settlement on an aircraft destroyed in an accident in july that resulted in a net million favorable impact on operating income 
during  other operating expenses included million from the favorable resolution of certain state tax matters 
fedex express segment outlook we anticipate revenue growth at fedex express during  in both the domestic and international markets 
revenue increases will be led by ip  where we expect volume and yield growth  particularly in asia  us outbound and europe 
we expect only slight us domestic volume growth at fedex express  with higher us domestic yields to account for a large portion of revenue growth at fedex express 
we expect significant operating margin improvement at fedex express during  led by the full year salaries and benefits savings of our business realignment initiatives 
these cost management actions and improved volumes  along with a sharp focus on productivity  are expected to produce improved operational efficiency 
in addition  we expect additional improvement due to ip volume growth with solid incremental margins  increased us domestic yields and volumes aided by the fedex kinko s retail presence and the impact of reduced capital spending in prior years 
while capital expenditures at fedex express are expected to be higher than due to planned aircraft purchases to support ip volume growth  they are expected to remain below historical levels

fedex ground segment revenues revenues increased during due to higher volumes and yield improvement  led by increased usage of our home delivery service 
average daily volume continued its sequential growth in the fourth quarter  with a increase over the fourth quarter of  up from  and growth in the first  second and third quarters  respectively 
the lower average daily volume increase for was due to a difficult year over year comparison  as first quarter volume included an estimated  to  daily packages as a result of the threat of a ups work stoppage 
in addition  benefited from two additional operating days 
the fedex ground segment realized revenue growth in  despite one less operating day  due to increased volumes in our business to business shipments and continued growth of our home delivery service 
during  our home delivery service added facilities to reach nearly coverage of the us population 
yield at fedex ground increased in primarily due to general rate increases and an increase in extra services revenue  partially offset by higher customer discounts and the elimination of the fuel surcharge in january 
an average list price increase of on fedex ground services became effective january  on that date  the fuel surcharge for all fedex ground shipments was discontinued 
in  year over year yield increases were due to an average list price increase of  which became effective january  partially offsetting the effect of the price increase were higher levels of discounts and lower average weight per package 
in the third quarter of  fedex ground implemented a dynamic fuel surcharge  based on the spot price for on highway diesel fuel 
before its elimination in january  this surcharge ranged between and during  between and during and between and from february through may fedex ground segment operating income operating income increased in due to volume growth  yield improvements and increased productivity 
these gains were partially offset by higher intercompany charges  increased healthcare and pension costs and expenses related to terminal expansions and relocations 
fedex ground utilized a larger portion of allocated sales  marketing  information technology and customer support resources 
the cost of providing these services increased due to higher incentive compensation  healthcare and pension costs and base salary increases at fedex services 
operating margin for the segment was also negatively affected by operating losses at fedex supply chain services 
operating margins improved in as fedex ground realized substantial improvements in pick up and delivery and linehaul productivity 
similar to  intercompany charges increased due to the utilization of a larger portion of allocated resources from fedex services 
salaries and employee benefits increased in due to higher pension costs and increases in staffing to support volume growth 
operating results during were also impacted by inclement weather during the winter and spring  which was more severe than in previous years 
the increase in operating income in both and was also attributable to improved home delivery service results 
in september  fedex ground completed the build out of its national home delivery network  enabling it to reach nearly of us residences  with evening  weekend and day and time specific delivery options  all backed by a money back guarantee 
our home delivery service became profitable during this service had an operating loss of million during fedex ground segment outlook we expect fedex ground to return to double digit revenue growth in  led by increased home delivery and next business day package volume and modest yield improvement 
average daily volume is expected to improve on its growth of 
anticipated yield improvements from the average list price increase and extra services revenue will be partially offset by the impact from the elimination of fedex ground s fuel surcharge in january fedex ground will also continue to place emphasis on improving on time delivery  productivity and safety 
during  we expect continued growth in capital spending at fedex ground as we continue to focus on network capacity expansion 
as a result of losses at fedex supply chain services  higher facility expenses due to expansion and slower yield growth primarily due to the elimination of fedex ground s fuel surcharge  we expect the operating margin will be comparable to fedex freight segment the following table shows revenues  operating expenses and operating income and margin dollars in millions and selected statistics for the years ended may percent change revenues    operating expenses salaries and employee benefits    purchased transportation rentals and landing fees depreciation and amortization fuel maintenance and repairs intercompany charges other total operating expenses    operating income operating margin average daily ltl shipments in thousands weight per ltl shipment lbs    ltl yield revenue per hundredweight fedex freight segment revenues the double digit increase in fedex freight segment revenues during was primarily due to increases in ltl yield and ltl average daily shipments 
year over year growth in ltl average daily shipments accelerated to in the fourth quarter of  reflecting a strengthening economy and market share gains 
ltl yield grew during the year  reflecting incremental fuel surcharges due to higher fuel prices  growth in our interregional freight service  a general rate increase in june and favorable contract renewals 
in addition  had one additional operating day 
revenues increased during due to improved ltl yield  despite the continued impact of a slow economy  severe winter weather and one fewer operating day during the year 
fedex freight segment operating income the increase in operating income at the fedex freight segment during was primarily attributable to ltl revenue growth and cost management 
operating margins improved as yield management and operational productivity gains outpaced increased incentive compensation  fuel  insurance and claims  pension and healthcare costs 
purchased transportation increased primarily due to the growth of our interregional freight service 
during  operating income also increased due to ltl revenue growth and cost management 
lower depreciation and amortization during reflects increased gains from the sale of operating assets in the ordinary course of business 
operating margin improved more than basis points in on strong revenue growth 
lower operating margins in reflect higher maintenance and repairs expenses  which include million of incremental expenses associated with rebranding our two regional ltl carriers under the common name fedex freight 
the rebranding project began in the fourth quarter of and is expected to be complete in through the end of  rebranding expenses totaled million of the anticipated total project cost of million 
these costs  which are being expensed as incurred  consist primarily of incremental external costs for rebranding tractors and trailers 
fedex freight segment outlook we expect revenue to continue to grow in  due to both ltl yield improvement and ltl daily shipment growth 
continued market share growth  a general rate increase and a relatively stable industry pricing environment are expected to contribute to ltl yield improvement 
we implemented a general rate increase of  effective june  our no fee money back guarantee  implemented in september  continues to be a differentiator in the market  generating additional business with new and existing customers 
continued consolidation among carriers and an improving economy are providing many opportunities for fedex freight to promote its profitable interregional service 
in addition  through collaboration with other fedex operating companies  fedex freight is increasing business levels with its major customers 
contributing to the positive outlook for is fedex freight s disciplined approach to yield management  coupled with strategic investments in capacity 
fedex kinko s segment the following table shows revenues  operating expenses and operating income and margin dollars in millions for the fourth quarter ended may  revenues operating expenses salaries and employee benefits rentals depreciation and amortization maintenance and repairs other total operating expenses operating income operating margin fedex kinko s segment operating results the results of operations of fedex kinko s are included in our consolidated results from the date of acquisition february  
the fedex kinko s segment was formed in the fourth quarter of the results of operations from february  the date of acquisition through february  were included in other and eliminations approximately million of revenue and million of operating income 
fedex kinko s has focused on strengthening its current lines of business  which include black and white  color and custom printing  copying and binding services  facilities management and outsourcing  high speed internet access and computer usage  signs and graphics  sale of retail products and others 
fourth quarter revenue was primarily driven by strong performance in signs and graphics  finishing services and retail products 
as in home technological advances have impacted the traditional retail walk up business  fedex kinko s has expanded its efforts to attract a larger share of the commercial document solutions and business service market 
fedex kinko s operating margin benefited from strong revenue performance during the fourth quarter 
additionally  our efforts to optimize production machines within each store location resulted in reduced lease and maintenance costs 
negatively impacting operating margin was approximately million of rebranding costs 
the caption other in the financial summary above includes supplies and other direct costs  such as paper and toner 
fedex kinko s segment outlook in  fedex kinko s will focus on continuing to generate revenue growth by leveraging its new relationship with fedex 
fedex kinko s plans to open approximately new locations in  including many internationally 
in addition  there are significant opportunities for growth in full service color copies  finishing services and signs and graphics product offerings 
we expect operating margins to decrease in  as fedex kinko s will absorb a portion of the fedex corporation headquarters fees commencing in and approximately million in rebranding costs 
on april   we announced the new brand identity for fedex kinko s retail locations fedex kinko s office and print centers 
following this announcement  we began accepting packages to be shipped from our us locations 
this capability will also allow fedex kinko s to launch pack and ship services in management is also focusing on cost reduction and control  with continued focus on machine optimization  increased opportunities for strategic sourcing of operating expenses such as supplies and machines and implementing best practices across the fedex kinko s network 
capital expenditures are expected to be approximately million  primarily for technology and equipment related projects  real estate and rebranding

see capital resources for further discussion 
debt financing activities 
our commercial paper program is backed by unused commitments under two credit agreements  totaling billion  and reduces the amount available under these agreements 
commercial paper borrowings of billion were necessary to finance part of our billion acquisition of fedex kinko s 
these borrowings were backed by a new six month billion credit agreement 
during february  we issued commercial paper backed by unused commitments under this facility 
in march  we issued billion of senior unsecured notes in three maturity tranches one  three and five years  at million  million and million  respectively 
these notes are guaranteed by all of our subsidiaries that are not considered minor under securities and exchange commission sec regulations 
net proceeds from these borrowings were used to repay our commercial paper borrowings backed by the six month facility 
we canceled the six month credit facility in march at may   no commercial paper borrowings were outstanding and the entire billion under the revolving credit agreements was available for future borrowings 
our debt and revolving credit agreements contain certain covenants and restrictions  none of which are expected to affect our operations or ability to pay dividends 
during  million of senior unsecured notes matured and were paid 
in addition  million of existing unsecured debt at fedex express matured and was paid 
during the third quarter of  commercial paper borrowings of million were necessary to finance part of the cash contribution to our qualified pension plans 
all of the commercial paper borrowings were repaid by april  at may   no commercial paper was outstanding 
for more information regarding our credit facilities  see note of the accompanying audited financial statements 
we have a billion shelf registration statement with the sec to provide flexibility and efficiency when obtaining financing 
under this shelf registration statement we may issue  in one or more offerings  either unsecured debt securities  common stock or a combination of such instruments 
the entire billion is available for future financings 
cash used for share repurchases 
during and  our board of directors authorized us to buy back a total of million shares of common stock 
during the first half of  we repurchased million shares at an average price of per share  which decreased cash flows by approximately million 
no shares were repurchased during the second half of we repurchased million shares in at an average price of per share and this decreased cash flows by million 
during  we repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock  at a cost of approximately million or an average of per share 
based on our current financing strategy  we have significantly reduced the number of shares we expect to repurchase and instead are issuing new shares in connection with our equity compensation programs 
a total of million shares remain under existing share repurchase authorizations 
dividends 
our board of directors declared our first ever cash dividend on may  dividends paid in and were million and million  respectively 
on may   our board of directors declared a dividend of per share of common stock  an increase of per share over the previous dividend payment 
the dividend was paid on july  to stockholders of record as of the close of business on june  each quarterly dividend payment is subject to review and approval by our board of directors  and we intend to evaluate our dividend payment amount on an annual basis at the end of each fiscal year 
other liquidity information 
we believe that cash flow from operations  our commercial paper program and revolving bank credit facilities will adequately meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for the foreseeable future 
capital resources despite the recent decrease in capital spending  our operations remain capital intensive  characterized by significant investments in aircraft  vehicles  computer hardware and software and telecommunications equipment  package handling facilities and sort equipment 
the amount and timing of capital additions depend on various factors  including preexisting contractual commitments  anticipated volume growth  domestic and international economic conditions  new or enhanced services  geographical expansion of services  competition  availability of satisfactory financing and actions of regulatory authorities 
the following table compares capital expenditures by asset category and reportable segment for the years ended may in millions percent change aircraft and related equipment facilities and sort equipment information technology investments vehicles and other equipment total capital expenditures    fedex express segment fedex ground segment fedex freight segment fedex kinko s segment n a n a other total capital expenditures    capital expenditures were lower in  with the year over year decrease due to lower aircraft expenditures at fedex express  partially offset by an increase from network capacity expansion at fedex ground 
capital expenditures were lower during this decrease was primarily at the fedex express segment  where capital expenditures were lower 
we continued to make investments in fedex ground s infrastructure and information technology  and we also made capital investments to expand fedex freight 
our capital expenditures are expected to be approximately billion in  with much of the year over year increase coming from planned aircraft expenditures at fedex express to support ip volume growth 
we also continue to invest in infrastructure upgrades and scanning technologies  the multi year capacity expansion of the fedex ground network  expansion of the fedex kinko s network and replacement vehicle needs at fedex freight 
because of substantial lead times associated with the manufacture or modification of aircraft  we must generally plan our aircraft orders or modifications three to eight years in advance 
therefore  we must make commitments regarding our airlift requirements years before aircraft are actually needed 
we are closely managing our capital spending based on current and anticipated volume levels and will defer or limit capital additions where economically feasible  while continuing to invest strategically in growing business segments 
contractual cash obligations the following table sets forth a summary of our contractual cash obligations as of may  certain of these contractual obligations are reflected in our balance sheet  while others are disclosed as future obligations under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
excluding the current portion of long term debt and capital lease obligations  this table does not include amounts already recorded on our balance sheet as current liabilities at may  payments due by fiscal year there after total in millions amounts reflected in balance sheet long term debt  capital lease obligations other cash obligations not reflected in balance sheet unconditional purchase obligations operating leases       total       amounts do not include related interest 
see note for the applicable interest rates 
capital lease obligations represent principal and interest payments 
see note to the accompanying audited financial statements 
we have certain contingent liabilities that are not accrued in our balance sheet in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
these contingent liabilities are not included in the table above 
amounts reflected in balance sheet we have other commercial commitments  not reflected in the table above  that were incurred in the normal course of business to support our operations  including surety bonds and standby letters of credit 
these instruments are generally required under certain us self insurance programs and are used in the normal course of international operations 
while the notional amounts of these instruments are material  there are no additional contingent liabilities associated with them because the underlying liabilities are already reflected in our balance sheet 
we have certain operating leases that were arranged using variable interest entities under terms that are considered customary in the airline industry 
as discussed in note to the accompanying audited financial statements  we consolidated one of these entities in the second quarter of in accordance with fin as a result of this consolidation  the accompanying audited may  balance sheet includes an additional million of fixed assets and million of long term liabilities  and the payment of these debt obligations is included in the table above 
fedex express amended two leases for md aircraft during  which required fedex express to record million in both fixed assets and long term liabilities 
during  fedex express amended four leases for md aircraft  which now commits fedex express to firm purchase obligations for two of these aircraft during both and as a result  the amended leases were accounted for as capital leases  which added million to both fixed assets and long term liabilities at may  the future payments of these capital lease obligations are reflected in the table above 
we have other long term liabilities reflected in our balance sheet  including deferred income taxes  pension and postretirement healthcare liabilities and self insurance accruals 
the payment obligations associated with these liabilities are not reflected in the table above due to the absence of scheduled maturities 
therefore  the timing of these payments cannot be determined  except for amounts estimated to be payable in that are included in current liabilities 
other cash obligations not reflected in balance sheet the amounts reflected in the table above for purchase commitments represent noncancelable agreements to purchase goods or services 
such contracts include those for certain purchases of aircraft  aircraft modifications  vehicles  facilities  computers  printing and other equipment and advertising and promotions contracts 
open purchase orders that are cancelable are not considered unconditional purchase obligations for financial reporting purposes and are not included in the table above 
such purchase orders often represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
the amounts reflected in the table above for operating leases represent future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases principally aircraft and facilities with an initial or remaining term in excess of one year at may  in the past  we financed a significant portion of our aircraft needs and certain other equipment needs using operating leases a type of off balance sheet financing 
at the time that the decision to lease was made  we determined that these operating leases would provide economic benefits favorable to ownership with respect to market values  liquidity and after tax cash flows 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  our operating leases are not recorded in our balance sheet 
credit rating agencies routinely use this information concerning minimum lease payments required for our operating leases to calculate our debt capacity 
in addition  we have guarantees under certain operating leases  amounting to million as of may   for the residual values of vehicles and facilities at the end of the respective operating lease periods 
based upon our expectation that none of these leased assets will have a residual value at the end of the lease term that is materially less than the value specified in the related operating lease agreement  we do not believe it is probable that we will be required to fund any amounts under the terms of these guarantee arrangements 
accordingly  no accruals have been recognized for these guarantees 
in the future  other forms of secured financing and direct purchases may be used to obtain capital assets if we determine that they best suit our needs 
we have been successful in obtaining investment capital  both domestic and international  for long term leases on acceptable terms  although the marketplace for such capital can become restricted depending on a variety of economic factors 
we believe the capital resources available to us provide flexibility to access the most efficient markets for financing capital acquisitions  including aircraft  and are adequate for our future capital needs 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to adopt accounting policies and make significant judgments and estimates to develop amounts reflected and disclosed in the financial statements 
in many cases  there are alternative policies or estimation techniques that could be used 
we maintain a thorough process to review the application of our accounting policies and to evaluate the appropriateness of the many estimates that are required to prepare the financial statements of a large  global corporation 
however  even under optimal circumstances  estimates routinely require adjustment based on changing circumstances and the receipt of new or better information 
the policies and estimates discussed below include the financial statement elements that are either the most judgmental or involve the selection or application of alternative accounting policies and are material to our financial statements 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and with our independent registered public accounting firm 
pension cost we sponsor defined benefit pension plans covering a majority of our employees 
the accounting for pension benefits is determined by standardized accounting and actuarial methods that include numerous estimates  including discount rates  expected long term investment returns on plan assets  future salary increases  and employee turnover  mortality and retirement ages 
the determination of our annual pension cost is highly sensitive to changes in these estimates because we have a large  active workforce and we have a significant amount of assets in the pension plans 
for example  only of the participants covered under our principal pension plan are retired and currently receiving benefits and the average remaining service life of our employees approximates years normal retirement is at age 
therefore  the payout of pension benefits will occur over a long period in the future 
this long time period increases the sensitivity of our annual pension cost to changes in these key estimates 
total pension cost increased approximately million in and approximately million in primarily due to changes to these estimates 
for we expect a smaller increase approximately million  as actual asset returns have substantially improved the funded status of our pension plans in spite of a continued decline in the discount rate 
pension cost is included in the salaries and employee benefits caption in our income statements 
following are the components of pension cost recognized in our income statements in millions service cost interest cost expected return on plan assets net amortization and deferral following is a discussion of the estimates we consider most critical to determining our pension costs discount rate 
this is the interest rate used to discount the estimated future benefit payments that have been earned to date the projected benefit obligation to their net present value 
the discount rate is determined each year at the plan measurement date end of february and affects the succeeding year s pension cost 
a decrease in the discount rate has a negative effect on pension expense 
this assumption is highly sensitive for us as a one basis point change in the discount rate at february  affects our pension expense by approximately million and our accumulated benefit obligation by approximately million 
for example  the basis point decrease in the discount rate to for from for will negatively affect our pension cost by approximately million 
our pension cost was negatively affected by approximately million by the basis point decrease in the discount rate to for from for we determine the discount rate which is required to be the rate at which the projected benefit obligation could be effectively settled as of the measurement date with the assistance of actuaries  who calculate the yield on a theoretical portfolio of high grade corporate bonds with coupon payments and maturities that generally match our expected benefit payments 
this methodology is consistently applied and involves little subjectivity 
however  the calculated discount rate can change materially from year to year based on economic market conditions that impact yields on corporate bonds 
plan assets 
pension plan assets are invested primarily in listed securities 
our pension plans hold only a minimal investment in fedex common stock 
the estimated average rate of return on plan assets is a long term  forward looking assumption that also materially affects our pension cost 
it is intended to be the expected future long term rate of earnings on plan assets 
at february   with over billion of plan assets  a one basis point change in this assumption affects pension cost by approximately  a decrease in the assumed expected long term rate of return has a negative effect on pension expense 
establishing the expected future rate of investment return on our pension assets is a judgmental matter 
management considers the following factors in determining this assumption the duration of our pension plan liabilities  which drives the investment strategy we can employ with our pension plan assets 
the types of investment classes in which we invest our pension plan assets and the expected compound return we can reasonably expect those investment classes to earn over the next to year time period or such other time period that may be appropriate 
the investment returns we can reasonably expect our active investment management program to achieve in excess of the returns we could expect if investments were made strictly in indexed funds 
we review the expected long term rate of return on an annual basis and revise it as appropriate 
also  we periodically commission detailed asset liability studies performed by third party professional investment advisors and actuaries 
these studies project our estimated future pension payments and evaluate the efficiency of the allocation of our pension plan assets into various investment categories 
these studies also generate probability adjusted expected future returns on those assets 
the study performed for supported the reasonableness of our return assumption used for based on our liability duration and market conditions at the time we set this assumption in 
because of the introduction of the portable pension account discussed below for which will reduce our liability duration over time  as well as the significant additional contributions we made into the plans in late and the continuing deterioration of the equity markets through february   we performed a more recent asset liability study for  which supported a long term return on assets of 
the results of this study were reaffirmed for by our third party professional investment advisors and actuaries and support our current asset allocation strategy  which is summarized below asset class target of plan assets domestic equities international equities private equities total equities long duration fixed income securities other fixed income securities our allocation of assets at february  approximates the target allocation above 
our actual compound return on assets was for the year period ended march  based on these factors  we will retain as our estimated future rate of return on pension assets for the basis point decrease in the expected long term rate of return for negatively affected our pension cost by approximately million 
our pension cost was negatively affected by approximately million by the basis point decrease in the expected long term rate of return to for from for pension expense is also affected by the accounting policy used to determine the value of plan assets at the measurement date 
we use a calculated value method to determine the value of plan assets  which helps mitigate short term volatility in market performance both increases and decreases 
another method used in practice applies the market value of plan assets at the measurement date 
the application of the calculated value method reduced and pension cost by approximately million and million  respectively 
application of the calculated value method will approximate the market value method in salary increases 
the assumed future increase in salaries and wages is also a key estimate in determining pension cost 
we correlate changes in estimated future salary increases to changes in the discount rate since that is an indicator of general inflation and cost of living adjustments and general estimated levels of profitability since most incentive compensation is a component of pensionable wages 
for pension cost  a one basis point change in the rate of estimated future salaries affects pension cost by approximately  a decrease in this rate will decrease pension cost 
this assumption varies directly with the discount rate changes reflecting general inflation trends  however  the current rate is deemed to be at or near the floor based on current pay structures and improving company performance 
therefore  we will hold this assumption constant for determination of pension cost 
the decrease in this assumption to for from favorably impacted pension cost by approximately million 
following is information concerning the funded status of our pension plans as of may  and in millions funded status of plans accumulated benefit obligation abo qualified us domestic plans   other plans total abo   projected benefit obligation pbo fair value of plan assets   pbo in excess of plan assets  unrecognized actuarial losses  principally due to investments and changes in discount rate   unamortized prior service cost and other amounts included in balance sheets  components of amounts included in balance sheets prepaid pension cost   accrued pension liability minimum pension liability intangible asset and other net amounts recognized in balance sheets  cash amounts cash contributions during the year  benefit payments during the year the funded status of the plans reflects a snapshot of the state of our long term pension liabilities at the plan measurement date 
declining interest rates which increase the discounted value of the pbo and recent fluctuations in the stock market have significantly impacted the funded status of our plans 
however  our plans remain adequately funded to provide benefits to our employees as they come due and current benefit payments are nominal compared to our total plan assets benefit payments for were less than of plan assets at may  
although not legally required  we made million in contributions to our qualified us pension plans in compared to total contributions exceeding billion in our contributions were made to ensure our qualified pension plan assets exceeded the related accumulated benefit obligations at our february  plan measurement date 
currently  we do not expect any contributions for will be legally required 
based on the substantial improvement in the funded status of our qualified plans  we do not currently expect to contribute any funds to our qualified defined benefit plans in cumulative unrecognized actuarial losses were approximately billion through february   improved from billion at february  these unrecognized losses primarily reflect the declining discount rate and the declining stock market during  and these amounts may be recovered in future periods through actuarial gains 
however  to the extent that the discount rate remains low and market performance does not continue to improve  these unrecognized actuarial losses may be recognized in future periods 
the net amounts reflected in our balance sheet related to pension items include a substantial prepaid pension asset 
this results from excess cash contributions to the plans over amounts that are recognized as pension expense for financial accounting purposes 
amounts accrued as liabilities including minimum pension liabilities relate primarily to unfunded nonqualified plans and international pension plans where additional funding may not provide a current tax deduction 
effective in  we amended the fedex corporation employees pension plan to add a cash balance feature  which we call the portable pension account 
we expect the portable pension account will help reduce the long term growth of our pension liabilities 
all employees hired after may  will accrue benefits under the portable pension account formula 
eligible employees as of may  were able to choose between continuing to accrue benefits under the traditional pension benefit formula or accruing future benefits under the portable pension account formula 
the election was entirely optional 
there was no conversion of existing accrued benefits to a cash balance 
all benefits earned through may   including those applicable to employees electing the portable pension account  will be determined under a traditional pension plan formula 
accordingly  it will be several years before the impact of the lower benefit provided under this formula has a significant impact on our total pension expense 
under the portable pension account  the retirement benefit is expressed as a dollar amount in a notional account that grows with annual credits based on pay  age and years of credited service and interest on the notional account balance 
an employee s pay credits will be determined each year under a graded formula that combines age with years of service for points 
the plan interest credit rate will vary from year to year based on the selected us treasury maturity  with a minimum and a maximum based on the government rate 
employees are fully vested on completion of five years of service 
self insurance accruals we are self insured up to certain limits for costs associated with workers compensation claims  vehicle accidents and general business liabilities  and benefits paid under employee healthcare and long term disability programs 
at may  there were approximately billion of self insurance accruals reflected in our balance sheet million at may  
the measurement of these costs requires the consideration of historical cost experience and judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim 
we account for these costs primarily through actuarial methods  which develop estimates of the undiscounted liability for claims incurred  including those claims incurred but not reported 
these methods provide estimates of future ultimate claim costs based on claims incurred as of the balance sheet date 
other acceptable methods of accounting for these accruals include measurement of claims outstanding and projected payments 
we believe the use of actuarial methods to account for these liabilities provides a consistent and effective way to measure these highly judgmental accruals 
however  the use of any estimation technique in this area is inherently sensitive given the magnitude of claims involved and the length of time until the ultimate cost is known 
we believe our recorded obligations for these expenses are consistently measured on a conservative basis 
nevertheless  changes in healthcare costs  accident frequency and severity  and other factors can materially affect the estimates for these liabilities 
long lived assets property and equipment 
our key businesses are capital intensive 
more than of our total assets are invested in our transportation and information systems infrastructures 
we capitalize only those costs that meet the definition of capital assets under accounting standards 
accordingly  repair and maintenance costs that do not extend the useful life of an asset are expensed as incurred 
however  consistent with industry practice  we capitalize certain aircraft related costs on one of our aircraft fleet types and amortize these costs over their estimated service lives 
the depreciation or amortization of our capital assets over their estimated useful lives  and the determination of any salvage values  requires management to make judgments about future events 
because we utilize many of our capital assets over relatively long periods the majority of aircraft costs are depreciated over to years  we periodically evaluate whether adjustments to our estimated service lives or salvage values are necessary to ensure these estimates properly match the economic use of the asset 
this evaluation may result in changes in the estimated lives and residual values used to depreciate our aircraft and other equipment 
these estimates affect the amount of depreciation expense recognized in a period and  ultimately  the gain or loss on the disposal of the asset 
historically  gains and losses on operating equipment have not been material typically less than million annually 
however  such amounts may differ materially in the future due to technological obsolescence  accident frequency  regulatory changes and other factors beyond our control 
no material changes to the estimated lives and residual values were made during at various times during  as studies were completed  we made changes to the useful lives and residual values of certain aircraft fleet types  as well as tractors  trailers and other equipment 
these changes resulted in a decrease in depreciation expense of approximately million 
had all of these changes been made as of june   depreciation expense for would have decreased by an additional million 
because we must plan years in advance for future volume levels and make commitments for aircraft based on those projections  we have risks that asset capacity may exceed demand and that an impairment of our assets may occur 
the accounting test for whether an asset held for use is impaired involves first comparing the carrying value of the asset with its estimated future undiscounted cash flows 
if the cash flows do not exceed the carrying value  the asset must be adjusted to its current fair value 
because the cash flows of our transportation networks cannot be identified to individual assets  and based on the ongoing profitability of our operations  we have not experienced any significant impairment of assets to be held and used 
however  from time to time we make decisions to remove certain long lived assets from service based on projections of reduced capacity needs and those decisions may result in an impairment charge 
assets held for disposal must be adjusted to their estimated fair values when the decision is made to dispose of the asset and certain other criteria are met 
there were no material asset impairment charges recognized in  or leases 
we utilize operating leases to finance a significant number of our aircraft and fedex kinko s locations 
over the years  we have found these leasing arrangements to be favorable from a cash flow and risk management standpoint 
such arrangements typically shift the risk of loss on the residual value of the assets at the end of the lease period to the lessor 
as disclosed in contractual cash obligations and note to the accompanying audited financial statements  at may  we had approximately billion on an undiscounted basis of future commitments for payments under operating leases 
the future commitments for operating leases are not reflected as a liability in our balance sheet because the leases do not meet the accounting definition of capital leases 
the determination of whether a lease is accounted for as a capital lease or an operating lease requires management to make estimates primarily about the fair value of the asset and its estimated economic useful life 
we believe we have well defined and controlled processes for making this evaluation  including obtaining third party appraisals for material transactions 
goodwill 
we have approximately billion of goodwill on our balance sheet resulting from the acquisition of businesses  which includes approximately billion from our acquisition of fedex kinko s in new accounting standards adopted in require that we review this goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and cease all goodwill amortization 
as previously indicated  the adoption of these new rules resulted in an impairment of our recorded goodwill of million in at one of our smaller businesses 
the annual evaluation of goodwill impairment requires the use of estimates and assumptions to determine the fair value of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow methodology 
in particular  the following estimates used by management can significantly affect the outcome of the impairment test revenue growth rates  operating margin  discount rates and expected capital expenditures 
each year  independent of our goodwill impairment test  we update our weighted average cost of capital calculation and perform a long range planning analysis to project expected results of operations 
using this data  we complete a separate fair value analysis for each of our reporting units 
changes in forecasted operations and other assumptions could materially affect these estimates 
we compare the fair value of our reporting units to the carrying value  including goodwill  of each of those units 
since the acquisition of fedex kinko s occurred near the end of  we did not test its goodwill for impairment in we will include the related goodwill in our annual impairment test  which  unless circumstances otherwise dictate  will be performed in the fourth quarter of we performed our annual impairment tests in and for our other reporting units 
the fair value of our reporting units exceeded the carrying value  including goodwill  of each of those units  therefore  no impairment charge was necessary 
intangible asset with an indefinite life 
the estimated fair value of our intangible asset with an indefinite life was million  consisting of the estimated fair value allocated to the kinko s trade name 
this intangible asset will not be amortized because it has an indefinite remaining useful life based on the length of time that the kinko s name had been in use  the kinko s brand awareness and market position and the plans for continued use of the kinko s brand 
we must review this asset for impairment on an annual basis 
this annual evaluation requires the use of estimates about the future cash flows attributable to the kinko s trade name to determine the estimated fair value of the trade name 
changes in forecasted operations and changes in discount rates can materially affect this estimate 
however  once an impairment of this intangible asset has been recorded  it cannot be reversed 
unless circumstances otherwise dictate  we plan to perform our first annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of revenue recognition we believe the policies adopted to recognize revenue are critical because an understanding of the accounting applied in this area is fundamental to assessing our overall financial performance and because revenue and revenue growth are key measures of financial performance in the marketplace 
our businesses are primarily involved in the direct pickup and delivery of commercial package and freight shipments  as well as providing document solutions and business services 
our employees and agents are involved throughout the process and our operational  billing and accounting systems directly capture and control all relevant information necessary to record revenue  bill customers and collect amounts due to us 
we recognize revenue upon delivery of shipments or  for our business services  logistics and trade services businesses  upon the completion of services 
transportation industry practice includes two predominant methods for revenue recognition for shipments in process at the end of an accounting period recognize all revenue and the related delivery costs when shipments are delivered or recognize a portion of the revenue earned for shipments that have been picked up but not yet delivered at period end and accrue delivery costs as incurred 
we use the second method  we recognize the portion of revenue earned at the balance sheet date for shipments in transit and accrue all delivery costs as incurred 
we believe this accounting policy effectively and consistently matches revenue with expenses and recognizes liabilities as incurred 
there are three key estimates that are included in the recognition and measurement of our revenue and related accounts receivable under the policies described above estimates for unbilled revenue on shipments that have been delivered  estimates for revenue associated with shipments in transit  and estimates for future adjustments to revenue or accounts receivable for billing adjustments and bad debts 
unbilled revenue 
primarily due to cycle billings to some of our larger customers  there is a time lag between the completion of a shipment and the generation of an invoice 
at the end of a month  unprocessed invoices may be as much as one third of the total month s revenue 
this revenue is recognized through systematic accrual processes 
invoices that are essentially complete represent most of these accruals  with little subjectivity over the amounts accrued 
the remaining amounts are estimated using actual package or shipment volumes and current trends of average revenue per shipment 
these estimates are adjusted in subsequent months to the actual amounts invoiced 
because of the low level of subjectivity inherent in these accrual processes  the estimates have historically not varied significantly from actual amounts subsequently invoiced 
shipments in process 
the majority of our shipments have short cycle times  therefore  less than of a total month s revenue is typically in transit at the end of a period 
we periodically perform studies to measure the percentage of completion for shipments in process 
at month end  we estimate the amount of revenue earned on shipments in process based on actual shipments picked up  the scheduled day of delivery  the day of the week on which the month ends which affects the percentage of completion and current trends in our average price for the respective services 
we believe these estimates provide a reasonable approximation of the actual revenue earned at the end of a period 
future adjustments to revenue and accounts receivable 
like many companies  we experience some credit loss on our trade accounts receivable 
historically  our credit losses from bad debts have not fluctuated materially because our credit management processes have been highly effective 
we also recognize billing adjustments to revenue and accounts receivable for certain discounts  money back service guarantees and billing corrections 
estimates for credit losses and billing adjustments are regularly updated based on historical experience of bad debts  adjustments processed and current collections trends 
total allowances for these future adjustments were million at may  and million at may  we consider the sensitivity and subjectivity of these estimates to be moderate  as changes in economic conditions  pricing arrangements and billing systems can significantly affect the estimates used to determine the allowances

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk while we currently have market risk sensitive instruments related to interest rates  we have no significant exposure to changing interest rates on our long term debt because the interest rates are fixed on the majority of our long term debt 
we had approximately million of outstanding floating rate borrowings at may  we have not employed interest rate hedging to mitigate the risks with respect to these borrowings 
a hypothetical increase in the interest rate on our outstanding floating rate borrowings would not have a material effect on our results of operations 
as disclosed in note to the accompanying audited financial statements  we had outstanding fixed rate  long term debt exclusive of capital leases of billion at may  and billion at may  market risk for fixed rate  long term debt is estimated as the potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical increase in interest rates and amounts to approximately million as of may  and million as of may  the underlying fair values of our long term debt were estimated based on quoted market prices or on the current rates offered for debt with similar terms and maturities 
while we are a global provider of transportation  e commerce and business services  the substantial majority of our transactions are denominated in us dollars 
the distribution of our foreign currency denominated transactions is such that currency declines in some areas of the world are often offset by currency gains of equal magnitude in other areas of the world 
the principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed are in the japanese yen  taiwan dollar  canadian dollar and euro 
during and  we believe operating income was positively impacted due to foreign currency fluctuations 
however  favorable foreign currency fluctuations also may have had an offsetting impact on the price we obtained or the demand for our services 
at may   the result of a uniform strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease in operating income of approximately million for the comparable amount in the prior year was approximately million 
this increase is primarily due to the strong growth of our international operations 
this theoretical calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar 
in practice  our experience is that exchange rates in the principal foreign markets where we have foreign currency denominated transactions tend to have offsetting fluctuations 
therefore  the calculation above is not indicative of our actual experience in foreign currency transactions 
in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates  which are a changed dollar value of the resulting reported operating results  changes in exchange rates also affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors services become more or less attractive 
the sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency prices 
we have market risk for changes in the price of jet and diesel fuel  however  this risk is largely mitigated by revenue from our fuel surcharges 
in  we implemented new indices for calculating us domestic fuel surcharges  which more closely link the fuel surcharges to prevailing market prices for fuel 
in  we implemented this methodology for determining a fuel surcharge on international shipments as well 
therefore  a hypothetical change in the price of fuel would not be expected to materially affect our earnings 
however  our fuel surcharges have a lag that exists before they are adjusted for changes in jet fuel prices and fuel prices can fluctuate within certain ranges before resulting in a change in our fuel surcharges 
therefore  our operating income may be affected should the spot price of fuel suddenly change by a significant amount or change by amounts that do not result in a change in our fuel surcharges 
we do not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes
