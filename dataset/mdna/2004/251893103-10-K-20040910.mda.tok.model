item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of the company s results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the company and the notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
fiscal year financial performance was affected by the continued softness in demand for technology programs at our undergraduate campuses although enrollments in business and management programs at our devry university centers and devry university online continued to grow 
new teaching locations and academic programs were added during the year  which reflects key elements of our growth strategy 
financial performance for the year was also affected by the change in the cpa exam format and schedule at becker professional review 
these changes resulted in less revenue and income as students deferred enrollment in our review courses until future periods 
in may  the company completed the acquisition of dominica management  inc  which owns and operates the ross university school of medicine and ross university school of veterinary medicine 
the amounts recorded at june  relating to the acquisition were adjusted in fiscal based upon the final valuation of assets and the actual working capital at the closing date 
ross university provides the company with a high quality entry into healthcare education 
campus expansion is underway at both the medical and veterinary schools to accommodate the growing demand for enrollment 
changes to our management structure at july  were designed to help us improve the way we operate and allow us to begin putting elements of our succession plan in place 
the shared role of chief executive officer  previously held by dennis keller and ronald taylor  will now be held solely by ronald taylor  with dennis keller remaining as chairman of the board of directors 
daniel hamburger  who joined the company in fiscal  was named president and chief operating officer of devry inc and john skubiak  who has been with the company since was appointed president of devry university 
the company further enhanced its management talent with the addition of paul eppen as chief marketing officer  who is expected to improve our marketing and student recruitment efforts

interest expense total costs and expenses income before taxes income tax provision non recurring tax benefits net income total consolidated revenues for fiscal set a new record  increasing by million  or  from last year 
approximately of the increase in revenue was generated by the ross university medical and veterinary school operations that the company acquired in may and were not included in fiscal results until the final six weeks of the year  from its mid may date of acquisition until june  tuition revenues  which are the largest component of total revenues  increased by million  or  from fiscal as with total revenues  most of the increase was generated by the ross university segment but the devry university segment also contributed to this increase 
tuition revenue is reported net of tuition refunds 
revenues in the devry university segment increased by million  or from the previous year 
the increase is primarily the result of higher enrollments and higher tuition pricing at keller graduate school 
revenues at keller were higher than last year  in part  because of the july conversion in course length from ten weeks to eight weeks as the graduate program academic calendar was aligned with the devry university calendar 
this change in course length increased the number of terms each year from five to six  and correspondingly increases revenue by for the year assuming that all students proceeded through the year with continuous enrollment at the accelerated six term pace 
for fiscal  total graduate courses taken increased by more than as a result of the change in course length and higher student enrollments in each term 
revenues for the devry university segment also increased slightly from last year because of tuition price increases  in july and march of approximately each  offsetting somewhat lower total undergraduate enrollments 
undergraduate total student enrollments for the term that began in november were lower than last year and undergraduate total student enrollments for the term that began in march were lower than last year 
although new student undergraduate enrollments were higher than last year in both of the final two terms of the year cited above  the increases have been in online programs and programs at devry university center locations that are designed to serve working adult students 
these students more typically enroll for less than a full time academic load  and accordingly  they pay a somewhat lesser tuition amount than students at the undergraduate campus locations 
even though undergraduate enrollments in business programs continue to increase  the company believes that declines in enrollment in its technology programs at its campus locations have been caused by past reductions in technology field employment  which decreased applicant interest in these fields 
during the year  a new undergraduate campus was opened in houston  texas  and several new devry university center locations were opened or expanded 
at the start of the summer term  which is the beginning of fiscal  graduate coursetakers increased from last year by to  however  total undergraduate enrollments of  remained below the level of the previous year  declining by from the summer term in fiscal that were  on a continuing operation basis  excluding the students at the mississauga toronto  canada  campus that did not accept new students after the summer term of last year  the decline in total enrollment from last year was 
other educational revenue declined by million  or  from the previous year 
other educational revenue is composed primarily of the sale of books and supplies in connection with the company s educational programs  including the becker cpa review course on cd rom and other cpa and cfa review study materials  application and other non refundable fees and interest or payment deferral charges on students outstanding accounts receivable balances 
the decrease in revenue from last year occurred primarily in the devry university segment where lower undergraduate enrollments and a further outsourcing of book sales  as discussed more fully below  affected this source of revenue 
devry university entered into an agreement with follett higher education group follett several years ago to manage some of the undergraduate on campus bookstores 
the wider range of ancillary merchandise and experienced retail store management available from follett are believed to provide an improved level of student service 
devry university receives a commission from follett based upon the level of bookstore sales at these campuses 
at fiscal year end  follett was managing campus bookstores 
sales at follett managed bookstores  net of commissions to devry university  were approximately million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal during fiscal  sales of books to students enrolled in online courses and at some devry university centers was managed by a different company under a similar commission agreement 
the company has entered into an agreement with follett to manage the remaining campus bookstores and its online and center book sales  with the transition occurring over several quarters in fiscal at becker professional review in the professional and training segment  revenues decreased from the previous year by more than million dollars 
effective with calendar year  the twice a year  paper and pencil cpa exam format is no longer being offered 
instead  the exam is now available on demand almost year round in a new computer based format 
candidates may choose to take the four exam sections individually and at different times 
while this provides greater flexibility for candidates sitting for the exam  it may extend the time over which exam candidates take review courses  such as those offered by becker and  therefore  extends the period over which review course revenue is earned 
the company also believes that some exam candidates delayed taking the new exam so as to benefit from the experiences of the first of the takers of the new format exam  thus reducing enrollments and revenues in the third and fourth quarter 
however  the company expects that the number of exam candidates will increase from these reduced levels over the period of the next several quarters 
ross university segment revenues were included in fiscal for the entire year 
in fiscal  ross university segment revenues were included only for the six week period from the date of its acquisition until the end of the fiscal year 
interest income on the company s short term investments of cash balances decreased by million from fiscal the decrease is due to lower interest rates available on investments and the use of most cash balances to offset bank service fees rather than for short term investments 
the company s cost of educational services increased by million  or  from fiscal cost of educational services includes the cost of faculty and related staff that represents more than half of this expense category 
also included in this expense category are the costs of facilities  supplies  bookstore and other educational materials  student education related support activities and the provision for uncollectible student accounts 
the increase in this expense category includes a full year of cost of operations at ross university that was not a part of the company for most of the previous fiscal year 
cost increases were incurred through all of the company s previously existing operations  and costs associated with new devry university centers  the undergraduate houston campus that opened in september and a growing online student enrollment requiring additional faculty and staff to support this growing method of delivery 
at the new devry undergraduate campuses in philadelphia and south florida that were opened in the first half of last fiscal year  additional faculty and staff are being hired as students progress into the higher terms of their educational programs 
for the keller graduate school term that began in may  courses were taught in seven new locations compared to the april term of last year 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company incurred charges of approximately million related to work force reductions in the eastern canada and us operations 
no such charges were incurred during the current fiscal year 
however  in the second quarter of fiscal  the company recognized an approximately million pre tax loss from asset impairment on the furniture and laboratory equipment associated with the company s toronto area operations 
under its agreement with rcc college of technology for the teachout of the devry student programs that allows students to complete their program of study  this equipment may become the future property of rcc and will have no further useful life for devry beyond the period of the teachout 
additions to land  buildings and equipment were million in fiscal as the company continued its investment in new and expanded facilities and equipment for students and staff 
as a result of these and previous years additions to facilities and equipment  depreciation expense  most of which is included in cost of educational services  increased by million compared to last year  after increasing by million in fiscal from fiscal fiscal depreciation expense included a million pre tax impairment loss on long lived leasehold improvements in the company s canadian operations 
student services and administrative expense increased by million  or from last year 
student services and administrative expense includes the costs of new student recruiting  general and administrative costs  expenses associated with curriculum development and the amortization expense of finite lived intangible assets related to acquisitions of businesses  including the acquisition of ross university 
amortization expense in fiscal was million compared to only million in fiscal the increase in expense also includes marketing and administration at ross university for a full year compared to just the six week period at the end of last fiscal year 
the increased expense also reflects the higher advertising and selling costs associated with efforts to generate more new student enrollments  primarily in devry university s undergraduate educational programs 
the company believes that recent reductions in technology field employment decreased applicant interest in these fields  requiring the company to increase the level of its recruitment activity to maintain enrollments 
expenditures for new student recruitment are charged to expense as incurred 
the company believes that increased expenditures for new student recruitment were largely responsible for the increases in new undergraduate student enrollments for the past several terms 
for the undergraduate term that began in july  that is the start of the company s fiscal  new student undergraduate enrollments increased by from last year  excluding the final admission last july of new students to the now discontinued toronto area operations 
for the previous two undergraduate term that began in march and november  new student undergraduate enrollments increased by and  respectively  from last year in the final terms before new students were no longer being accepted in toronto 
information systems development costs are also included in student services and administrative expense 
in response to the growing size and complexity of its varied educational program offerings  the company continued its development and implementation of a new student information system to better support the educational process and supporting activities 
in accordance with accounting principles for internal software development costs  certain wage and outside consulting costs associated with this project are being capitalized 
indirect expenses  such as training and employee communication  are being charged directly to expense as incurred 
at the end of fiscal  costs capitalized totaled million  of which million was capitalized in the current year 
this compares to million of total capitalized costs at the end of fiscal  of which million was capitalized in that year 
many of the elements of this system have now been placed into service and the capitalized costs are being amortized to expense over the estimated useful life of each program element  but not exceeding five years 
amortization began in the fourth quarter of fiscal in fiscal  amortization expense totaled million compared to million in the previous year 
cumulatively  a total of million has been amortized to expense through the end of fiscal in addition to the amounts amortized to expense  million of related but indirect activity costs were charged directly to expense in fiscal this compares to million charged directly to expense in the previous year 
one of the company s directors is also an investor in and a director of a consulting firm engaged by the company to assist with system development projects  including the new student information system 
fees paid to this consulting firm have been negotiated to a level believed to be comparable to those charged to similar customers 
fees paid to this consulting firm during fiscal and were approximately million and million  respectively 
as the student information system moves from its development phase to deployment  the company estimates that fees to be paid to this consulting firm in the coming year will decrease somewhat from those paid in fiscal in the devry university segment  operating income and the operating margin declined from last year 
contributing to the year s lower earnings were the lesser total undergraduate student enrollments discussed above and increased spending on undergraduate new student recruiting to increase future term enrollments 
income was also affected by the increased number of new teaching locations and expanding educational operations to support the increased enrollments in online programs 
although spending at the undergraduate campuses was curtailed as enrollments declined  significant fixed costs of operation  such as facility related costs  were not able to be reduced 
also affecting income was the recognition of a million pre tax asset impairment loss on the toronto area furniture and laboratory equipment used under the teachout agreement with rcc as discussed above 
this agreement has reduced the company s operating losses at the toronto campus below what such losses were under company management in fiscal and below what the losses would have been if the company continued to manage the educational process and services through the current year 
partly offsetting these factors in the undergraduate operations was the positive effect on margins from higher enrollments at keller graduate school and from the positive effect on income from the conversion to an eight week term length aligned with the common devry university calendar as discussed above 
additionally  price increases of approximately for both undergraduate and graduate students were implemented in july and another price increase was implemented for the term that began in march in the professional and training segment  operating income declined by almost million from last year because of the effects on enrollment and revenues from the change in the cpa exam format and schedule as discussed above 
also  cost increases for development of the new cpa exam format materials adversely affected income for the year 
because of the change to the cpa exam schedule  the company believes that the historical becker operating year that ended in april with the administration of the spring cpa exam is no longer the most appropriate fiscal year end 
effective with the company s fiscal  the becker fiscal year will be aligned with the june year end of devry inc this change in accounting will be implemented and reported in the first quarter of fiscal the cumulative effect of this change in accounting is expected to add approximately per share for the first quarter and total year of fiscal income from the ross university acquisition was first incorporated into the company s financial results in the fourth quarter of fiscal following completion of its may acquisition 
for the current fiscal year  ross university contributed million of operating income  or a margin  before interest expense and amortization expense of intangible assets associated with its acquisition 
interest expense increased by million from last year because of the fourth quarter of fiscal borrowings for the acquisition of ross university 
during the year  borrowings were reduced by million to million using existing cash balances and cash generated from operations 
short term interest rates  that serve as the basis for the interest rate on this debt  remained low during fiscal but have now begun to increase 
the company intends to make further debt reductions during fiscal  which should offset the effect of higher interest rates 
taxes on income were of pretax income for the year compared to last year 
in fiscal  the company recognized non recurring tax benefits of million associated with the restructuring of its canadian operations 
without this non recurring benefit  the tax rate for fiscal would have been 
the company s tax rate on income is the composite of state and federal taxes on operations other than from ross university and a single digit rate on the earnings of ross university  most of which is earned offshore in jurisdictions where the company has agreements with those governments that exempt ross earnings from local income taxes 
for the foreseeable future  the company intends to reinvest the ross university earnings and cash flow to reduce outstanding debt  improve and expand facilities and operations at the schools  and pursue future business opportunities outside the united states 
accordingly  the company has not recorded a current provision for the payment of us income taxes on these earnings 
fiscal year ended june  vs 
fiscal year ended june  total consolidated revenues for fiscal set a new record  increasing by million  or  from fiscal in may  the company completed the acquisition of dominica management  inc dmi for million 
dmi owns and operates the ross university school of medicine and the ross university school of veterinary medicine  operating in the caribbean countries of dominica and st 
kitts nevis  respectively 
ross university is one of the world s largest providers of medical and veterinary medical education with over  students at the date of acquisition 
ross university operations contributed million in revenues for the period from date of acquisition to the end of the fiscal year 
tuition revenues  which are the largest component of total revenues  increased by million  or  from fiscal tuition revenue is reported net of tuition refunds 
compared to previous years  the lesser rate of increase in tuition revenue during fiscal was caused by reduced enrollments in the company s undergraduate technology programs 
other educational revenue increased by in fiscal compared to the previous year 
other educational revenue is composed primarily of the sale of books and supplies  including the becker cpa review course on cd rom and other cpa and cfa review study materials  application and other non refundable fees and interest or payment deferral charges on students outstanding accounts receivable balances 
the increased revenue results primarily from a higher enrollment fee charged to new students and increased sales of books and supplies for the cpa and cfa exam reviews  as increased numbers of students enrolled in the company s exam preparation courses 
interest income on the company s short term investments of cash balances decreased by million from fiscal to million 
the decrease is due to lower interest rates available on investments and the application of some cash balances to offset bank service fees 
in addition  a portion of the company s cash balances in may and june were utilized to complete the acquisition of dmi 
the company s principal business is providing postsecondary education 
prior to the acquisition of dmi  the company had presented its financial results in two reportable segments  devry university undergraduate and graduate programs in business and technology and professional and training becker cpa  cma and cfa exam reviews  and corporate training 
with the may acquisition of dmi  the company presents the financial results of these medical program operations for fiscal in a third reportable segment 
devry university segment revenues increased by million  or  from the previous year 
contributing to the increased revenue was an increase of nearly in coursetakers in graduate management programs for the five terms of compared to however  partly offsetting this increase  total undergraduate enrollment for the three terms of decreased approximately from the previous year 
although undergraduate enrollments in business programs continue to increase  the company believes that declines in enrollment in its technology programs have been caused by reductions in technology field employment that has decreased applicant interest in these fields 
new undergraduate campus openings in philadelphia  pa  miramar  fl  and denver  co  plus an expanded number of devry university centers and increased online student enrollments helped reduce the effect of lower enrollment in the company s technology programs 
tuition rate increases of approximately also helped offset the effect of lower enrollments 
at the start of the summer term  which is the beginning of fiscal  graduate coursetakers increased from the previous year by to  however  total undergraduate enrollments of  remained below the fiscal summer term level of  down 
this compares to a decline of in total undergraduate enrollments for the spring term  which was the last term of fiscal  compared to the spring term 
devry university entered into an agreement with follett higher education group follett several years ago to manage some of the undergraduate on campus bookstores and provide internet ordering capability to students at these campuses 
the wider range of ancillary merchandise and experienced retail store management available from follett are believed to provide an improved level of student service 
devry university receives a commission from follett based upon the level of bookstore sales at these campuses 
at fiscal year end  follett was managing campus bookstores  including two of the new campuses opened during the year 
sales at campus bookstores under follett management  net of commissions paid to devry university  were approximately million in fiscal  compared to million in the previous year 
responsibility for managing additional campus bookstores may be transferred to follett in the future  based upon the needs of each campus 
in addition  sales of books to students enrolled in devry university online courses and some devry university centers are managed by a different company 
devry university also receives a commission based upon the level of these bookstore sales 
in the professional and training segment  revenues increased by million  or  from fiscal following a increase in revenues in the previous year 
increased numbers of students taking the becker cpa review and stalla cfa review courses in the classroom  on cd rom or online  and an increased course price of approximately five percent all contributed to the increased revenue 
in fiscal  cost of educational services increased by million  or  from the previous year 
cost of educational services includes the cost of faculty and related staff  which represents approximately of the expense category 
more than half of the increase in this expense category was the result of higher wages and benefits to faculty and staff in all of the company s operations 
also included in this expense category are the costs of facilities  supplies  bookstore and other educational materials  student education related support activities and the provision for uncollectible accounts 
ross university expenses of a similar nature are included in this expense category for the six week period subsequent to its acquisition 
in the fourth quarter of  charges of approximately million related to work force reductions in the company s eastern canada and us operations were included in this expense category as the company adjusted the size of its employee base to better match enrollments and revenues 
additions to long lived assets in devry university were million as the company continued its investment in new and expanded facilities and equipment for students and staff 
as a result of these and previous additions to facilities and equipment  depreciation expense in devry university  most of which is included in cost of educational services  increased by million  or in fiscal  after increasing million  or  in the previous year 
contributing to the increased depreciation expense in fiscal was the recognition during the second quarter of an approximately million impairment loss on long lived leasehold improvements in the company s canadian operations 
the recognition of this impairment loss followed an assessment of the expected future results and cash flows of the canadian operations  where enrollment declines have adversely affected financial results 
student services and administrative expense increased by million  or  from fiscal student services and administrative expense includes the costs of new student recruiting  general and administrative costs and expenses associated with curriculum development 
the increased spending primarily reflects higher advertising and selling costs associated with efforts to generate more new student enrollments in the company s educational programs for the terms that began in fiscal and for the summer term of fiscal ross university expenses of a similar nature are also included in this expense category for the six week period subsequent to its acquisition 
in addition  million of amortization expense of finite lived intangible assets related to the ross acquisition is included in this expense category 
in fiscal  the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 entitled goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets arising from a business combination are no longer amortized and charged to expense over time 
instead  as required by sfas  goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles must be reviewed annually for impairment  or more frequently if circumstances arise indicating potential impairment 
as of june   the company  with the assistance of an independent professional valuation specialist  determined that there was no impairment loss in the reporting units represented by the company s three operating segments 
as previously explained  the company believes that reductions in technology field employment have lessened applicant interest in these fields  requiring the company to increase the level of its recruitment activity to maintain enrollments 
generally  expenditures for new student recruitment  which are charged to expense as incurred  precede the time periods in which revenue is generated by these new student enrollments 
the company believes that increased expenditures for new student recruitment were largely responsible for the increase in new undergraduate student enrollments in the summer term of fiscal  up from the previous summer term 
included in student services and administrative expense was an approximately million charge to reflect the accrual for current year costs relating to employment agreements completed in the second quarter with the company s co chief executive officers 
this accrual is based on recording the present value of the company s obligation to the co chief executive officers over their period of future active service 
also  in response to the growing size and complexity of its educational programs  including the expanded number of devry university centers and online student enrollments  the company continued its design and development of a new student information system to better support the educational process and supporting activities 
information system development costs related to this project have increased from last year as the project nears implementation in fiscal in accordance with accounting principles for internal software development costs  certain wage and outside consulting service costs are being capitalized 
indirect expenses  such as training and employee communication  are charged directly to expense as incurred 
at the end of fiscal  costs capitalized to date were million  of which million was capitalized during the current fiscal year 
this compares to million capitalized during the previous year 
in addition to the amounts capitalized  million of related but indirect activity costs were charged directly to expense  up from million charged directly to expense in the previous year 
some elements of the overall system have already been placed into service 
amortization began in the fourth quarter of fiscal year over the expected useful lives of each program element  but not exceeding five years 
approximately million of amortization expense was recognized during fiscal one of the company s directors is also an investor in and director of a consulting firm engaged by the company to assist with systems development projects  including the new student information system 
fees paid to this consulting firm have been negotiated to a level believed to be comparable to those charged to similar customers 
fees paid to this consulting firm during the current fiscal year were approximately million  compared to approximately million paid in fiscal the company estimates that fees to be paid to this consulting firm in fiscal will be reduced somewhat from the level incurred in as these system projects are being placed into service 
in the devry university segment  both operating income and operating margin as a percent of revenue declined from the previous year 
operating margins declined from in fiscal to in fiscal as operating income decreased by million  due largely to the lower number of undergraduate enrollments and the higher level of spending on student recruitment to reverse the new and total student enrollment declines that occurred during fiscal the operations of ross university were acquired by the company in may and their results of operations have been included in the company s results for the final six weeks of the year 
ross university operations for this period  net of amortization of intangible assets  interest expense on company borrowings for the acquisition and taxes on income as appropriate  were accretive to the overall company financial results 
in the professional and training segment  operating income in fiscal increased by million  or  from the previous year 
operating margins increased from to as operating efficiencies were realized from increased numbers of students enrolled for the exam review courses and from higher tuition pricing 
interest expense increased by million as borrowings for the ross acquisition in mid fourth quarter of the fiscal year generated additional expense 
taxes on income  before the non recurring benefit related to the company s canadian operations and described more fully below  were accrued at a rate of  compared to last year 
contributing to the fiscal lower tax rate were certain business incentive tax credits 
also  in february of the company restructured and continued its canadian subsidiary into the us tax jurisdiction and domesticated it as a limited liability company generating current us tax benefits for the losses of the llc beginning in march 
the ross university school of medicine  operating in the commonwealth of dominica  and the ross university school of veterinary medicine  operating in the federation of st 
christopher nevis  st 
kitts  both have agreements with their respective governments that exempt them from local income taxation through the years and  respectively 
accordingly  no current provision for foreign income taxes was provided 
the company has also not recorded a tax provision for the undistributed earnings of the schools since the date of acquisition because it is the company s intention to indefinitely reinvest these earnings to service debt  improve and expand the facilities and operations of the schools and pursue future investment opportunities outside of the united states 
the company s future composite tax rate will reflect the combination of both an estimated tax liability at an approximately rate historically experienced on company operations other than ross university and no tax liability on the ross university operations in their home caribbean countries 
all of the amortization of intangible assets associated with the ross acquisition  and the interest expense on the portion of the borrowings held by an offshore subsidiary  are attributable to the ross earnings that are exempt from income taxes and thus do not generate a tax benefit in any taxing jurisdiction 
during the second quarter  the company recorded approximately million of net non recurring tax benefits related to its canadian operations 
the company assessed the expected future results of its devry university canadian operations including future cash flows and taxable income 
this assessment included an analysis of the previously recorded canadian deferred tax assets 
these deferred tax assets consisted primarily of net operating loss carryforwards and a tax basis higher than book basis for property and equipment 
based upon this assessment  it was determined that a valuation allowance of percent was required for these deferred tax assets 
this resulted in an additional income tax expense provision of approximately million 
also during the second quarter  the company determined  based upon this same assessment  that it would deduct the full amount of the tax basis of its investment in its canadian subsidiary 
this reflects the negative value ascribed to the investment as determined by the independent valuations of the business that were undertaken as a part of the assessment 
the us income tax deduction results in a tax benefit totaling approximately million 
the net effect of these two actions associated with the canadian investment and operations is a net tax benefit of approximately million  categorized as non recurring tax benefits in the statements of income 
net income for the year of million decreased by million from the previous year 
earnings per share declined from per share diluted in the previous year to per share diluted in fiscal primarily as a result of the previously discussed lower undergraduate enrollments and increased spending on new student recruitment offset  in part  by the previously discussed net canadian tax benefit equal to approximately per share 
in august  the company announced that its subsidiary  devry canada llc  had signed a letter of intent with rcc college of technology rcc that would enable devry to phase out its operations at its toronto campus  commencing with the term that began in november an agreement was subsequently finalized with rcc for the management of the completion of programs of study for the remaining students at the toronto campus 
july was the last term for which new students were admitted to the toronto campus 
application of critical accounting policies note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended june   describes in detail the method of application of the critical accounting policies listed below 
devry university tuition and technology fees and ross university tuition revenues are recognized ratably on a straight line basis over the applicable academic term 
tuition and other refunds are reported as a reduction of revenues 
textbook and other educational supply sales are recognized when the sale occurs 
inventory is valued using the first in  first out method of accounting 
advertising costs are charged to expense in the period in which materials are purchased or services are rendered 
similarly  all start up expenses related to new operating locations and new curriculum development costs are also charged directly to expense as incurred 
the costs associated with developing the company s new student information system are being capitalized in accordance with the rules on accounting for costs of computer software developed for internal use 
fixed asset acquisitions are recorded at cost 
depreciation is computed on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset 
stock based compensation is accounted for using the intrinsic value approach of apb and all required disclosures relative to such compensation and its pro forma effect on earnings are disclosed in the footnotes to the financial statements 
in accordance with sfas  entitled goodwill and other intangible assets  the company annually undertakes an assessment of the fair value of its reporting units compared to their carrying value for potential impairment of goodwill  and of the fair value compared to carrying value of intangible assets arising from a business combination 
this assessment is performed either annually  or more frequently if circumstances require  with the assistance of an independent professional valuation specialist 
the valuation is based upon several factors including estimates of future revenues and earnings  a discounted cash flow anlysis for several years into the future  and includes other assumptions such as future income tax and interest discount rates 
such estimates require significant judgment  and over the period of future years  actual results may differ from these estimates 
although management believes that its estimates are appropriate  decreases in earnings and cash flow from these estimates and or significant changes in other assumptions underlying the analysis could result in impairment charges in future periods 
at june  intangible assets from business combinations equaled million  and goodwill equaled million 
together these assets equal approximately of total assets  and any impairment could significantly affect future results of operation 
the company s financial statements include estimates and assumptions about the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses whose exact amounts will not be known until future periods 
actual amounts may differ from the estimates included in the financial statements 
significant estimates included in the company s financial statements include the method of revenue recognition across the academic periods  determining the useful lives of equipment and facilities whose value is a significant portion of the company s total assets  determining the value and useful lives of acquired finite lived intangible assets  determining the value of indefinite lived intangible assets  determining the pattern of the amortization of finite lived intangible assets over their economic life  estimating losses to be realized in the future on the collection of presently owed student receivable balances  estimating costs associated with any settlement of law suits in which the company is a defendant and estimating health care reimbursement claims for medical services rendered but not yet processed or paid 
the methodology by which each of these estimates has been determined for fiscal is consistent with the manner in which such estimates were made in prior years although the parameters used in setting the value of these estimates is analyzed and may change as current conditions warrant 
variances from estimate to actual expense for these items in past years have not been material 
although different assumptions about the parameters affecting each of these estimates could produce a different amount of estimate  the reasonably determined range of estimates for each item would generally not be large enough to materially change the overall company reported financial results 
contingencies the company is subject to occasional lawsuits  investigations and claims arising in the normal conduct of its business 
in september  the company received a notice from acacia research corporation claiming patent infringement 
the notice alleges that the company has infringed upon several acacia patents relating to streaming audio and video technology 
this technology was allegedly used by the company through its online education provider and is also used by many other companies in conjunction with the delivery of online programs 
the company has had discussion with acacia relating to this claim and does not believe that it had infringed upon the acacia patents 
in march  the company received notice of a class action complaint filed in the federal district court in michigan under the fair labor standards act by several former field sales representatives seeking overtime compensation for services rendered during their period of employment 
in march  the company participated in a required mediation session but no resolution was reached 
a decision was entered for the company at trial  but an appeal was filed 
this matter was fully resolved by settlement between the parties in june in january  the company received notice of an antitrust complaint concerning the alleged monopoly by operations of its becker cpa review corp 
subsidiary in california 
this complaint was filed in federal district court by the trustee in bankruptcy of a failed cpa review provider seeking a substantial amount of damages 
in april  this complaint was voluntarily dismissed by the plaintiff without prejudice 
the complaint was amended and subsequently re filed in state court 
an initial mediation session did not result in an agreement 
a second mediation session was held in august  resulting in a tentative agreement to settle the matter 
discovery continues and pending a final settlement  a trial is scheduled to commence in october in january  a graduate of one of devry university s los angeles area campuses filed a class action complaint on behalf of all students enrolled in the post baccalaureate degree program in information technology 
the suit alleges that the program offered by devry did not conform to the program as it was presented in the advertising and other marketing materials 
in march  the complaint was dismissed by the court with limited right to amend and re file 
the complaint was subsequently amended and re filed 
in november  three graduates of one of devry university s chicago area campuses filed a class action complaint that alleges devry graduates do not have appropriate skills for employability in the computer information systems field 
the complaint was subsequently dismissed by the court  but was amended and re filed  this time including a then current student from a second chicago area campus 
in conjunction with the required annual review procedures related to its administration of financial aid programs under the ontario student aid program  the toronto area devry campuses engaged in discussions with the ontario ministry of education relating to certain additional information requirements for the and financial aid years 
these additional information requirements could serve as the basis for a ministry claim for the return of some amounts of financial aid disbursed to students attending these campuses 
although there are no current discussions underway with the ministry  based upon its previous discussions  the company believes that there will be no significant monetary liability 
the company s toronto area campus does not accept new student admissions and is being operated under an agreement with rcc college of technology as previously discussed 
accordingly  the company is no longer participating in these financial aid programs 
the company has recorded approximately million associated with estimated loss contingencies at june  while the ultimate outcome of these contingencies is difficult to estimate at this time  the company does intend to vigorously defend itself with respect to these claims 
at this time  the company does not believe that the outcome of current claims  regulatory reviews and lawsuits will have a material effect on its cash flows  results of operations or financial position 
liquidity and capital resources the company s primary source of liquidity is the cash received from payments for student tuition  books  educational supplies and fees 
these payments include funds originating as student and family educational loans  other financial aid from various federal  state and provincial loan and grant programs  and student and family financial resources 
the pattern of cash receipts during the year is somewhat cyclical 
the level of accounts receivable from which payments are collected reaches a peak immediately after the billing of tuition  books and fees each semester 
at devry university  the principal undergraduate semesters begin in july  november and march although shorter session courses are also being offered beginning in the months of september  january and may 
collections of student receivables reach their peak during the first half of each term  generally reaching of collections for the entire term 
collections during this period exceed payments for operating expenses applicable to that period and generally provide sufficient cash flow for the balance of the semester s operations  when collections are much lower 
accounts receivable reach their lowest level just prior to the start of the next semester  dropping to their lowest point in the year at the end of june 
the end of june corresponds to both the end of the undergraduate spring semester  the end of a graduate school term and the end of a financial aid year  at which time substantially all financial aid for the previous months has been disbursed to students accounts 
ross university experiences a similar operating pattern but its semesters begin in may  september and january  smoothing somewhat the seasonal pattern at devry university 
in fiscal  the keller graduate operations of devry university had five term starts per year  but adoption of a uniform academic calendar created a revised term structure with six term starts per year that was implemented in july  effective with the start of fiscal  resulting in a somewhat different monthly pattern of cash flow this year compared to the previous year 
similarly  the professional and training segment operation has historically had two major term starts per year  but the change to an on demand cpa exam format beginning in april creates a new and somewhat smoother future cash flow pattern throughout the year than had been previously experienced 
although these term start dates and frequency may be different from the devry undergraduate operations  there are similar cyclical patterns in the billings that create accounts receivable and cash receipts within the period of these respective academic term cycles 
at june   total company accounts receivable  net of related reserves  were approximately million  compared to million last year 
increased company revenues  including revenues from ross university  created higher receivables to be collected  and there were higher average receivables from students at devry university as tuition rates were increased in both july and march  offsetting increased efforts at collection and financial aid administration 
reserves for uncollectible accounts for both undergraduate and graduate student receivables were increased as a percentage of outstanding receivables to reflect the company s current collection experience on balances owed 
to help further reduce the level of company provided interim student financing under the devry university undergraduate educardr program  students at some of the us and canadian devry undergraduate teaching locations participate in supplementary loan programs funded by private lenders 
the supplementary loans are aimed at students whose eligibility for federal and state funded financial aid is not sufficient to cover all their costs of education 
some of these loans are subject to a limited company default risk sharing agreement 
at june   the company had fully reserved for and recognized as expense the entire amount of its share of the default risk 
the company is highly dependent upon the timely receipt of financial aid funds at devry university and ross university 
the company estimates that historically  more than of its devry university undergraduate students tuition  book and fee revenues were financed by government provided financial aid to students 
keller graduate school collections from student participation in federal loan programs is approximately of keller revenues 
ross university collections from student participation in federal loan programs is approximately of its revenues 
the financial aid and assistance programs in which the company s students participate are subject to political and governmental budgetary considerations 
there is no assurance that such funding will be maintained in the future 
extensive and complex regulations in the united states and canada govern all of the government financial assistance programs in which the company s students participate 
the company s administration of these programs is periodically reviewed by various regulatory agencies 
any regulatory violation could be the basis for disciplinary action  including initiation of a suspension  limitation or termination proceeding against the company 
such program reviews may be conducted at any educational institution at any time and have been conducted in the past at several company campuses 
previous department of education and state regulatory agency program reviews have not resulted in material findings or adjustments 
in conjunction with the required annual review procedures related to its administration of financial aid programs under the ontario student aid program  the toronto area devry campuses engaged in discussions with the ontario ministry of education relating to certain additional information requirements for the and financial aid years 
these additional information requirements could serve as the basis for a ministry claim for the return of some amounts of financial aid disbursed to students attending these campuses 
although there are no current discussions underway with the ministry  based upon its previous discussions  the company believes that there will be no significant monetary liability 
the company s toronto area campus does not accept new student admissions and is being operated under an agreement with rcc college of technology as previously discussed 
accordingly  the company is no longer participating in these financial aid programs 
under the terms of the company s participation in governmental financial aid programs  certain cash received from various state governments and the us department of education is maintained in restricted bank accounts 
these funds are either received subsequent to the completion of the authorization and disbursement process for the benefit of the student or just prior to that authorization 
once the authorization and disbursement process to the student has been completed  the funds are transferred to unrestricted accounts  and these funds then become available for use by the company in current operations 
this process generally occurs within the period of the academic term for which such funds were authorized  with no academic term being more than weeks in length 
at june   cash in the amount of million was held in restricted bank accounts 
at june   cash in restricted bank accounts equaled million 
in june  the company received notice from the department of education that the equity  primary reserve and net income ratios financial responsibility ratio yielded a composite score of for the year ended june  a minimum score of is necessary to fulfill the requirements of the department s financial standards 
effective with receipt of this notice  the department required devry university to make financial aid disbursements under a cash monitoring mode 
under this cash monitoring  devry university could not submit requests for financial aid funds for its students in an amount greater than the amount of the actual disbursements made to students included in the request 
devry university has historically requested financial aid reimbursements in a fashion similar to that imposed by this restriction and  therefore  cash flow was not significantly affected 
in late july  devry university received notice from the department of education that the restriction to operate under cash monitoring had been suspended pending submission of audited financial statements for the year ending june  the company s calculation of its composite score at june is above the required minimum of cash generated from operations in fiscal was million  compared to million last year 
contributing to the increase in cash flow from operations were higher advance tuition payments and deferred tuition revenues for the coming terms  particularly at becker professional review where the change in the cpa exam format and exam schedule has resulted in a different pattern of payments and billings than under the previous twice a year exam schedule with a business cycle ending in april 
also contributing to the improved cash flow were higher non cash charges for depreciation and amortization included in net income 
partly offsetting these increases were higher accounts receivable  increasing at about the same rate as revenues 
capital expenditures in fiscal were million compared to million in the previous year 
in just the past three years  the company has invested over million for expansion  facility improvement and replacement of school laboratories  teaching and administrative equipment for its educational program offerings 
for fiscal  capital expenditures are expected to approximately equal those of fiscal there are no new large devry university campus sites under construction  but there is a further facility expansion plan at both the ross university medical and veterinary schools 
other new or expanded operating locations are expected to be in leased facilities requiring less capital spending by the company 
capital spending on improvements  including instructional technology and expansion  is an integral component of the company s operating strategy 
in may  in conjunction with its acquisition of ross university  the company terminated its million revolving loan agreement and entered into two new loan agreements 
these new loan agreements provided funding for the acquisition and for working capital needs as may be required 
under these new agreements  all borrowings and letters of credit issued under these agreements are through devry inc and global education international gei  which was a newly formed international subsidiary 
in june  the company amended this loan agreement to extend its maturity to july   reduce the interest rate on outstanding borrowings by approximately depending upon the achievement of certain financial performance ratios  and increase  at the company s option  the borrowing limit by the current loan agreements and their borrowing limits are as follows revolving credit agreement devry inc as borrower  can be increased by  at the company s option 
gei as borrower  total  senior notes devry inc as borrower  gei as borrower  total  all borrowings and letters of credit under the revolving credit facility now mature on july  at june   aggregate borrowings under these agreements totaled million  consisting of borrowings of million under the revolving credit agreement and borrowings of million under the senior notes 
based upon these levels of borrowing at fiscal year end  a increase in short term interest rates would result in million of additional annual interest expense 
at fiscal year end  letters of credit issued under the revolving credit agreement totaled approximately million 
approximately million of these letters of credit were issued in conjunction with devry university s participation in student financial aid programs 
most of the letters of credit have expiration dates of less than one year 
to date  no amount has ever been drawn under any letter of credit issued on behalf of the company 
under the terms of the revolving credit agreement  there are no required repayments until the maturity date 
there are also no required repayments under the terms of the senior note agreements until their maturity in prepayments during the first two years of the senior note agreements include a prepayment penalty 
the company does not intend to prepay any amount of the senior notes during the prepayment penalty period 
borrowings under the revolving credit agreement bear interest at either the prime rate or a eurodollar libor rate plus to  depending upon the achievement of certain financial ratios 
at june   the additional interest rate was 
borrowings under the senior note agreement bear interest at a eurodollar libor rate plus 
both agreements include financial and other covenants similar to those typically found in other loan agreements and which are not expected to hinder the company s plans for future operation 
subsequent to june   the company repaid million of its borrowings under the revolving credit agreement 
as discussed above  in june the company received notification from the department of education that the company s financial responsibility ratio yielded a composite score of for the year ended june  this notification created an event of default as defined by the revolving credit agreement that requires a minimum composite score of the composite score as calculated by the department of education was affected versus prior years by the inclusion of intangible assets from the ross university acquisition 
in june  the lenders waived this default effective june in the first quarter of fiscal  the company entered into several interest rate cap agreements to protect approximately  of its current borrowings from sharp increases in short term interest rates upon which its borrowings are based 
these interest rate cap agreements protect the portion of the company s debt that is covered by these agreements from increases in short term interest rates above 
the company intends to periodically evaluate the need for interest rate protection in light of projected changes in interest rates and borrowing levels 
the company s only long term contractual obligations consist of its revolving line of credit and senior notes  operating leases on facilities and equipment  and agreements for various services 
at june   there were no required payments under the company s borrowing agreements prior to their maturity 
required payments under non cancelable operating leases with a term in excess of one year are million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
the company is not a party to any off balance sheet financing or contingent payment arrangements  nor are there any unconsolidated subsidiaries of the company 
there are no loans extended to any officer  director or other person affiliated with the company 
the company has not entered into any synthetic leases  and there are no residual purchase or value commitments related to any facility lease 
the company has not entered into any derivative  swap  futures contract  put  call  hedge or non exchange traded contract except for the interest rate cap agreements noted above 
under the terms of these agreements  the company is not obligated to any further payment liability beyond their original purchase price 
as of the end of the fiscal year  the company had posted more than million of surety bonds to various governmental jurisdictions on behalf of devry university and becker professional review in the united states  and approximately cdn million in canada related primarily to its student recruiting and educational operations in those jurisdictions 
if the company were to fail to meet its obligations in these jurisdictions  it could be responsible for payment up to the amount of the bond issued to that jurisdiction 
to date  no surety bond has ever been paid in connection with the company failing to meet its obligations 
a summary of the company s contractual obligations is presented below dollars in thousands less than after due in total year years years years long term debt    operating leases      employment agreement   other long term obligations total cash obligations      included in the company s consolidated cash balances of million at june   is million of cash attributable to the ross university operations 
for the foreseeable future  it is the company s intention to reinvest this cash and subsequent earnings and cash flow to service outstanding debt  improve and expand facilities and operations of the schools and pursue future business opportunities outside the united states 
in accordance with this plan  cash held by ross university will not be available for general company purposes such as at devry university 
the company believes that current balances of unrestricted cash  cash generated from operations and  if necessary  the revolving loan facility will be sufficient to fund both its current operations and its current growth plans for the foreseeable future  unless future investment opportunities  similar to the acquisition of ross university  should arise 
effect of new accounting standards in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued a revision to statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 employers disclosures about pension and postretirement benefits 
the company does not have any defined benefit plans covered by this standard and there is no effect on its financial statements 
also  during fiscal  the fasb issued several staff position papers covering issues including disclosures regarding the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of and disclosures about contingently convertible securities 
the company does not have any benefit plans nor any contingently convertible securities covered by these staff position papers and there is no effect on its financial statements 
in march  the fasb issued an exposure draft on share based payment including stock options 
the company currently accounts for its stock based compensation using the intrinsic value approach of apb  and all required disclosures relative to such compensation and its pro forma effect on earnings are disclosed in the footnotes to the financial statements 
the company is evaluating the effects of the proposed new standard and believes that  upon adopting an improved method of stock option valuation as recommended by the proposed standard  the effect on its statement of income will be somewhat less than that currently disclosed as the pro forma effect on earnings in its footnotes 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no  which amends specific issues in sfas on the accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities for contracts entered into or modified subsequent to june  subsequent to june   the company entered into several interest rate cap agreements 
under the terms of these agreements  the company is not obligated to any further payment liability beyond their original purchase price 
the company believes that it has properly accounted for these instruments in accordance with the standard and included such accounting  without a material effect  in its financial statements

item a qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk the nature of the company s operations does not subject it to a concentration or dependency upon the price levels or fluctuations in pricing of any particular or group of commodities 
the financial position and results of operations of ross university s caribbean operations are measured using the us dollar as the functional currency 
almost all ross university financial transactions are denominated in the us dollar so there is no significant translation gain or loss  nor currency exposure risk associated with these operations 
the financial position and results of operations of the company s canadian subsidiary are measured using the local currency as the functional currency 
the canadian subsidiary does not have any material long term contracts to purchase or sell goods and services  other than lease agreements on its teaching facilities 
the company does not have any foreign exchange contracts or derivative financial instruments related to protection from changes in the value of the canadian dollar 
because the assets and liabilities of the company s canadian operations are small relative to those of the company  and because the canadian dollar has remained relatively stable in value compared to the us dollar  any exposure to currency change would not have a material effect on the company s results of operations or financial position 
based upon the value of the canadian subsidiary s assets at the end of the fiscal year  a decline of in the value of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar would result in a pre tax translation adjustment of less than  the interest rate on the company s debt is based upon libor interest rates for periods typically ranging from one to three months 
based upon the level of company borrowings at fiscal year end  a increase in short term interest rates would result in million of additional annual interest expense 
the company has entered into several interest rate cap agreements to protect approximately one third of its borrowings from sharp increases in short term interest rates 
however  these interest rate cap agreements do not provide protection from increases in short term interest rates until the three month libor interest rate exceeds 
at the end of august  this libor interest rate was approximately
