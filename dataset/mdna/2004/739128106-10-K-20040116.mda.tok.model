item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations market conditions throughout fiscal were challenging 
we experienced a significant reduction in demand for our products 
in our electrical power products segment  market price levels deteriorated early in the year as competition for available business volume intensified 
despite weak market conditions  we successfully increased both revenues and earnings in our process control systems business segment 
we also successfully expanded system modification and replacement equipment activity in both business segments 
with a depressed economy  we intensified our focus on working capital management 
we achieved record levels of cash flow from operating activities during as of year end  powell industries held cash  cash equivalents and marketable securites of million  an increase of million over fiscal we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of improving economic and market conditions 
in the course of operations  we are subject to certain risk factors  including but not limited to competition and competitive pressures  sensitivity to general economic and industry conditions  international political and economic risks  availability and price of raw materials and execution of business strategy  as more fully described above in our cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements  risk factors 
any forward looking statements made by or on our behalf are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of readers are cautioned that such forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties in that actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes 
results of operations year ended october  compared with year ended october  revenue and gross profit consolidated revenues decreased to million in fiscal as compared to fiscal year revenues of million 
domestic revenues decreased million to million in compared to despite weaknesses in domestic markets  new investments in oil and gas production facilities contributed to increased international revenues in fiscal revenues outside of the united states accounted for of consolidated revenues in compared to in electrical power products our electrical power products segment recorded revenues in fiscal of million compared to million in fiscal revenues from public and private utilities fell by in fiscal in particular  there was a significant decline in new investments in electrical power generation facilities 
utility revenues were million in compared to a record million in our municipal customers faced a reduced tax base with which to fund infrastructure projects in municipal and transit projects generated revenues of million compared to million in however  revenues from industrial customers totaled million in fiscal  an increase of million  or  over this increase in revenue from industrial customers resulted primarily from revenues related to the manufacture and delivery of power control modules for new oil and gas production facilities 
these long term projects to construct new oil and gas production facilities were initiated by our customers during and gross profit  as a percentage of revenues was in fiscal  compared to in fiscal year gross profit has been adversely impacted by lower production volumes and competitive pricing pressures 
partially offsetting adverse market conditions were the results of our efforts to reduced our costs of production by improving operating efficiencies through the implementation of lean initiatives 
in addition  we incurred an impairment loss of million to decrease the carrying value of machinery and equipment to their estimated market value 
this impairment loss resulted from our decision to discontinue certain product lines 
these product lines generated aggregate revenues of less than million in fiscal process control systems revenues in our process control systems segment increased to million compared to million in fiscal our most significant award during was a contract to design and build intelligent transportation systems its for the holland and lincoln tunnels from the port authority of new york and new jersey valued at million 
revenue attributable to this project totaled million during fiscal gross profit  as a percentage of revenues  was in fiscal  compared to in fiscal year for additional information related to our business segments  see note m of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
operating expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased to of revenues in fiscal compared to of revenues in fiscal year our commitment to continue to develop our customer markets and products resulted in an increase in operating expenses relative to our revenues 
research and development expenditures were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal year our research efforts are directed toward the discovery and development of new products and processes as well as improvements in existing products and processes 
interest income and expense we incurred thousand in interest expense on our term debt and outstanding industrial development revenue bonds during fiscal compared to thousand in as a result of lower levels of debt and decreased interest rates  our interest expense has declined 
interest income increased by thousand to thousand in compared to the same period of the previous year 
an increase in invested funds during has been partially offset by the lower interest rate environment 
provision for income taxes our provision for income taxes reflects an effective tax rate on earnings before income taxes of in fiscal compared to in fiscal included in our provision is million for state taxes net of federal tax benefit of which million reflects revised estimates in state tax exposures related to prior years 
over the past several years  our business has expanded and we are now conducting activities in more states 
we have accordingly increased our estimates for such state tax exposures 
going forward  we anticipate our effective tax rate to range from to cumulative effect of change in accounting principle as a result of the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we recorded a goodwill impairment loss of thousand  net of thousand taxes  as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle during the first quarter of we recorded an impairment charge of thousand  net of thousand taxes  to write off the full value of goodwill in our process control systems segment 
in our electrical power products segment  we recorded an impairment charge of thousand  net of thousand taxes 
the goodwill impairment charge accounted for a loss of per diluted share net income net income was million  or per diluted share  in fiscal year compared to million  or per diluted share in fiscal year the decrease in net income primarily relates to lower business volume and decreased gross profits in fiscal additionally  net income was negatively impacted as a result of an impairment loss of million  net of taxes  recorded to decrease the carrying value of machinery and equipment  an increase in estimates for state tax exposures related to prior years of million  net of federal tax benefits  and the net effect of a change in accounting principle related to goodwill accounted for million 
each of these adjustments to net income are discussed in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
year ended october  compared with year ended october  revenue and gross profit revenues increased to a record million in fiscal as compared to revenues in fiscal year of million 
our electrical power products segment recorded revenues in fiscal of million compared to million in fiscal during fiscal one aspect of our revenue growth was due to new worldwide investments in oil and gas production facilities 
furthermore  demand for additional electrical power generation capacities in the united states strengthened over the expansion realized in fiscal revenues in our process control systems segment were million compared to million in fiscal for additional information related to our business segments  see note m of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
international revenues increased in fiscal revenues outside of the united states accounted for of consolidated revenues in fiscal compared to in fiscal gross profit  as a percentage of revenues  improved to in fiscal  compared to in fiscal year higher production volumes  improved operating efficiencies  along with the quality of our backlog have all contributed to the improvement in gross profit 
we continued to implement lean manufacturing initiatives to reduce costs and respond to the competitive markets that we serve 
operating expenses selling  general and administrative expenses  including research and development expenditures  were million of revenues in fiscal compared to million of revenues in fiscal year the increase in operating expenses was primarily due to the growth in business volumes during the period 
research and development expenditures were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal year our research efforts were directed toward the discovery and development of new products and processes as well as improvements in existing products and processes 
interest income and expense net interest expense decreased to thousand in fiscal from thousand in fiscal due to lower levels of debt 
interest expense was related to our revolving credit facility and long term debt 
this expense was partially offset by interest income from short term investments 
provision for income taxes our provision for income taxes reflected an effective income tax rate on earnings before income taxes of in fiscal compared to in fiscal the increase in our effective tax rate was primarily a result of higher state taxes and was also partly attributable to increases in non deductible expenses 
net income net income was million  or per diluted share  in fiscal year compared to million  or per diluted share in fiscal year growth in business volume and increased gross profits resulted in earnings improvement in fiscal liquidity and capital resources we have maintained a strong liquidity position 
working capital was million at october  compared to million at october  as of october   current assets exceeded current liabilities by times and our debt to capitalization ratio was less than to at october   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million  compared to million at october  long term debt  including current maturities  totaled million at october  compared to million at october  in addition to our long term debt  we maintain a revolving credit agreement which at year end provided for a credit facility of million through february as of october   there were no borrowings under this line of credit 
for further information regarding our debt  see note f of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was million for fiscal a net reduction in operating assets and liabilities provided million with the remainder of the increase related to net earnings adjusted for depreciation  amortization and other non cash expenses 
during fiscal  operating activities provided net cash of million of which million resulted from a reduction in operating assets and liabilities 
investing activities investments in property  plant and equipment during fiscal totaled million compared to million in fiscal the majority of these expenditures were used to complete a project initiated during to increase our manufacturing capacity available for the manufacture of electrical power control modules 
these modules are provided to the oil and gas industry for use on offshore platforms 
during  we purchased million of investment grade corporate bonds 
the maturity dates of these bonds vary from five to nine years 
financing activities financing activities used million in fiscal approximately million was used for repayments on our long term debt 
other financing activities were limited to the exercise of stock options 
during fiscal  net cash used by financing activities was million  primarily from payments on long term debt 
contractual obligations at october  and  our long term contractual obligations were limited to debt and leases 
the tables below detail our commitments by type of obligation and the period that the payment will become due in thousands 
as of october  payments due by period long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations less than year  to years to years more than years  total long term contractual obligations   as of october  payments due by period long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations less than year   to years  to years  more than years   total long term contractual obligations   outlook for fiscal we expect a continued weakness and depressed price levels in the electrical power product markets we serve  and anticipate a decline in consolidated revenues of to in fiscal we expect full year revenues to range between million and million 
earnings from continuing operations are expected to range between and per diluted share 
we anticipate that our cash position will continue to grow during the first three quarters of fourth quarter working capital needs are anticipated to increase with growing levels of business activity 
we will continue to invest in our manufacturing capabilities and expect capital expenditures during fiscal year to range between million and million 
we believe that working capital  borrowing capabilities  and funds generated from operations should be sufficient to finance anticipated operational activities  capital improvements  debt repayment and possible future acquisitions for the foreseeable future 
effects of inflation and recession during each of the past three years  we have not experienced a significant effect of inflation on our operations 
we continue to evaluate the potential impact inflation could have on our business and future operations and attempt to minimize inflationary impacts by including escalation clauses in our long term contracts 
recent economic and industry reports indicate that the current conditions should remain relatively unchanged for the foreseeable future 
we do not anticipate a significant impact on operations in due to inflation 
during  we experienced a significant deterioration in business volume due to the effect of the us economy on the customers we serve 
new investments in infrastructure projects were curtailed by both our utility and industrial customers 
our municipal customers faced a reduced tax base with which to fund infrastructure projects in we anticipate these conditions will persist into critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and judgments with respect to the selection and application of accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies have the greatest impact on the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition our revenues are generated from the manufacture and delivery of custom manufactured products 
we recognize revenues under both the completed contract method and the percentage of completion method depending upon the duration and the scope of the project 
at the onset of each project  the size and duration of the contract is reviewed to determine the appropriate revenue recognition method based upon company policy 
due to the nature of the projects in the process control systems segment  all revenues are recorded using percentage of completion 
however  projects in the electrical power products segment vary widely  thus  both the completed contract and percentage of completion methods are used 
under the completed contract method  revenues are recognized upon the transfer of title  which is generally at the time of shipment or delivery depending upon the terms of the contract  when all significant contractual obligations have been satisfied  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we use shipping documents and customer acceptance  when applicable  to verify the transfer of title to the customer 
we assess whether the price is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment 
collectibility is assessed based on the creditworthiness of the customer based on credit verification and the customer s payment history 
under the percentage of completion method  revenues are recognized as work is performed based upon the ratio of labor dollars or hours incurred to date to total estimated labor dollars or hours to measure the stage of completion 
the sales and gross profit recognized in each period are adjusted prospectively for any revisions in the total estimated contract costs  total estimated labor hours to complete the project  or total contract value 
whenever revisions of estimated contract costs and contract values indicate that the contract costs will exceed estimated revenues  thus creating a loss  a provision for the total estimated loss is recorded in that period 
due to the number of estimates used in the percentage of completion calculations  conditions such as changes in job performance  job conditions  estimated contract costs and profitability may result in revisions to original assumptions  thus causing actual results to differ from original estimates 
valuation accounts the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make certain judgments and estimates regarding uncertainties 
our most significant accounting uncertainty for which a valuation account is set up is in the area of accounts receivable collectibility 
an allowance for doubtful accounts has been established to provide for estimated losses on our accounts receivable 
this estimated allowance is based on historical experience of uncollected accounts  the level of past due accounts  the overall level of outstanding accounts receivable  information about specific customers with respect to their inability to make payments and expectations of future conditions that could impact the collectibility of accounts receivable 
we continually assess our allowance for doubtful accounts and may increase or decrease our periodic provision as additional information regarding collectibility becomes available 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be fully recoverable 
for long lived assets to be held and used  the evaluation is based on impairment indicators such as the nature of the assets  the future economic benefit of the assets  any historical or future profitability measurements and other external market conditions or factors that may be present 
if such impairment indicators are present or other factors exist that indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable  we determine whether impairment has occurred through the use of an undiscounted cash flows analysis of the asset at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows exist  or quoted market prices 
if an asset is considered to be impaired  a loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
for assets held for sale or disposal  the fair value of the asset is measured using quoted market prices or an estimation of net realizable value 
assets are classified as held for sale when there is a plan for disposal and those assets meet the held for sale criteria of sfas no 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
accruals for contingent liabilities we account for contingencies in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
sfas no 
requires that we record an estimated loss from a loss contingency when information available prior to the issuance of our financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
the amounts we record for insurance claims  warranties  legal and other contingent liabilities require judgments regarding the amount of expenses that will ultimately be incurred 
we use past experience and history  as well as other specific circumstances surrounding these claims in evaluating the amount of liability that should be recorded 
actual results could differ from our estimates 
new accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
under sfas no 
 companies are required to recognize costs associated with restructurings  discontinued operations  plant closings or other exit or disposal activities in the period in which the liability is incurred rather than at the date of commitment to the plan 
we adopted sfas no 
on january  and there has been no impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
fin requires that upon issuance of a guarantee  a guarantor must recognize a liability for the fair value of the obligation assumed under the guarantee 
fin also requires additional disclosures about guarantees in the interim and annual financial statements 
the provisions of fin related to initial recognition and measurement of guarantee agreements were effective for any guarantees issued or modified after december  the adoption of these recognition and measurement provisions did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in accordance with the disclosure provisions of fin  we have included in note d of the notes to consolidated financial statements a reconciliation of the changes in our product warranty liability for the years ended october  and we provide for estimated warranty costs at the time of sale based upon historical experience rates 
our products contain warranties for parts and service for the earlier of months from the date of shipment or months from the date of initial operations 
in november  the fasb emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus opinion of eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
eitf addresses the proper accounting treatment for goods or services  or both  that are to be delivered separately in a bundled sales arrangement 
the guidance in this issue is effective for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  we adopted eitf on august  and it did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment of fasb statement no 
this statement provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change in the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation to the fair value method 
the statement also amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
under sfas no 
 annual and interim financial statements are required to have prominent disclosures about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
this statement was effective for fiscal years ending after december  this statement did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements as we have adopted only the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
the additional disclosure requirements are included in note k of these notes to consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  fin 
fin addresses the consolidation requirements of companies that have variable interest entities 
this interpretation requires the consolidation of any variable interest entities in which a company has a controlling financial interest and requires disclosure of those that are not consolidated but in which the company has a significant variable interest 
the requirements of fin will be effective for our first quarter we do not expect this interpretation to have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
 which amends and clarifies existing accounting pronouncements  addresses financial accounting and reporting for derivative or other hybrid instruments to require similar accounting treatment for contracts with comparable characteristics 
this statement was effective for contracts entered into or modified after june  and for hedging activities designated after june  this statement did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
this statement establishes standards for classifying and measuring as liabilities certain financial instruments that have characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument within its scope as a liability  or asset as appropriate  to represent obligations of the issuer 
many of the instruments covered by this statement have previously been classified as equity 
sfas no 
was effective for all financial instruments created or modified after may   and to other instruments as of september  this statement did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks arising from transactions we have entered into in the normal course of business 
these risks primarily relate to fluctuations in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and commodity prices 
we manage our exposure to changes in interest rates by optimizing the use of variable rate debt 
a increase in interest rates would result in an annual increase in interest expense of less than thousand 
in addition to variable rate debt  we also invest in marketable debt securities that are carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet  with unrealized gains and losses reported in other comprehensive income 
changes in interest rates will affect the fair value of the marketable securities as reported 
however  we believe that changes in interest rates will not have a material near term impact on our future earnings or cash flows 
during each of the past three years  we have not experienced a significant effect on our business due to changes in interest rates 
we manage our exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates primarily through arranging compensation in us dollars 
risks associated with changes in commodity prices are primarily managed through utilizing contracts with suppliers 
risks related to foreign exchange rates and commodity prices are monitored and actions could be taken to hedge these risks in the future 
we believe that fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and commodity prices will not have a material near term effect on our future earnings and cash flows 
during each of the past three years  we have not experienced a significant effect on our business due to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates or commodity prices
