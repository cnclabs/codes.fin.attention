item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes 
the following discussion includes forward looking statements  within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of  about the markets in which we operate and our business and prospects  including statements about our revenues  gross margin  operating expenses  the sufficiency of our current reserve of cash and cash equivalents  our short term investments and our bank lines of credit to meet our working capital requirements  and the effect of interest rate changes on the value of our short term investments  our bank lines of credit and our foreign currency cash balances 
these statements are subject to many risks and uncertainties which may result in different or disappointing future business and financial results 
many of these risks and uncertainties are discussed in this report  including under certain factors affecting business  operating results  and financial conditions 
results of operations for the fiscal year ended january   our net revenues increased to million from million reported for fiscal this increase in revenues was primarily attributable to the increased sales of our mpeg chipset products for advanced dvd players and ip video set top boxes  partially offset by a decline in sales of mpeg board products 
our revenues from sales of chipset products and development kits in advanced dvd players and ip video set top boxes and for the consumer appliance market increased from to of our total net revenues compared to last year  while our revenues from sales of board  chipset  and console products for the commercial streaming video market and pc add in market decreased from to of our total net revenues compared to last year 
net income for the fiscal year ended january  was million as compared to net loss of million for the prior fiscal year 
the net loss for fiscal included a charge of approximately  for impairment losses  of which  was a complete write off of the carrying amount of an investment in less than of the outstanding capital stock of a closely held technology company  and  was related to a joint venture partnership 
the following table shows certain items as a percentage of net revenues  which are included in our consolidated statement of operations fiscal fiscal fiscal net revenues cost of revenues gross margin operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative other income expense net income loss available to common shareholders net revenues the following table sets forth our net revenues in each product group  and the percentage of total net revenues represented by each product group  for the last three years dollars in thousands fiscal fiscal fiscal boards    chipsets    other    total net revenues    our board level product lines target oem customers to address the dvd upgrade market  system integrators to address the computer based training  kiosks  and corporate video on demand markets and consumer markets for upgraded multimedia products 
our chipsets are targeted toward manufacturers and large volume oem customers building interactive multimedia products for business and consumer markets 
the other category includes netstream consoles for the commercial streaming video market  dvd development kits  set top box products and accessories targeted at the consumer appliance market  service revenues under agreements for providing hardware and software support  development revenues under agreements for the customization of certain mpeg decoding chips and freight fees charged to customers 
the costs related to support service revenues and development revenues were included in sales and marketing expenses  and research and development expenses  respectively 
we anticipated the continuous decrease in revenues for our mpeg board products from fiscal through  which were mainly attributable to our decision to focus on the chipset products in the video on demand and consumer appliance market instead of board products in the commercial streaming video market and pc add in market 
the continuous and significant increases in revenues for our chipset products from fiscal through fiscal were attributable to the continuing growth of demand for our chipset products from the consumer appliance market  leading to increased unit sales and higher introduction selling prices of our new advanced dvd player and ip video set top box chipsets 
the overall increase in net revenues from other products in fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily attributable to the increased sales of dvd development kits  and development and service revenues 
the overall decrease in net revenues from other products in fiscal as compared to fiscal was mainly attributable to the decreased sales of our consoles to the commercial streaming video market 
the table below sets forth our net revenues by market  and the percentage of total net revenues represented by each market segment  for each of the last three fiscal years dollars in thousands fiscal fiscal f iscal commercial streaming video market   consumer appliance market   pc add in market   other market  total net revenues   the continuous decreases in revenues for sales of our products to the commercial streaming video market from fiscal through fiscal were mainly attributable to the conversion of board level customers in commercial applications to chip level customers  since chipsets have a substantially lower selling price per unit than boards 
we expect our revenues from the commercial streaming video market to continue to fluctuate year over year primarily due to the project oriented nature of sales of our products to our corporate streaming video market 
the continuous and significant increases in revenues for sales of our products to the consumer appliance market from fiscal through fiscal were attributable to increased sales of our mpeg chipset products to advanced dvd player and ip video set top box manufacturers 
the consumer appliance market for our products is young and rapidly evolving and we expect revenues to fluctuate in the future 
the decrease in revenues from sales of our products to the pc add in market in fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily due to lower unit sales of our mpeg xcard that was introduced in fiscal the increase in revenues from sales of our products to the pc add in market in fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily attributable to the introduction of our new mpeg xcard 
we expect our revenues from the pc add in market to be relatively insignificant in future periods as a result of our decision to focus on the consumer appliance and video on demand markets 
the category other market in the above table consists of freight charged to customers  service revenues under agreements for providing hardware and software supports  development fees under agreements relating to the development for customization of certain mpeg decoding chip technology and accessories for projects and products for various market segments 
the overall increase in net revenues from other market in fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily attributable to the increased development and service revenues 
the overall increase in net revenues from other market in fiscal as compared to fiscal was mainly attributable to the introduction of our support services and freight fees charged to customers  which has been included as revenue since the beginning of fiscal due to the uncertainty of volume of support services and development projects we are able to obtain  and the increasingly complex nature of projects which require longer development time  we expect that net revenues from other will fluctuate in the future 
the table below sets forth our net revenues by geographic region  and the percentage of total net revenues represented by each geographic region  for each of the last three fiscal years dollars in thousands fiscal fiscal fiscal asia    europe    united states    canada other regions total net revenues    our asia revenues for fiscal were derived predominantly from customers in taiwan  hong kong  china and korea 
revenues generated from taiwan  hong kong  china and korea  respectively  in fiscal accounted for   and of our total net revenues  as compared to   and for fiscal and   and for fiscal our europe revenues in fiscal were derived predominantly from customers in denmark 
revenues generated from denmark in fiscal accounted for of our total net revenues  as compared to for fiscal and for fiscal in fiscal  no customer accounted more than of our total net revenues  however  two customers based in europe and four customers based in asia accounted for of our total net revenues 
in fiscal  one customer based in europe  two customers based in the us and two customers based in asia accounted for of our total revenues  among these customers  one customer based in europe accounted for of our total net revenues 
in fiscal  three customers based in the us and one customer based in europe accounted for of our total net revenues  among these customers  three us customers represented  and  respectively 
the continuous decreases in the us revenues from fiscal through fiscal were largely attributable to the decreased sales of our board products in the corporate streaming video market and pc add in market while the continuous increases in asia and europe revenues from fiscal through fiscal were primarily attributable to the increased sales of our chipset products in the advanced dvd players and ip set top boxes and for the consumer appliance market 
our international sales have recently increased significantly  and accounted for approximately of our total net revenues in fiscal we expect that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of revenues  due in part to the significant overseas manufacturing of consumer appliances by our chipset customers 
gross margin our gross margin as a percentage of net revenues was approximately in fiscal  in fiscal  and in fiscal this improvement was due to our continuing efforts to reduce the cost of our original mpeg boards and chipsets  and the introduction and sales of our new higher margin mpeg chipset and board products and increased service and development revenues 
in addition  the costs related to service revenues and development revenues were included in sales and marketing expenses  and research and development expenses respectively  while the provisions for inventory obsolescence included in cost of revenues decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and million in fiscal we expect our gross margins will vary from period to period due to changes in the mix of product sales  selling prices  including as affected by volume discounts  our costs  the extent of development fees  and provisions for inventory obsolescence 
because average selling prices of our products typically decline over the life of a product  if we are unable to reduce costs faster than the rate of such decline or introduce new products with higher average selling prices  our gross margins will decline 
operating expenses sales and marketing expenses increased  or in fiscal compared to fiscal and  or in fiscal compared to fiscal those increases were largely due to increased headcount and expenses associated the expansion of our product marketing and sales development group 
we believe that our sales and marketing expenses will increase in absolute dollar terms in future periods as we intend to increase headcount in our sales and marketing organization and to expand our product marketing and sales development 
research and development expenses increased  or in fiscal compared to fiscal and  or in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in fiscal compared to fiscal and in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily attributable to the additions of engineering staff at our headquarters  our hong kong office and development center in france  the prototype costs of new products and licensing fees 
we plan to continue our efforts in the development of our proprietary mpeg and wmv based products  and expect research and development expenses will likely increase by to in absolute dollar terms on a year over year basis at least for the near term 
our general and administrative expenses decreased  or in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease was mainly attributable to a  recovery of bad debt expenses and the reduction of professional service fees 
our general and administrative expenses increased  or in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase was largely due to increasing costs of insurance and various professional services 
these fluctuations in general and administrative expenses in fiscal over fiscal and were largely due to the timing of expenses of various professional services 
we expect our general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollar terms in future periods due to the continually increasing cost of insurance  professional services and other expenditures associated with our business 
liquidity and capital resources as of january   our principal sources of liquidity consisted of cash and cash equivalents of million  a significant increase of million compared with million at january  this increase resulted from net proceeds of million from the issuance of  shares of our common stock in a private placement to certain institutional investors  corporate partners  and others in march  million from the issuance of  shares of our common stock in a private placement to an institutional investor in the second quarter of fiscal  million from the exercise of stock options by employees  and million generated from operating activities  which was partially offset by the repayment of capital leases of million and million of equity investments including million in an original equipment manufacturer headquartered in europe and million in a local mpeg solution provider 
we do not have guaranteed price or quantity commitments for any of suppliers and the following table sets forth the amounts in thousands of payments due under specified contractual obligations  aggregated by category of contractual obligation as of january  contractual obligations total capital operating payments due by period leases leases year or less years   years more than years total   on october   we entered into an amended and restated revolving line of credit  expiring in october  under which we can draw down a maximum of million that would be primarily collateralized by funds on deposit in accounts that would be assigned to the lender and would be included in our consolidated balance sheet as restricted cash 
such cash would not be available to fund operations 
we also have a million bank line of credit under which we had availability to draw down approximately million as of january  that line of credit will also expire in october and is primarily collateralized by our accounts receivable 
in addition  we have a second bank line of credit of million that expires in october  which line is secured by substantially all of our assets 
the entire million is available for borrowing 
as of january   we had no borrowings outstanding under any line of credit 
under the agreement and the notes for these lines of credit  we are subject to certain financial covenants 
as of january   we were in compliance with these covenants 
our primary sources of funds to date have been proceeds from preferred and common stock issuances  and borrowings under bank lines of credit 
in certain periods  cash generated from operations has also been a source of funds 
while we generated cash from operations in the twelve months ended january   it is possible that our operations will consume cash in future periods 
other than the obligations under certain contractual agreements shown on the above table  we currently have no long term debt 
based on our currently anticipated cash needs  we believe that our current reserve of cash and cash equivalents  including the proceeds from our private placements of common stock during the first half of fiscal  will be sufficient to meet our primary uses of cash  which include our anticipated working capital requirements  obligations  capital expenditures  strategic investments  and other cash needs for the next twelve months 
in addition  we believe that we will be able to comply with or make modifications to the current covenants under our existing asset based banking agreements  and to renew those lines of credit upon their expiration  in order to maintain the availability of funds under these agreements 
certain factors affecting business  operating results  and financial condition you should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing sigma 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
in such case  the trading price of our common stock could decline  and you could lose all or part of your investment 
our business is highly dependent on the expansion of young and rapidly evolving segments of the consumer electronics market the majority of our current revenues come from the sale of chipsets into emerging consumer applications  including ip video set top boxes  advanced dvd players  and high definition televisions 
we expect that the consumer digital home entertainment market will continue to account for a significant portion of our net revenues for the foreseeable future 
our ability to sustain and increase revenues is in large part dependent on the continued growth of these young and rapidly evolving segments  whose future is largely uncertain 
many factors could impede or interfere with the expansion of these consumer market segments  including general economic conditions  other competing consumer electronic products  delays in the deployment of telco video services and insufficient interest in new technology innovations 
we have a history of operating losses and we could sustain future losses 
we cannot assure you that we will be profitable and if we continue to lose money  our business may not be financially viable 
we incurred significant operating losses in fiscal     and and had negative cash flow in fiscal   and since our introduction of the realmagic mpeg product line in november  we have made significant investments in marketing and technological innovation for our realmagic products 
as a result of our investments  we experienced significant losses through fiscal fiscal  and also included significant losses associated with products other than those related to our realmagic technology 
fiscal  and included significant loss associated with a decline in demand for our realmagic products 
since our inception through january   our total accumulated deficit is  we cannot assure you that we will not incur operating losses in any future fiscal quarter or fiscal year 
our operating results are subject to significant fluctuations due to many factors and any of these factors could adversely affect our stock price 
our operating results have fluctuated in the past and may continue to fluctuate in the future due to a number of factors  including but not limited to new product introductions by us and our competitors  changes in our pricing models and product sales mix  market acceptance of the technology embodied in our products generally and our products in particular  shifts in demand for the technology embodied in our products generally and our products in particular and those of our competitors  customer acceptance of our products  gains or losses of significant customers  the timing of  and potential unexpected delays in  our customer orders and product shipments  reduction in average selling prices and gross margins  which could occur either gradually or precipitously  inventory obsolescence  write downs of accounts receivable  an interrupted or inadequate supply of semiconductor chips or other materials included in our products  for example  our source of supply for silicon wafers was  and may in the future be affected by earthquakes in taiwan  our inability to protect our intellectual property  loss of key personnel  technical problems in the development  ramp up  and manufacturing of products which could cause shipping delays  the effect of terrorist attacks and any related conflicts or similar events worldwide  availability of third party manufacturing capacity for production of certain products  the impact of a recurrence of severe acute respiratory syndrome  or sars  upon our revenues and our supply sources for our products  and the impact of potential economic instability in the asia pacific region 
sales risks and volatility of oem customer sales and resale distribution may harm our business 
our ability to increase sales and achieve continued profitability depends substantially on our ability to achieve a sustained high level of sales to our oem customers 
we have not executed volume purchase agreements with any of our current customers 
our customers are not under any obligation to purchase any minimum quantity of our products 
also  even if we achieve new design wins  we cannot assure you that these manufacturers will purchase our products in substantial volumes 
sales to any particular oem customer fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and are subject to severe price pressures by competitors 
any reductions in those sales could seriously harm our business 
based on our experience in the industry  we expect that our actual sales to oem customers will continue to experience significant fluctuations 
also  estimates of future sales to any particular customer or groups of customers are inherently uncertain 
our ability to achieve continued profitability also depends on maintaining our current sales levels of streaming video products through domestic and international distributors for resale through corporate markets 
sales to such distributors are typically subject to contractual rights of inventory rotation or price protection 
the failure of distributors to achieve sustained sell through of our products could result in product returns or delayed or uncollectable receivables 
for example  in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  we recorded sales returns from one of our distributors in the amount of approximately million which we recorded as a reduction of revenues and million which we recorded as an increase to our sales return reserve 
we also provided for a bad debt allowance in the amount of approximately million as of january  any such returns and uncollectable receivables could continue to contribute to fluctuations in our results of operations 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in obtaining or maintaining significant customers for these products 
because we depend on a limited number of major customers  the reduction  delay or cancellation of orders from these customers or the loss of these customers may adversely affect our business 
in fiscal  no customer accounted more than of our total net revenues  however  two customers based in europe and four customers based in asia accounted for of our total net revenues 
in fiscal  one customer based in europe  two customers based in the us and two customers based in asia accounted for of our total revenues  among these customers  one customer based in europe accounted for of our total net revenues 
in fiscal  three customers based in the us and one customer based in europe accounted for of our total net revenues  among these customers  three us customers represented  and  respectively 
our dependence on a few major customers will likely continue despite other changes in the composition of our customer base 
the reduction  delay or cancellations of orders from major customers or the loss of major customers could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  any difficulty in collection from key customers could harm our financial condition 
our international operations are subject to certain risks 
during fiscal   and  sales to international customers accounted for approximately   and of our total net revenues  respectively 
we anticipate that sales to international customers  including sales of realmagic products  will continue to constitute a substantial percentage of our net revenues 
also  some of the foundries that manufacture our products and components are located in asia 
due to the concentration of international sales and the manufacturing capacity in europe and asia  we are subject to the risks of conducting business internationally 
these risks include unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and fluctuations in the us dollar that could increase the sales price in local currencies of our products in international markets  or make it difficult for us to obtain price reductions from our foundries 
overseas sales and purchases to date have been denominated in us dollars 
we do not currently engage in any hedging activities to reduce our exposure to exchange rate risks 
if and when we engage in transactions in foreign currencies  our results of operations could be adversely affected by exchange rate fluctuations 
we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from sales to the asia pacific region 
this region of the world is subject to increased levels of economic instability  and this instability could seriously harm our results of operations 
further  the economic impact of a recurrence of sars or a similar event in this region could adversely affect our revenues and our business as a whole 
the timing of our customer orders and product shipments can adversely affect our operating results and stock price our quarterly revenues and operating results depend upon the volume and timing of customer orders received during a given quarter and the percentage of each order that we are able to ship and recognize as revenue during each quarter  each of which is extremely difficult to forecast 
the majority of our orders in a given quarter historically have been shipped in the last months of that quarter 
this trend is likely to continue  and any failure or delay in the closing of orders during the last part of a quarter would adversely affect our operating results  as occurred in the third quarter of fiscal further  to the extent we receive orders late in any given quarter  we may be unable to ship products to fill those orders during the same quarter in which we received the corresponding order  which would have an adverse impact on our operating results for that quarter 
our products are subject to increasing price pressures some of our markets  especially the dvd segments  are characterized by intense price competition 
the willingness of customers to design our chips in to their products depends to a significant extent  upon our ability to sell our products at competitive prices 
we expect the average selling price of our existing products to decline significantly over the life of each product as the markets of our products mature  new technologies emerge  and competition increases 
if we are unable to reduce our costs sufficiently to offset declines in product prices or are unable to introduce more advanced products with higher margins in a timely manner  we could see declines in our market share or gross margins 
if we fail to comply with or obtain waivers for covenants under our loan obligations  our financial condition could be harmed 
we have three lines of credit with a bank which allow for borrowings of million  million and million  respectively 
under the agreements for these lines of credit  which expire in october  we are subject to certain financial covenants 
since july  we have  on occasion  been in violation of some of the covenants and in all cases have obtained waivers releasing us from our obligation to meet these covenants as of previous dates 
it is possible that we may need such a waiver for future non compliance and we cannot assure you that our bank will grant these waivers 
if we do not meet these covenants and cannot obtain waivers  the lender could accelerate payments of any amounts due under the lines 
to the extent we had borrowed amounts under these lines and were required to repay them on an accelerated basis  it could substantially weaken our financial condition 
if we do not have sufficient funds available to make full payment of the lines when required  the bank could foreclose on our accounts receivable  inventories  general intangibles  equipment and tangible assets that collateralize the notes  which would harm our business 
as of january   we had no borrowings outstanding under any line of credit 
our industry is highly competitive and we cannot assure you that we will be able to effectively compete 
if we fail to compete effectively  our growth could be substantially affected 
the market for multimedia products is highly competitive and includes embedded processors provided by multiple companies 
processors have  in recent years  included increased graphics functionality 
other companies with more experience and financial resources may develop a competitive product that could inhibit future growth in sales of products utilizing our realmagic technology 
increased competition may be generated from several major computer product manufacturers that have developed products and technologies that could compete directly with realmagic products 
these competitors include analog devices  ati technologies  broadcom  cirrus logic  equator technologies  ess technology  lsi logic c cube  mediatek  phillips  stmicroelectronics  texas instruments  zoran corporation 
in addition  for some applications  video decoding is done in software operating on today s more powerful cpus 
most of our competitors have substantial experience and expertise in audio  video and multimedia technology and in producing and selling consumer products through retail distribution and oem channels 
these companies also have substantially greater engineering  marketing and financial resources than we have 
our competitors could form cooperative relationships that could present formidable competition to us 
we cannot assure you that our realmagic technology will continue to achieve commercial success or that it will compete effectively against other interactive multimedia products  services and technologies that currently exist  are under development  or may be announced by competitors 
also  we anticipate that our competitors will  over time  introduce features that have been unique to sigma designs  such as mpeg decoding  which was announced by ess technology during our third quarter of fiscal we cannot assure you that we will not lose market share or suffer price erosion in each of our market segments  as a result of the introduction of competitive products with similar features 
our future revenue growth depends in large part on the adoption of mpeg technology and new codecs 
our business strategy is  and has been  to focus on our realmagic products by investing heavily in video decoding technology and wmv we have made substantial investments in product development based on the latest mpeg technology  mpeg though mpeg has gained some market acceptance  there is increasing competition from the iso h 
standard  a next generation video codec that forms an extension of mpeg though we intend to support new codec technologies as they become commercially viable  there is no guarantee that we can successfully develop these technologies in a timely manner or that competitors will not gain market share at our expense with these new technologies 
our failure to keep pace with technological change will seriously harm our business 
our success depends  among other things  on our ability to achieve and maintain technological leadership and to remain competitive in terms of price and product performance 
our technological leadership depends on our continued technological advancements  as well as research and development investments in the area of mpeg video and audio decoding 
these advancements include the following compatibility with emerging standards and multiple platforms  improvements to our silicon architecture 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to make these advancements to our realmagic technology 
if we do make these advances  we cannot assure you that we will be able to achieve and maintain technological leadership 
any material failure by us or oems and software developers to develop or incorporate any required improvement could adversely affect the continued acceptance of our technology and the introduction and sale of future products based on our technology 
we cannot assure you that products or technologies developed by others will not render our technology and the products based on our technology obsolete 
to be competitive  we must anticipate the needs of the market and successfully develop and introduce innovative new products in a timely fashion 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully complete the design of our new products  have these products manufactured at acceptable manufacturing yields  or obtain significant purchase orders for these products 
the introduction of new products may adversely affect sales of existing products and contribute to fluctuations in operating results from quarter to quarter 
our introduction of new products also requires that we carefully manage our inventory to avoid inventory surplus and obsolescence 
our failure to do so could adversely impact our results of operations 
for example  during fiscal and  we wrote down our inventory in the amount of approximately million and million respectively  because of a continuing decline in demand for certain of our pc related products 
in addition  new products  as opposed to more mature products  typically have higher initial component costs 
these higher costs could result in downward pressures on our gross margins 
we face many risks because of our heavy reliance on certain manufacturers and suppliers that could harm our business and financial condition 
our products and components are presently manufactured entirely by outside suppliers or foundries 
we do not have long term contracts with these suppliers 
we conduct business with our suppliers on a written purchase order basis 
our reliance on independent suppliers subjects us to several risks 
these risks include the absence of adequate capacity  the unavailability of  or interruptions in access to  certain process technologies  and reduced control over delivery schedules  manufacturing yields and costs 
we obtain some of our components from a single source 
other delays or interruptions have not occurred to date  but any delay or interruption in the supply of any of the components required for the production of our realmagic silicon or our realmagic multimedia cards currently obtained from a single source  including delays resulting from a recurrence of sars  earthquakes or other business interruptions could have a material adverse impact on our sales of realmagic products  and on our business 
we must provide our suppliers with sufficient lead time to meet our forecasted manufacturing objectives 
any failure to properly forecast such quantities could materially and adversely affect our ability to produce realmagic products in sufficient quantities 
we cannot assure you that our forecasts regarding new product demand will be accurate  particularly because we sell our realmagic products on a purchase order basis 
manufacturing realmagic chipsets is a complex process  and we may experience short term difficulties in obtaining timely deliveries 
this could affect our ability to meet customer demand for our products 
any such delay in delivering products in the future could materially and adversely affect our operating results 
also  should any of our major suppliers become unable or unwilling to continue to manufacture our key components in required volumes  we will have to identify and qualify acceptable additional suppliers 
this qualification process could take up to three months or longer and additional sources of supply may not be in a position to satisfy our requirements on a timely basis 
in the past  we have experienced production delays and other difficulties  and we could experience similar problems in the future 
in addition  product defects may occur and they may escape identification at the factory 
this could result in unanticipated costs  cancellations  deferrals of purchase orders  or costly recall of products from customer sites 
loss of key personnel could cause our business to suffer 
our future success depends in large part on the continued service of our key technical  marketing  sales and management personnel 
given the complexity of realmagic technology  we are dependent on our ability to retain and motivate highly skilled engineers involved in the ongoing hardware and software development of realmagic products 
these engineers are required to refine the existing hardware system and application programming interface and to introduce enhancements in future applications 
despite incentives we provide  our current employees may not continue to work for us  and if additional personnel were required for our operations  we may not be able to obtain the services of additional personnel necessary for our growth 
we face risks related to intellectual property rights 
our ability to compete may be affected by our ability to protect our proprietary information 
we currently hold twenty eight patents covering the technology underlying the realmagic products 
we have filed certain patent applications and are in the process of preparing others 
we cannot assure you that any additional patents for which we have applied will be issued or that any issued patents will provide meaningful protection of our product innovations 
like other emerging multimedia companies  we rely primarily on trade secrets and technological know how in the conduct of our business 
we also rely  in part  on copyright law to protect our proprietary rights with respect to our realmagic technology 
we use measures such as confidentiality agreements to protect our intellectual property 
these methods of protecting our intellectual property may not be sufficient 
the electronics industry is characterized by frequent litigation regarding patent and intellectual property rights 
any such litigation could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel 
in the event of an adverse result in any such litigation  we could be required to expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology or to obtain licenses to the technology that is the subject of the litigation  and we may not be successful in such development or in obtaining such licenses on acceptable terms  if at all 
in addition  patent disputes in the electronics industry have often been settled through cross licensing arrangements 
because we do not yet have a large portfolio of issued patents  we may not be able to settle an alleged patent infringement claim through a cross licensing arrangement 
our stock price is volatile 
the market of our common stock has been subject to significant volatility  which is expected to continue 
the following factors  among others  may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock our announcement of the introduction of new products  our competitors announcements of the introduction of new products  and market conditions in the technology  entertainment and emerging growth company sectors 
the stock market has experienced  and is currently experiencing  volatility that particularly affects the market prices of equity securities of many high technology companies  such as those in the electronics industry 
this volatility is often unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of such companies 
these fluctuations  as well as general economic and market conditions  could decrease the price of our common stock 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expense during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  accounts receivable  and inventories 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition 
revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or service has been rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is probable 
we derive revenues from three principal sources product sales  product development contracts and service contracts 
revenues from product sales to oems  distributors and end users are generally recognized upon shipment  as our shipping terms are fob shipping point  except that revenues are deferred when management cannot reasonably estimate the amount of returns or where collectibility is not assured 
in those situations  revenue is recognized when collection subsequently becomes probable and returns are estimable generally upon resale by customers or sell through basis 
allowances for sales returns  price protection and warranty costs are recorded at the time that revenues are recognized 
in fiscal  we began recognizing revenue from our primary us distributor on a sell through basis 
this practice resulted from significant sales returns  which we accepted from the distributor outside of the terms of the distribution agreement 
under terms of a distribution agreement entered into with the distributor in fiscal  we granted the distributor the right of return and price protection  which allows the distributor to return any product  which is in the original packaging  for full credit up to days after the earlier of the agreement expiration or early termination 
the price protection provision allows the distributor to receive a credit for the difference between the original price and the reduced price of our products within their inventory 
although the returns are not frequent in nature  returns from this distributor cannot be reasonably estimated 
consequently  pursuant to the above policy  revenue from this distributor is recognized upon resale to the distributor s end customers 
revenues from product development agreements were recognized in fiscal and when billed  earned  and collection was assured 
in fiscal  such revenue was recognized on the percentage of completion method 
under the percentage of completion method  estimates are reviewed and revised periodically throughout the lives of the contracts 
any revisions are recorded in the accounting period in which the need for revisions becomes evident 
the company classifies all development costs related to such agreements as research and development expenses 
development revenues were   and  for fiscal  and  respectively 
revenues from service contracts consist of fees for providing engineering support services  which are recognized ratably over the contract term 
expenses related to support service revenue were included in sales and marketing expenses 
support service revenues were   and  for fiscal  and  respectively 
accounts receivable during industry downturns  certain of our customers have difficulty with their cash flows 
certain customers  typically those with whom we have long term relationships  may delay their payments by days beyond the original terms 
we review the ability of our customers to pay the indebtedness they incur with us 
we defer recognition of revenue and the related receivable when we cannot reasonably estimate whether collectibility is assured at the time products and services are delivered to our customer 
we provide an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
these estimated allowances are periodically reviewed  analyzing the customer s payment history and information regarding credit worthiness 
in fiscal  and  we recorded a provision reversal for bad debt allowance in the total amount of   and  respectively 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventories we continue to monitor our inventory levels in light of product development changes and expectations of an eventual market upturn 
we may be required to take additional charges for excess and obsolete inventories if the current industry recovery falls below our expectation or we make changes in our current product development plans 
we estimate inventory reserves for excess and obsolete inventories based on our assessments of future product sales giving consideration for factors such as the cyclical nature of our industry 
these forecasts require us to estimate our ability to see demand for current and future products and compare those estimates with our current inventory levels 
if these forecasts or estimates change adversely  or our product roadmaps change  then we would need further write down inventory 
deferred tax assets we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
recent accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  which expands upon and strengthens existing accounting guidance concerning when a company should include in its financial statements the assets  liabilities and activities of another entity 
prior to the issuance of fin  a company generally included another entity in its consolidated financial statements only if it controlled the entity through voting interests 
fin now requires a variable interest entity  as defined in fin  to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
fin also requires disclosures about variable interest entities that the company is not required to consolidate but in which it has a significant variable interest 
in october the fasb elected to defer the effective date for applying the provisions of fin for interests held by public entities in variable interest entities or potential variable interest entities until the end of the first interim or annual period ending after december  the adoption of fin is not expected to have an impact on the company s financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
this statement establishes standards for the classification and measurement of certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
this statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  the company currently has no financial instruments which meet these requirements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we face exposure to market risk from adverse movements in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  which could affect our operations and financial condition 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
interest rate sensitivity 
at january   we did not hold any short term investments 
at january   we had no borrowings outstanding under our million  million and million variable interest rate bank lines of credit  respectively 
if short term interest rates were to increase percent  the increased interest expense associated with these arrangements would not have a material impact on our net income loss and cash flows 
foreign currency exchange rate sensitivity 
the hong kong dollar and euro are the financial currencies of our subsidiaries in hong kong and france 
we do not currently enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge certain balance sheet exposures and intercompany balances against future movements in foreign exchange rates 
however  we do maintain cash balances denominated in the hong kong dollar and euro 
if foreign exchange rates were to weaken against the us dollar immediately and uniformly by percent from the exchange rate at january   the fair value of these foreign currency amounts would decline by an immaterial amount
