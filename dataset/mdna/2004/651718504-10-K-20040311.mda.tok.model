item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity and capital resources should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
operating environment and recent developments our operating results depend in large measure on oil and gas drilling activity levels in the markets we serve  as well as on the depth of drilling  which governs the revenue potential of each well 
these levels  in turn  depend on oil and gas commodities pricing  inventory levels and product demand 
rig count data is the most widely accepted indicator of drilling activity 
key average rig count data for the last five years ending december is listed in the following table us rig count newpark s primary gulf coast market newpark s primary market to total canadian rig count source baker hughes incorporated key market developments our primary gulf coast market includes south louisiana land  texas railroad commission districts and  louisiana and texas inland waters  and offshore gulf of mexico 
in addition to our primary gulf coast market  we operate in several other key markets including canada  the us central region including the us mid continent and us rocky mountain regions  west texas and areas surrounding the mediterranean sea 
unlike our primary gulf coast market  the majority of these markets experienced significant growth in as compared to revenues by key markets are as follows dollars in millions years ended december  gulf coast canada us central and west texas mediterranean other total vs 
vs 
gulf coast canada us central and west texas mediterranean nm other total nm not meaningful 
table of contents our primary gulf coast market accounted for approximately of revenues  as compared to as recently as the decline in the percentage of gulf coast revenues is the result of relatively flat gulf coast market activity during as compared to growth in most other markets 
the canadian market accounted for approximately of revenues  compared to in the increase in canadian rig activity over the prior year reflects the improving commodity gas market 
much of the terrain throughout the oil and gas producing region of canada presents soil stability and access problems similar to those encountered in the marsh areas of the us gulf coast region 
much of the drilling activity in canada has historically been conducted when winter temperatures freeze the soil and stabilize it  allowing safe access 
quarterly fluctuations in the canadian rig count generally reflect the seasonal nature of drilling activity related to these access issues 
the us central region and west texas regions accounted for approximately of revenues  compared to in revenue growth in is primarily associated with the increase in rig activity and an increase in market share 
the increase in market share is principally related to growth in the acceptance of our proprietary drilling fluids products and a reduction in the number of competitors in our liquid mud and fluids transportation business unit 
our mediterranean operations were acquired in may these operations accounted for approximately of revenues as compared to approximately in this recent acquisition provides new market opportunities in the mediterranean  eastern europe and north africa 
other market trends current short term industry forecasts suggest that we could see a slight increase in the number of rigs active in our primary gulf coast market  but this increase is expected to develop slowly as customers react to the changing risk profile of the market 
we anticipate continued market penetration of critical  deep water and geologically deeper wells with our deepdrill and flexdrill families of products  which should help to provide revenue growth as the market recovers 
current long term industry forecasts reflect a stable to growing demand for natural gas  predicated upon improving economic conditions 
in addition  current gas reserves are being depleted at a rate faster than current replacement through drilling activities 
because many shallow fields in the gulf coast market have been heavily exploited  and because of improved economics  producers are increasing drilling depth to reach the larger gas reserves 
we expect gas drilling activity to be increasingly associated with deeper  more costly wells 
we view this trend as favorable to demand for product offerings in all of our segments 
recent product developments over the last several years we have developed several new products and product enhancements in each of our business segments 
we have invested a significant amount of financial and human resources in the development of these new products 
a large portion of these investments in product developments and enhancements have been made during an extended period of market stagnation or decline  primarily in the gulf coast market 
we believe that these investments will be the prime drivers of our anticipated growth in fluids sales and engineering 
we continue to develop a niche in the drilling fluids market by expanding our customer base  drawing upon increasing acceptance of our proprietary deepdrill technology 
we have recently expanded on this technology by introducing the flexdrill system 
table of contents that draws from the technology introduced in the deepdrill system several years ago 
flexdrill allows the key components of the system to be added to the fluid as the well progresses  reducing total system cost and simplifying the fluid management process 
this product line extension has been well received  and we anticipate that  as our gulf coast customers increase their activity levels  flexdrill will become a significant part of our revenue mix in that market 
mat and integrated services 
we continue to develop the worldwide market for our dura base composite mat system 
our marketing efforts for this product continue to be focused in nine key markets  including canada  alaska and the arctic  russia  the middle east  south america  mexico  indonesia  the us military and the us utilities markets 
we now have completed sales in all of these key markets 
over the past several years of marketing this product and evaluating customer acceptance  we have gained valuable information and have begun to modify our marketing and product development strategies accordingly 
we have determined that for several of our markets  the current sales price and the long term life of the dura base mat does not correspond well with the short term nature of customer projects or the unique budgetary constraints of governmental customers 
as a result  we are pursuing more rental opportunities  particularly in markets developing in mexico  and are considering product line extensions that would be more cost competitive 
we have recently begun marketing the first production run of our new lightweight bravo mat system and believe that it will substantially broaden the opportunities in mat sales in this new mat system has been designed specifically for personnel applications by the us military  including walkways and tent flooring  but is likely to have many other applications 
e p waste disposal 
we continue to enter new markets for our environmental services as opportunities arise 
during the third quarter of we opened a disposal facility serving wyoming s jonah pinedale trend  and we have already committed to an expansion of that facility 
each geographic area has its unique challenges with respect to environmental matters  and we continue to meet these challenges by developing and applying new and innovative technologies 

table of contents results of operations summarized financial information concerning our reportable segments is shown below in the following table dollars in millions years ended december  vs

goodwill and other intangible assets fas 
fas  among other requirements  i provides that goodwill not be amortized in any circumstance  and ii requires that goodwill be tested for impairment based on a fair value concept 
we completed our fair value testing of goodwill balances during the quarter ended march  and determined that our existing goodwill balances were not impaired under the new standard 
upon adoption of fas on january   we ceased to amortize our remaining goodwill balance 
goodwill amortization was approximately million  or million net of tax  for the year ended december  effective january   we implemented a financial reporting change in our canadian operations following a change in management reporting implemented earlier in as a result of this change  the operating results for the environmental services business unit in canada will be reported as a component of the e p waste disposal segment effective january  rather than as a component of the fluids sales and engineering segment 
in addition  a portion of the operating costs of the canadian business unit will begin to be reported as a component of g a expenses effective january  in future filings  all previously reported segment data will be restated to reflect these changes 

table of contents year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues e p waste disposal total revenue for this segment consists of the following for and dollars in millions vs 
e p waste norm industrial total e p revenues increased million or  on a increase in waste volumes received 
during  we received million barrels of e p waste  compared to million barrels in the increase in waste volumes received exceeded the increase in gulf coast market rigs active during the comparable periods 
we believe this is an indication of the impact of the new discharge limitations on synthetic based fluids that became fully effective in august the average revenue per barrel declined  to  as compared to an average of in  as a result of changes in the mix of waste streams received 
norm revenues declined in due to a decline in event driven projects 
based on new bid activity  we believe that the volume of waste received for remediation projects will increase in as a result of recent court decisions in landowner litigation 
in addition  we continue to believe that the trend towards deeper drilling  particularly in our primary gulf coast market  should result in increased volumes of e p waste receipts for  even if rig activity in this market does not increase 
as noted above  effective january   we implemented a management reporting change in our canadian operations 
as a result of this change  the operating results for the environmental services business unit in canada will be reported as a component of the e p waste disposal segment effective january  rather than as a component of the fluids sales and engineering segment 
the canadian business unit operations included results for the newly opened facilities in the jonah pinedale field discussed below 
total revenues for the canadian environmental services business unit were million in and million in fluids sales and engineering total revenue by region for this segment was as follows for and dollars in millions vs 
gulf coast canada us central and west texas total north american mediterranean total the average number of rigs we serviced in the north american market increased by  from in to in average revenue per rig in the north american market remained relatively flat at approximately million 
the operations serving the mediterranean market were acquired effective may  
table of contents activity in our primary gulf coast market did not recover in as in other north american markets 
after a slow in the gulf coast  we believe that our customer base in that market is showing signs of increased activity 
as of january   we have over customers for whom we are preferred providers or have annual contracts in place 
we believe their choice of newpark is driven in large part by acceptance of our proprietary high performance water based fluid technology 
during  we successfully provided these fluids to over customers and wells 
an early indicator of that progress was reflected in record december revenue levels that have been sustained thus far in  although we suspect that this trend will be unpredictable in its early stages 
revenues in the canadian market increased on a increase in average rigs active in the canadian market 
we serviced an average of rigs in the canadian market in  as compared to in  an increase of 
revenues in the us central and west texas regions increased 
we serviced an average of rigs in these regions in  as compared to in  an increase of 
the significant difference between the increase in revenues and the increase in the number of rigs serviced in these markets reflects the increase in the depth of wells serviced 
during the second half of  we opened a new liquid waste disposal facility to serve the jonah pinedale field in wyoming  a very active north american natural gas trend 
as currently configured  the jonah pinedale facility could add million in annual revenue in we are currently working on applying a new technology that would boost the effective capacity of the facility and open the door to on site processing in the field 
we believe this would improve revenue and earnings by eliminating transportation cost and strengthening our competitive position in that market 
the results for this facility  along with the results for the canadian environmental business unit  will be reclassified to the e p waste disposal segment beginning january  mat and integrated services total revenue for this segment consists of the following for and dollars in millions vs 
installation re rental total gulf coast mat rental integrated services and other canadian operations composite mats total average rental pricing for the mat rental market increased to per square foot in from per square foot in  an increase of 
the highly competitive pricing in this market experienced in and began to subside in the fourth quarter as a result of lower mat inventories of all industry participants 
the volume of mat installations increased to million square feet in as compared to million square feet in  an increase of 
re rental income ie  revenues related to our customer s extension of agreements beyond the initial contractual period increased due to the continued trend to longer duration installations resulting from increased well depth 
we expect the gulf coast mat rental market to show stronger results in as the industry s inventory of rental mats continues to decline to new historic lows 
already in we have begun to see an increase in pricing on new projects  without a corresponding increase in industry activity  primarily as a result of the decline in industry capacity 
integrated services and other revenues  our lowest margin business unit for this segment  includes a comprehensive range of environmental services necessary for our customers oil and gas exploration and production activities 
these revenues also include the operations of our sawmill in 
table of contents batson  texas 
the increase in revenues is principally associated with an increase in revenues at our sawmill 
the operations of our sawmill are approximately break even 
the principal reason for the increase in canadian revenue was the sale of the majority of the wooden mat rental inventory in without significant margin contribution 
these sales  which totaled million  were made in keeping with the strategic shift to become a seller of both wood and composite mats to regional service companies in the geographically diverse canadian market 
during  we sold approximately  composite mats  resulting in million in revenues  as compared to million of revenue on approximately  mats sold in during the past three years  we have sold over  mats into nine targeted markets worldwide 
some of these markets will remain sales markets  while others will become rental markets over time 
based on market data gathered in  we believe there is a significant rental opportunity in support of expanding exploration and development activity in mexico 
as a result  we plan on opening a new business unit in that country in the first quarter 
we will be the majority owner of the business with the mexican principals who are assisting us in development of the market holding a minority stake 
operating income e p waste disposal operating income for this segment increased million  or  on a million  or  increase in revenues 
the significant increase in operating margin as compared to the increase in revenues is principally due to cost reduction measures implemented beginning in late and completed by june  the cost reductions included  among other things  our decision not to exercise our option to renew a disposal agreement with us liquids beyond the june  expiration date 
with the termination of this agreement and completion of other cost reduction measures  operating margins for this segment improved significantly beginning in the third quarter of as previously noted  effective january   we implemented a financial reporting change in our canadian operations following a change in management reporting implemented earlier in as a result of this change  the operating results for the environmental services business unit in canada will be reported as a component of the e p waste disposal segment effective january  rather than as a component of the fluids sales and engineering segment 
the canadian business unit operations included results for the newly opened facilities in the jonah pinedale field discussed above 
total operating income for the canadian environmental services business unit were million in and  in fluids sales and engineering operating income from fluids sales and engineering increased  or  in as compared to operating margins for this segment declined from in to in the decline in operating margin principally reflects the decline in gulf coast revenues and the resulting operating loss for this business unit and continued market development costs in that added new customers for in addition  the operating margin declined as a result of an increase in lower margin revenue from the mediterranean and north african markets associated with the acquisition of ava 
the effects of the operating loss for the gulf coast business unit and the lower operating margin in our mediterranean operations were not fully offset by operating profit increases in the other drilling fluids business units 
we anticipate activity in the gulf of mexico market will increase in this market represents the premium priced business for this segment 
we expect to see margin improvement throughout as we continue to penetrate the offshore gulf of mexico market and gain wider customer acceptance of our higher margin premium products  such as our deepdrill and flexdrill family of products 
mat and integrated services segment operating contribution declined by million to  for the year 
this decline in operating income in spite of the increase in revenues is due to 
table of contents higher marketing and operating costs  principally associated with composite mats  and changes in the mix of revenues in as compared to declines in composite mat sales revenue were offset by increases in sales of wooden mats from our rental inventory in canada and an increase in integrated services revenues with insignificant operating margin contribution 
the keys to improvement in operating results for this segment in are anticipated to be increases in composite mat sales and rentals  the continued increase in utilization and  as a result  better pricing for our gulf coast inventory due to the decline in industry capacity  and increased non oilfield projects which generate higher margins than our oilfield projects 
provision for uncollectible accounts the provision for uncollectible accounts was recorded in the fourth quarter of and relates principally to changes in our evaluation of the collectibility of two receivable balances from customers that are in bankruptcy proceedings  and was based upon adverse developments in those proceedings 
these customer balances were included in the assets of the fluids sales and engineering segment 
impairment of long lived assets the charge for impairment of long lived assets was recorded in the fourth quarter and relates to our evaluation of the net realizable value of assets at our old barite grinding facilities in channelview  texas that will either be abandoned or sold when the relocation of these facilities is completed in the underlying assets were included in the assets of the fluids sales and engineering segment 
foreign currency exchange gains net foreign currency gains were  in as compared to  in the principal components of this increase were realized and unrealized gains on short term intercompany payable balances of our canadian operations due to the significant decline in the us dollar against the canadian dollar in interest income and interest expense net interest expense was million for  an increase of million  or  as compared to million for the increase in net interest cost is principally due to the absence in of the million benefit recorded in from an interest rate swap arrangement settled on july  interest expense was also higher in compared to the prior year due to an increase of million in average outstanding borrowings  principally associated with a temporary year end draw of million to secure a letter of credit arrangement as further discussed in liquidity and capital resources 
the increase in the average outstanding borrowings was partially offset by a decline in the average effective interest rate from in to in  exclusive of the effect of the swap 
the decrease in the effective interest rate resulted from the general decline in interest rates experienced during and  which were offset in part by higher pricing spreads on our credit facility due to lower earnings and the corresponding reduction in our debt coverage ratios 
provision for income taxes we recorded income tax expense of million in and million in this equates to of pre tax income in and of pre tax income in the higher effective tax rate in results principally from the higher mix of foreign income to total consolidated income and from the level of non deductible business expenses in relation to low pretax income 

table of contents year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues e p waste disposal total revenue for this segment consists of the following for and dollars in millions vs 
e p waste norm industrial total e p waste disposal revenue declined million  or  on a decline in waste volumes received 
during  we received million barrels of e p waste  compared to million barrels in this decline in waste volumes received is due primarily to the decline in average rigs 
the average revenue per barrel increased to in  as compared to an average of in  as a result of favorable changes in the mix of waste streams received  with an increasing proportion of the waste coming from the offshore market in response to regulatory changes 
results for the second half of were impacted by adverse tropical weather 
in spite of these weather effects  the decline in receipts during the second half of as compared to the comparable period in was only  significantly less than the decline in active rigs in our primary market during this period 
this was principally due to the impact of the new discharge limitations on synthetic based fluids that had recently became fully effective 
in the third quarter of we opened a new facility at galveston  texas that immediately began to receive waste from customers in that area 
norm revenues declined in due to a decline in event driven projects 
fluids sales and engineering total revenue by region for this segment was as follows for and dollars in millions vs 
gulf coast canada us central and west texas total north american mediterranean nm total nm not meaningful the average number of rigs we serviced in the north american market declined by  from in to in the revenue decline was less than the decline in the number of rigs serviced  as we continued to benefit from our focus on deeper drilling projects in key markets 
as a result of this trend  the average annual revenue per rig increased to approximately million in  as compared to approximately million in the increased revenue generation per rig is due principally to increasing market participation in the us gulf of mexico market  and the improving quality depth of drilling and difficulty of drilling of work assigned to us by our customers 

table of contents in may  we acquired of the outstanding capital stock of ava  spa  a year old company that provides drilling fluids and related products to exploration companies in the mediterranean region  eastern europe and north africa 
results of operations for ava subsequent to the effective date of the acquisition provided million in revenues during mat and integrated services total revenue for this segment consists of the following for and dollars in millions vs 
installation re rental total gulf coast mat rental integrated services and other canadian operations composite mats total pricing of mats rented in the core gulf coast market declined substantially compared to a year ago due to reduced drilling activity in this market during  while installation volume remained flat at million square feet 
average rental pricing for this market declined to per square foot in from per square foot in  a decline of 
the volume of re rentals declined during  as compared to  also as a result of reduced activity 
the highly competitive pricing in the gulf coast mat rental market experienced in began to subside in the fourth quarter as a result of increased activity and lower mat inventories 
during  we sold approximately  composite mats  resulting in million in revenues  as compared to million of revenue on approximately  mats sold in the decline in canadian wooden mat rental revenues was principally related to the significant decline in canadian rig activity and the effects of our customers utilization of composite mats sold in operating income e p waste disposal operating income for this segment declined million on a million decline in revenues 
as noted previously  in late  we began to reduce costs in this segment  principally associated with our us liquids contract  in response to reduced market activities 
these cost reductions were fully in place by june  and were slightly offset by the costs associated with opening our new galveston facility and expanding two key service facilities 
with completion of our cost reduction strategy and the termination of the usl agreement  operating margins for this segment improved significantly beginning in the third quarter of fluids sales and engineering operating income from fluids sales and engineering declined million  or  in as compared to operating margins for this segment declined from in to in this decline in operating income and operating margin is due in part to lower revenues in  our internal operating leverage and the mix of product sales 
the operating leverage of this segment was impacted in by our decision to increase our technical staffing during the downturn 
this decision was made in anticipation of an improving market and expansion of our customer base 
as a result of this decision  along with the ava acquisition  operating costs for this segment increased during  in spite of the decline in revenues 

table of contents the gross margin for this segment was in  as compared to in revenues in reflected an increase in sales of our higher margin proprietary products  including our deepdrill family of products 
the increase in percentage of these higher margin product revenues was partially offset by an increase in lower margin revenue from the mediterranean and north african markets associated with the acquisition of ava 
mat and integrated services mat and integrated services operating income declined million in as compared to  on a million decline in revenues 
the large decline in operating income is primarily due to two factors 
first  we experienced lower rental income in our primary oilfield rental business due to a reduction in pricing from to per square foot installed and a significant reduction in re rental income of million  or 
second  we experienced lower composite mat sales in composite mat sales generated a gross margin contribution of approximately in in december  we converted approximately million of remaining obligations under operating leases for certain equipment to a capital lease 
this conversion was made to reduce operating costs  reduce the interest rates charged and extend the payment terms 
this conversion reduced operating costs in by approximately million and helped to partially offset the effects of the revenue declines noted above 
interest income and interest expense net interest expense was million for  a decrease of million  or  as compared to million for the decrease in net interest cost is principally due to the interest rate swap arrangement entered into in november and settled on july  the total benefit from this arrangement  recognized entirely in  was million 
in addition to the swap arrangement  interest expense was lower in compared to the prior year due to a decrease of million in average outstanding borrowings and a decline in the average effective interest rate from in to in  exclusive of the effect of the swap 
the decrease in the effective interest rate resulted from the general decline in interest rates experienced during and  which were partially offset by higher pricing spreads on our credit facility due to lower earnings and the corresponding reduction in our debt coverage ratios 
provision for income taxes we recorded income tax expense of million in and million in this equates to of pre tax income in and of pre tax income in the higher effective tax rate in results from certain non deductible business expenses in relation to low pretax income 
liquidity and capital resources our working capital position was as follows as of december working capital s current ratio during the year ended december   our working capital position increased by million 
this increase in working capital was principally due to the temporary effect of million in restricted cash at december  used to secure a letter of credit obligation and increases in drilling fluids raw materials inventory  principally barite 
in january  we acquired the entire raw barite inventory  which had previously been held on a consignment basis 
this change from a consignment basis resulted in an increase in inventory of approximately million in 
table of contents during  we reduced our purchase of composite mats to approximately  units 
the manufacturing facility loma is currently not producing any mats due to low demand  and we have reduced the number of planned purchases of composite mats in to approximately  units  equal to the remaining inventory held by loma 
purchases in will be based on loma s cash flow requirements until its inventory on hand is exhausted 
with this decline in purchases  along with anticipated composite mat sales in  we expect to reduce the level of composite mat inventory by the end of net trade accounts receivable increased million during on a million increase in revenues 
during  days sales in receivable declined by days  from days in to days in we continue to monitor our accounts receivable positions and anticipate a further reduction in our collection cycles in  although not as significant as the reduction experienced in we anticipate that our working capital requirements for will increase as a result of the expected improvement in revenue  related principally to expected market penetration and to modest gains in rig activity 
some of this expected increase in working capital requirements should be offset by our continued focus on improving our collection cycle and anticipated reductions in composite mat inventory 
if market conditions improve in as anticipated  we will likely have to supplement our operating cash flows with borrowings under our credit facility to fund the resulting increase in working capital 
we believe we have adequate capacity under our revised credit facility to meet these anticipated working capital needs 
cash generated from operations during totaled million  excluding the effects of the million restricted cash investment discussed below 
this cash was supplemented by net borrowing on our line of credit arrangements to principally fund net capital expenditures of million 
net capital expenditures in were slightly above depreciation amounts and we anticipate that capital expenditures will be below depreciation 
we have less than million in commitments associated with capital projects for  principally associated with expansion of our environmental operations in the jonah pinedale market 
the remaining amounts of capital improvements are expected to be used principally to expand drilling fluids and environmental service capacity in growing markets as and when needed 
our commitments to expand drilling fluids and environmental capacity will be monitored and adjusted depending on market conditions  our operating cash flows and other available cash resources 
we expect to fund capital expenditures with cash generated from operations 
our long term capitalization was as follows as of december long term debt excluding current maturities credit facility senior subordinated notes other total long term debt stockholders equity total capitalization long term debt to long term capitalization on february  our bank credit facility the credit facility was amended and restated whereby the form of the facility was converted into an asset based lending facility the new credit facility 
under the new credit facility  we can borrow up to million in the form of million in term debt and million in revolving debt 
availability under the revolving portion of the new credit facility is based on a percentage of our eligible consolidated accounts receivable and inventory as defined in the new credit facility 
the new credit facility bears interest at either a 
table of contents specified prime rate or the libor rate  plus a spread determined quarterly based upon a fixed charge coverage ratio 
the new credit facility is secured by a pledge of substantially all of our domestic assets 
the new credit facility contains a fixed charge coverage ratio covenant and a tangible net worth covenant 
in addition  the new credit facility includes a requirement that we maintain a minimum excess availability of million from may  to june  as a result of the conversion of the credit facility to the new credit facility we anticipate approximately a one percent reduction in the effective cost of outstanding borrowings 
in addition  the number of financial covenants was significantly reduced in the new credit facility 
due to consistently low operating results in  financial covenants under the credit facility were modified on numerous occasions  resulting in additional fees 
we believe that the structure of the new credit facility provides a better source of capital given our current operating environment 
ava maintains its own credit arrangements  consisting primarily of lines of credit with several banks  with the lines renewed on an annual basis 
advances under these credit arrangements are typically based on a percentage of ava s accounts receivable or firm contracts with certain customers 
as of december   ava had a total of million outstanding under these facilities 
we do not provide a corporate guaranty of ava s debt 
with respect to off balance sheet liabilities  we lease most of our office and warehouse space  rolling stock and certain pieces of operating equipment under operating leases 
we have issued a guaranty of certain debt obligations of the manufacturer of our composite mats loma 
this guaranty is backed by a letter of credit 
the amount of this guaranty as of december  was million 
in december  we temporarily secured this letter of credit with a certificate of deposit while we negotiated an extension of the credit facility  drawing million under the credit facility for that purpose 
with the closing of the new credit facility  the obligation to secure this guarantee terminated  and in early march we will cash the certificate of deposit  which was reported as restricted cash in our balance sheet at december   and pay down the new credit facility with the proceeds 
the underlying debt obligation of loma matures in approximately five years 
the loma plant suspended production in may and has not resumed operations 
the ability of loma to continue to repay its debt obligations is dependent upon sales of composite mats 
we have agreed to purchase from loma the mats remaining in its inventory at december  during should an increase in composite mat sales not occur  loma would not restart production and our guarantee may be called upon to fulfill loma s debt obligation 
since our guarantee is secured by a letter of credit  there would not be any impact on the availability under our new credit facility should performance under the guarantee be required 
we have also issued a guaranty for certain debt obligations of a joint venture moctx  which supplies a portion of our wooden mats on a day rate leasing basis 
the amount of this guaranty as of december  was million 
except as described in the preceding paragraphs  we are not aware of any material expenditures  significant balloon payments or other payments on long term obligations or any other demands or commitments  including off balance sheet items to be incurred within the next months 
inflation has not materially impacted our revenues or income 

table of contents a summary of our outstanding contractual and other obligations and commitments at december  is as follows in millions payments due by period less than after total year years years years long term debt and capital leases operating leases trade accounts payable and accrued liabilities reflected in balance sheet under gaap purchase commitments  not accrued other long term liabilities reflected in balance sheet under gaap performance bond obligations secured guarantees standby letter of credit commitments not included elsewhere total contractual obligations includes commitments under an operating lease with moctx 
this future commitment is also guaranteed as described elsewhere in this report 
includes purchase order commitments for inventory including million secured by standby letters of credit or equipment not received as of december  also includes commitments under construction contracts as of december  we anticipate that the obligations and commitments listed above that are due in less than one year will be paid from operating cash flows 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles  which requires us to make assumptions  estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported 
we periodically evaluate our estimates and judgments related to uncollectible accounts and notes receivable  inventory  customer returns  impairments of long lived assets  including goodwill and other intangibles and our valuation allowance for deferred tax assets 
note a to the consolidated financial statements contains the accounting policies governing each of these matters 
our estimates are based on historical experience and on our future expectations that are believed to be reasonable 
the combination of these factors forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from our current estimates and those differences may be material 
we believe the critical accounting policies described below affect our more significant judgements and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition for the fluids sales and engineering segment  revenues are recognized for sales of drilling fluid materials upon shipment of the materials  less an allowance for product returns 
engineering and related services are provided to customers at agreed upon hourly or daily rates and are recognized when the services are performed 
the reserve for estimated product returns is based on our historical experience of the percentage of returns  which in turn is based on the size and type of 
table of contents rig serviced and the nature of the products consumed by the customer 
these percentages are periodically reviewed and updated and are applied to our drilling fluids product sales to determine the required reserve 
revisions to the return reserve are charged or credited to income in the period in which they occur 
for the e p waste disposal segment  revenues are recognized when we take title to the waste  which is upon its receipt 
for the mat and integrated services segment  revenues are recognized on both fixed price and unit priced contracts  which are short term in duration  on the percentage of completion method as measured using specific units delivered or project milestones completed 
this method is used because we believe it reflects the level of effort expended by us in proportion to the total effort required to complete the contract 
revenues for services provided to customers at agreed upon hourly or daily rates are recognized when the services are performed 
revenues for sales of composite mats are recognized when title passes to the customer 
for revenues recognized on the percentage of completion basis  provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which these losses are determined 
changes in job performance  job conditions and estimated profitability may result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 
profit incentives are included in revenues when their realization is reasonably assured 
an amount equal to contract costs attributable to claims is included in revenues when realization is probable and the amount can be reliably estimated 
allowance for doubtful accounts reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable and notes receivable are determined on a specific identification basis when we believe that the required payment of specific amounts owed to us is not probable 
for notes receivable  our judgments with respect to collectibility includes evaluating any underlying collateral 
the majority of our revenues are from mid sized and international oil companies and government owned or government controlled oil companies  and we have receivables in several foreign jurisdictions 
changes in oil and gas drilling activity or changes in economic conditions in foreign jurisdictions could cause our customers to be unable to repay these receivables  resulting in additional allowances 
since amounts due from individual customers can be significant  future adjustments to the allowance can be material 
inventory reserves for inventory obsolescence are determined based on our historical usage of inventory on hand as well as our future expectations related to our customers needs  market conditions and the development of new products 
we have recently developed several new products  including our deepdrill family of products and our dura base composite plastic mat system 
our inability to obtain market acceptance of these products  changes in oil and gas drilling activity and the development of new technologies associated with the drilling industry could require additional allowances to reduce the value of inventory to the lower of its cost or net realizable value 
asset impairments we perform goodwill and intangible asset impairment tests on at least an annual basis in accordance with the guidance in statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets fas 
we perform long lived asset impairment tests in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets fas 
in accordance with fas  impairments are calculated based on a fair value concept 
in accordance with fas  impairments are calculated based on a future cash flow concept 

table of contents we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors considered important  which could trigger an impairment review  include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant changes in the market value of assets  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period and in our market capitalization relative to our net book value 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill may not be recoverable based on one or more of the above indicators  any impairment is calculated in accordance with fas and fas and recorded as an impairment loss 
in  statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  became effective and  as a result  we ceased to amortize our goodwill 
in lieu of amortization  we are required to perform an annual impairment review of goodwill 
income taxes we have net deferred tax assets of million at december  we provide for deferred taxes in accordance with fas  accounting for income taxes 
under fas  a valuation allowance must be established to offset a deferred tax asset if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
at december   we had recorded a valuation allowance for all state nols 
we have considered future taxable income and tax planning strategies in assessing the need for our valuation allowance 
should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period this determination was made 
new accounting standards in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards fas  business combinations  and fas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
we adopted these standards on january   which among other requirements  i prohibit the use of the pooling of interests method of accounting for business combinations  ii create more specific criteria for identifying other intangible assets which are acquired in a business combination  iii provide that goodwill not be amortized in any circumstance  and iv require that goodwill be tested for impairment annually or when events or circumstances occurring between annual tests indicate that goodwill for a reporting unit might be impaired 
fas established a new method for testing goodwill for impairment based on a fair value concept 
we completed our fair value testing of goodwill balances during the quarter ended march  and determined that our existing goodwill balances were not impaired under the new standards 
upon adoption of the standards on january   we ceased to amortize our remaining goodwill balance 
goodwill amortization was approximately million for the year ended december  in june  the fasb issued fas  accounting for asset retirement obligations  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  fas requires legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets to be recognized at their fair value at the time that the obligations are incurred 
upon initial recognition of a liability  that cost should be 
table of contents capitalized as part of the related long lived asset and allocated to expense over the useful life of the asset 
our principal retirement obligations consist of expected costs of site restoration and other cleanup costs at leased facilities for all of our business units  and costs to plug and abandon wells at our disposal facilities owned or leased by our e p waste disposal segment 
we anticipate that the majority of the costs related to asset retirement obligations will be incurred between the years and based on our current business plans  no material expenditures for asset retirement obligations are expected prior to we adopted fas on january   at which time a liability of  was recorded as a component of other non current liabilities  representing the fair value of the expected future liability for asset retirement obligations at the date of adoption 
in addition  upon adoption  net assets of  were recorded  reflecting the unamortized value of the net assets that would have been recorded at the time the obligations originated  less accumulated depreciation from that date to the date of adoption 
the gross difference between the net liability and net assets as of the date of adoption was  and has been recorded as a component of operating expenses 
this amount was considered immaterial and was not disclosed as a cumulative effect of accounting change 
in january  the fasb issued financial interpretation number fin consolidation of variable interest entities  which clarifies the application of accounting research bulletin  consolidated financial statements  to certain entities called variable interest entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
the disclosure requirements of fin were effective for all financial statements issued after january  the consolidation requirements apply to all variable interest entities created after january  in addition  public companies must apply the consolidation requirements to variable interest entities that existed prior to february  and remain in existence as of the beginning of annual or interim periods beginning after march  we are currently assessing the impact of fin on the reporting for our two variable interest entities 
these variable interest entities consist of the interest in loma and in moctx 
these variable interest entities are currently accounted for under the equity method and are not consolidated in our financial statements 
it is possible that we could conclude  after completion of our assessment  that one or both of these entities would need to be consolidated in our financial statements 
if this were to occur  the assets and the liabilities of the variable interest entity and the operating results of that entity would be consolidated into our financial statements 
in addition  the recorded investments in these entities  representing our interest in the equity of the entities  would be eliminated in consolidation and a minority interest  representing the uncontrolled interest  would be recorded 
if these entities were consolidated  the impact would not be considered material to our results of operations  since all of the operating activity of these variable interest entities is with newpark or one of our wholly owned subsidiaries and this activity would be eliminated in consolidation 

table of contents the unaudited assets and liabilities of loma that would be consolidated with our balance sheet  after consideration of elimination entries  at december  are as follows cash inventory other current assets total current assets property  plant equipment  net intangible assets  net other non current assets total assets current portion of long term debt other current liabilities total current liabilities long term debt total liabilities net assets  after consideration of eliminations in may  the fasb issued fas accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
fas requires that certain financial instruments issued in the form of shares that are mandatorily redeemable  as well as certain other financial instruments  be classified as liabilities in the financial statements 
fas is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may  and otherwise was effective beginning with our third quarter of the provisions of this statement did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks that are inherent in our financial instruments arising from transactions that are entered into in the normal course of business 
historically  we have not entered into derivative financial instrument transactions to manage or reduce market risk or for speculative purposes 
however  in november  we did enter into an interest rate swap arrangement 
a discussion of our primary market risk exposure in financial instruments is presented below 
long term debt we are subject to interest rate risk on our long term fixed interest rate senior subordinated notes 
our credit facility has a variable interest rate and  accordingly  is not subject to interest rate risk 
all other things being equal  the fair market value of debt with a fixed interest rate will increase as interest rates fall 
conversely  the fair market value of this debt will decrease as interest rates rise 
our policy has historically been to manage exposure to interest rate fluctuations by using a combination of fixed and variable rate debt 
in november  we entered into an interest rate swap instrument  which effectively converted our senior subordinated notes to a floating rate for a two year period ending in december on july   we terminated the swap instrument and received a payment of  the total benefit recognized under the swap instrument as a reduction to interest expense  including the termination fee  was million for the year ended december  our senior subordinated notes mature on december  there are no scheduled principal payments under the notes prior to the maturity date 
however  all or some of the notes 
table of contents may be redeemed at a premium after december  we have no current plans to repay the notes ahead of their scheduled maturity 
foreign currency our principal foreign operations are conducted in canada and  since the acquisition of ava in  in areas surrounding the mediterranean sea 
there is exposure to future earnings due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates when transactions are denominated in currencies other than our functional currencies 
we primarily conduct our business in the functional currency of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
historically  we have not used off balance sheet financial hedging instruments to manage foreign currency risks when we enter into a transaction denominated in a currency other than our local currencies because the dollar amount of these transactions has not warranted our using hedging instruments

in light of these risks  uncertainties and assumptions  the forward looking events discussed in this report might not occur 
among the risks and uncertainties that could cause future events and results to differ materially from those anticipated by us in the forward looking statements included in this report are the following a material decline in the level of oil and gas exploration and production and any reduction in the industry s willingness to spend capital on environmental and oilfield services could adversely affect the demand for our services  material changes in oil and gas prices  expectations about future prices  the cost of exploring for  producing and delivering oil and gas  the discovery rate of new oil and gas reserves and the ability of oil and gas companies to raise capital could adversely affect the demand for our services  changes in domestic and international political  military  regulatory and economic conditions may adversely affect the demand for oil and gas or production volumes  a rescission or relaxation of government regulations affecting e p and norm waste disposal could reduce the demand for our services and reduce our revenues and income 
changes in existing regulations could require us to change the way we do business  which may have a material adverse affect on our consolidated financial statements  our patents or other proprietary technology may not prevent our competitors from developing substantially similar technology  which would reduce any competitive advantages we may have from these patents and proprietary technology  we may not be able to keep pace with the continual and rapid technological developments that characterize the market for our products and services  and our failure to do so may result in our loss of market share  
table of contents we face intense competition in our existing markets and expect to face tough competition in any markets into which we seek to expand  which will put pressure on our ability to maintain our current market share and may limit our ability to expand our market share or enter into new markets  we may not be able to successfully integrate our recent acquisitions  including ava  into our operations  and these acquisitions may not achieve sales and profitability levels that justify our investment in them  which could result in these businesses placing downward pressure on our margins or our disposing of these businesses at a loss  the demand for our services may be adversely affected by shortages of critical supplies or equipment in the oil and gas industry and personnel trained to operate this equipment  we may not be able to successfully replace our wooden mat fleet with our new composite mats or introduce our other new products and services  including our deepdrill technology and our new dura base sp mat  and we may not be successful in gaining acceptance or market share for these products and services  we may not be able to maintain the necessary permits to operate our non hazardous waste disposal wells or we may not be able to successfully compete in this market  adverse weather conditions could disrupt drilling operations and reduce the demand for our services  we would be adversely affected if there were any delays in implementing the new synthetic fluids disposal regulations or if these regulations failed to materially impact waste disposal volumes or drilling fluids revenues  we may fail to comply with any of the numerous federal  state and local laws  regulations and policies that govern environmental protection  zoning and other matters applicable to our business  or these regulations and policies may change  and we may face fines or other penalties if we fail to comply with these new regulations  or be forced to make significant capital expenditures or changes to our operations  our business exposes us to potential environmental or regulatory liability  and we could be required to pay substantial amounts with respect to these liabilities  including the costs to clean up and close contaminated sites  we may not have adequate insurance for potential liabilities  and any significant liability not covered by insurance or in excess of our coverage limits could have a material adverse affect on our financial condition  our international operations are subject to uncertainties which could limit our ability to expand or reduce the revenues and profitability of these operations  including difficulties and cost associated with complying with a wide variety of complex foreign laws  treaties and regulations  unexpected changes in regulatory environments  inadequate protection of intellectual property in foreign countries  legal uncertainties  timing delays and expenses associated with tariffs  export licenses and other trade barriers  among other risks  and any increases in interest rates under our credit facility  either as a result of increases in the prime or libor rates or as a result of changes in our funded debt to cash flow ratio  would increase our cost of borrowing and have an adverse affect on our consolidated financial statements 
we may not be able to retire or refinance our long term debt at or before its maturity  whether due to conditions in financial markets or our own financial condition at that future time 
we also can t provide any assurances that we will be able to obtain any replacement long term financing on terms as favorable to us as under our current financing
