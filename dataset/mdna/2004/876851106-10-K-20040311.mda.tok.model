for purposes of calculating the ratio of earnings to fixed charges  earnings consist of income before income taxes and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle plus interest and rent expense 
fixed charges consist of interest expense  rent expense and preferred stock dividend requirements 
nonperforming loans includes nonaccrual loans and loans contractually past due days or more but still accruing interest

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis presents our consolidated financial condition at december  and and the results of operations for the years ended december   and this discussion should be read together with the selected consolidated financial data  our audited financial statements and the notes thereto and other financial data contained elsewhere in this annual report 
in addition to the historical information provided below  we have made certain estimates and forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ significantly from those anticipated in these estimates and forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those discussed in the section captioned risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report 
all share and per share information for all periods presented has been adjusted for a three for two split of our common stock that was effected as a dividend to stockholders of record as of october  overview we are a bank holding company headquartered in rosemont  illinois  a suburb of chicago 
we derive virtually all of our revenue from our subsidiary  cole taylor bank 
we provide a range of products and services to our commercial and consumer customers  and currently operate banking facilities throughout the chicago metropolitan area 
we reported net income for the year ended december  of million  or per diluted common share  compared to a net loss of million during  or a loss of per common share 
the net loss reported in was the result of a charge of million in connection with the settlement of litigation associated with the company s acquisition of the bank in see the section of this discussion and analysis captioned litigation and settlement for further details of the litigation settlement charge 
without the net million litigation settlement charge  the company would have recorded net income of million  or per diluted common share in the lower net income in  as compared to the period exclusive of the litigation settlement charge  was primarily a result of decreased net interest income and noninterest income 
the decline in diluted earnings per share was also a result of an increase in the number of common shares outstanding 
in october  the company issued  additional shares in an initial public offering 
exclusive of the litigation settlement charge  net income in of million was higher than the reported net income in of million  or per diluted common share 
net income during was positively impacted by the adoption of a new accounting standard on january  that ceased the amortization of goodwill 
net income in included million of goodwill amortization expense 
see the section captioned notes to consolidated financial statements goodwill and intangible assets of our audited financial statements contained elsewhere in this annual report for additional details 
excluding goodwill amortization  net income during would have been million  or per diluted share 
despite the modest increase in pro forma net income in  pro forma diluted earnings per share comparison declined between and due to the additional common shares issued in october management uses certain non gaap financial measures and ratios to evaluate the company s performance 
specifically  management reviews net income and the related earnings per share amounts excluding the million litigation settlement charge during and the amortization of goodwill  which ceased in we believe that excluding the non recurring litigation settlement charge from both net income and earnings per share presents a more suitable comparison of our period to period results because of the extraordinary nature of the litigation that led to the settlement charge and the likelihood that such a significant event will not reoccur 
in addition  we believe that excluding the amortization of goodwill in allows a better comparison of 
table of contents period to period results because of the change in method of accounting for goodwill 
the following table reconciles net income as reported under generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  on the company s consolidated statements of income to the non gaap pro forma net income

total loans increased to billion at december  from billion at year end  an increase of million  or 
total deposits were billion at december   a million  or  increase as compared to total deposits at december  of billion 
stockholders equity was million at december   an increase of million as compared to stockholders equity of million at december  litigation and settlement during  we agreed to settle outstanding litigation concerning our acquisition of the bank 
we entered into certain settlement agreements with the plaintiffs and other parties in the cases to halt the substantial expense  inconvenience  and distraction of continued litigation and to eliminate any exposure and uncertainty that may have existed as a result of such litigation 
these agreements provided that  subject to our completion of a public offering of trust preferred and common securities and the dismissal of the lawsuits  we would pay an amount equal to million  plus a contingent amount based on the offering price of the common shares  minus a minimum of million as a partial reimbursement to us of offering expenses 
the settlement of this litigation was completed on october  following our initial public offering of common stock and trust preferred securities 
from the net proceeds of these offerings  we paid million in full satisfaction of our obligation under the settlement agreements 
we recorded a million charge to earnings in to reflect the cost of settling this litigation 
initial public offering on october   we completed a concurrent offering of common stock and trust preferred securities 
we issued  shares of common stock at an initial public offering price of per share 
concurrently  we raised million of gross proceeds through the issuance of million aggregate principal amount of cumulative  mandatory redeemable trust preferred securities by tayc capital trust i the trust  a delaware statutory trust formed by us to issue the trust preferred securities 
the trust is our wholly owned subsidiary 
see the section captioned notes to consolidated financial statements trust preferred securities of our audited financial statements contained elsewhere in this annual report for additional details on the trust preferred securities 

table of contents on november   we sold an additional  shares of common stock to our underwriters pursuant to an option granted in connection with the initial public offering to cover over allotments 
we received additional net proceeds of million from this sale 
the total net amount raised from the initial public offering of common stock and the trust preferred securities and the subsequent exercise by our underwriters of the over allotment option was million 
in addition to the million payment to settle the litigation described above  we used million to restructure and reduce our outstanding indebtedness 
application of critical accounting policies our accounting and reporting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and general reporting practices within the financial services industry 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
our accounting policies are contained in the section of this annual report captioned notes to consolidated financial statements summary of significant accounting and reporting policies 
certain accounting policies require us to use significant judgment and estimates  which can have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities 
we consider these policies to be critical accounting policies 
the judgment and assumptions made by us are based upon historical experience or other factors which we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
because of the nature of the judgment and assumptions  actual results could differ from these judgments and estimates which could have a material affect on our financial condition and results of operations 
the following accounting policies materially affect our reported earnings and financial condition and require significant judgments and estimates 
allowance for loan losses we have established an allowance for loan losses to provide for loans in our portfolio that may not be repaid in their entirety 
we maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level considered adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in our portfolio as of the balance sheet date 
in evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses  we consider numerous quantitative factors including historical charge off experience  growth of our loan portfolio  changes in the composition of our loan portfolio and the volume of delinquent and criticized loans 
in addition  we use information about specific borrower situations  including their financial position  work out plans and estimated collateral values under various liquidation scenarios to estimate the risk and amount of loss for those borrowers 
finally  we also consider many qualitative factors including general and economic business conditions  duration of the current business cycle  the impact of competition on our underwriting terms  current general market collateral valuations  trends apparent in any of the factors we take into account and other matters  which are by nature more subjective and fluid 
the significant uncertainties surrounding our portfolio of borrowers abilities to successfully execute their business models through changing economic environments and competitive challenges as well as management and other changes greatly complicates the estimate of the risk of loss and amount of loss on any loan 
because of the degree of uncertainty and susceptibility of these factors to change  actual losses may vary from current estimates 
as a business bank  our loan portfolio is comprised primarily of commercial loans to businesses  the loans to which are inherently larger in amount than loans to individual consumers 
the individually larger commercial loans can cause greater volatility in reported credit quality performance measures  such as total impaired or nonperforming loans 
for example  our current credit risk rating and loss estimate with respect to a single 
table of contents material loan can have a material impact on our reported impaired loans and related loss exposure estimates 
we review our estimates on a quarterly basis and  as we identify changes in estimates  the allowance for loan losses is adjusted through the recording of a provision for loan losses 
goodwill impairment we have goodwill of million that we recognized in connection with our acquisition of the bank 
we test this goodwill annually for impairment  or whenever events or significant changes in circumstances indicated that the carry value may not be recoverable 
most recently  we tested goodwill for impairment as of july  and no impairment charge was necessary 
the evaluation for impairment includes comparing the estimated fair market value of the bank to our carrying value for the bank 
because there is not a readily observable market value for the bank  the estimation of the fair market value is based on the market price of our common stock adjusted for the preferred stock  trust preferred securities  and the notes payable at the holding company 
income taxes at times  we apply different tax treatment for selected transactions for tax return purposes than for income tax financial reporting purposes 
the different positions result from the varying application of statutes  rules  regulations  and interpretations  and our accruals for income taxes include reserves for these differences in position 
our estimate of the value of these reserves contains assumptions based upon our past experience and judgments about potential actions by taxing authorities  and we believe that the level of these reserves are reasonable 
the reserves are utilized or reversed once the statute of limitations has expired or the matter is otherwise resolved 
it is likely that the ultimate resolution of these matters may be greater or less than the amounts we have accrued 
results of operations as of and for the years ended december    and net interest income net interest income is the difference between total interest income earned on interest earning assets  including investment securities and loans  and total interest expense paid on interest bearing liabilities  including deposits and other borrowed funds 
net interest income is our principal source of earnings 
the amount of net interest income is affected by changes in the volume and mix of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and the level of rates earned or paid on those assets and liabilities 
year ended december  as compared to year ended december  net interest income was million during the year ended december   as compared to million during  a decrease of million  or 
with an adjustment for tax exempt income  our consolidated net interest income was million  a decrease of million  or  as compared to million during the net interest income declined because of compression in our net interest margin  despite an increase in average interest earning assets 
the tax equivalent net interest margin was during compared to during the annual period in the continued low interest rate environment has negatively impacted our net interest margin 
our interest earning asset yield declined basis points to during from during however  the cost of interest bearing liabilities declined only basis points from during to during the million of junior subordinated debentures  which were issued in october  caused approximately basis points of the decline in the net interest margin between the two annual periods 
the tax equivalent net interest spread  which is the difference between the weighted average yield on interest earning assets and the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities  was during as compared to during average interest earning assets during rose to billion  an increase of million  or  as compared to average interest earning assets of billion during the growth in the loan portfolio accounted for the majority of the increase in average interest earning assets 
an increase in cash equivalent 
table of contents balances of million accounted for the remainder of the growth in average interest earning assets 
average loan balances were billion during the compared to billion during the year ago period 
a million  or  increase in average commercial and commercial real estate loans produced most of the loan growth 
the increase in these loan balances was partly offset by lower residential mortgage  home equity and consumer loans  products that we chose to de emphasize 
between the two annual periods  the yield on loans declined basis points to during as compared to during the asset growth was funded with interest bearing deposit balances  with time deposit balances comprising the majority of the increase 
average time deposit balances increased to million during compared to million during higher average brokered and out of market certificates of deposit produced the majority of the increase 
if the current historically low interest rate environment continues  we would expect it to have a negative impact on our net interest margin and  therefore  our net interest income 
our portfolios of investment securities and loans still contain assets with yields above the current market rates 
therefore  as higher rate assets cash flow and are replaced with current yield assets  we will experience continued downward pressure on our overall earning assets yield 
see the section of this discussion and analysis captioned quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risks for further discussion on the impact of interest rates 
year ended december  as compared to year ended december  net interest income was million during the year ended december   as compared to million during  an increase of million  or 
with an adjustment for tax exempt income  our consolidated net interest income was million  an increase of million  or  as compared to million during an increase in average interest earning assets as well as a higher net interest margin produced the increase in both net interest income and tax exempt income adjusted net interest income 
net interest margin increased to during as compared to during the significant decline in market interest rates between the two periods caused both the yield on interest earning assets and the cost of interest bearing liabilities to fall 
however  the decline in the cost of interest bearing liabilities was larger  resulting in an overall increase in the net interest margin 
between the two periods  the cost of interest bearing liabilities declined basis points  while the yield on interest earning assets declined by basis points 
the larger decline in the cost of interest bearing liabilities also caused the net interest spread to increase to during as compared to during during  average interest earning assets totaled billion  an increase of million  or  as compared to average interest earning assets of billion during most of the increase in average interest earning assets occurred in loans  which increased to billion during  an increase of million  or  as compared to billion during the increase in average loan balances resulted from higher average commercial and commercial real estate loans of million and home equity and consumer loans of million  partly offset by a decrease in residential mortgage loans 
the yield on interest earning assets declined basis points to during as compared to during declining market interest rates  including a basis point reduction in the bank s prime lending rate during  caused the decrease in the yield because much of the commercial loan and home equity line portfolios are indexed to the bank s prime lending rate 
on the funding side  the declining interest rate environment also lowered our cost of funds 
the cost of interest bearing liabilities decreased basis points to during as compared to during our cost of deposits decreased basis points while our cost of borrowings declined by basis points 
the net interest margin in was impacted  to a limited extent  by the issuance of the million of trust preferred securities on october  as part of our evaluation of net interest income  we review our consolidated average balances  our yield on average interest earning assets  and the costs of average interest bearing liabilities 
such yields and costs are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balance of assets or liabilities 
because management reviews net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis  the analysis contains certain non gaap financial measures 
in these non gaap financial measures  interest income and net interest income are adjusted to reflect tax exempt interest income on an equivalent before tax basis assuming an effective tax rate of 
this assumed rate may differ from our actual effective income tax rate 
in addition  the earning asset yield  net interest 
table of contents margin  and the net interest rate spread are adjusted to a fully taxable equivalent basis 
we believe that these measures and ratios present a more meaningful measure of the performance of interest earning assets because they provide a better basis for comparison of net interest income regardless of the mix of taxable and tax exempt instruments 
the following table reconciles the tax equivalent net interest income to net interest income as reported on the consolidated statements of income 
in addition  the earning asset yield  net interest margin and net interest spread are shown with and without the tax equivalent adjustment

net interest spread represents the difference between the average yield on interest earning assets and the average cost of interest bearing liabilities 
net interest margin is determined by dividing taxable equivalent net interest income by average interest earning assets 

table of contents the following table presents  for the periods indicated  a summary of the changes in interest earned and interest paid resulting from changes in volume and rates for the major components of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities on a fully taxable equivalent basis

for additional information concerning this determination  see the sections of this discussion and analysis captioned application of critical accounting policies allowance for loan losses  nonperforming assets and impaired loans and allowance for loan losses 
our provision for loan losses was million for  a decrease of  as compared to the provision of million in the provision for was lower than for due to a more favorable outlook  based on our evaluation of key qualitative factors  including the economic environment and the continuing improvement in our credit administration 
net charge offs totaled million in our million provision for loan loss in was  higher than the provision of million for this increase was primarily a result of quantitative factors including the increase in commercial loans and loans with less favorable risk ratings 
net charge offs totaled million in we expect our provisioning to fluctuate as the circumstances of our individual commercial borrowers and the economic environment changes 
accordingly  the provision for loan losses in any accounting period is not an indicator of provisioning in subsequent reporting periods 

table of contents noninterest income the following table presents  for the periods indicated  our major categories of noninterest income year ended december  in thousands service charges trust and investment management fees gain on sale of trust assets mortgage banking activities gain on sale of investment securities  net other noninterest income total noninterest income our noninterest income was million during compared to million during  a decrease of million or 
most of the decline is related to gains on the sale of investment securities of million and certain trust assets of  during in addition  lower trust and investment management fees and revenues from mortgage banking activities also contributed to the decline 
noninterest income during was million  or  lower than noninterest income of million during the decline in was primarily a result of lower mortgage banking revenues and trust fees  partly offset by a slight increase in service charges and the  gain on the sale of certain trust assets 
service charges arise principally on deposit accounts 
service charges were essentially unchanged in at million compared to million in service charges during were  or higher than service charges of million during reported service charge income is impacted by a number of factors including the volume of deposit service transactions  the price established for each deposit service  the earnings credit rate and the collected balances customers maintain in their commercial checking accounts 
the increase in service charge income in as compared to was primarily due to the declining earnings credit rate in the average earnings credit rate in was approximately basis points lower than during the earnings credit rate is the credit given to customers for their collected checking account balances 
that credit is available to offset deposit service transaction fees on the customer s account 
the average earnings credit rate declined basis points during as compared to trust and investment management fees declined to million during  a decrease of  or as compared to million during trust revenues have declined because of our exit from fiduciary personal and employee benefit trust services in late in the second half of  we sold a portion of these lines of trust business and recorded a gain of  we continue to provide corporate trust  land trust and tax deferred exchange trust services 
we also generate fees from our wealth management services  including financial planning  insurance  and asset management services 
trust and investment management fees in were million  or  lower than the million of fees during the decline was due to the sale of trust assets in the second half of and higher than expected run off in the trust business we acquired in october we incurred losses related to our mortgage banking activities of  during the losses resulted from indemnification agreements on loans sold in prior periods 
as of december   we had approximately million of loans that we had sold in prior years for which we had agreed to indemnify a third party for losses that may result from underwriting or documentation deficiencies 
the losses recorded in include actual indemnification losses incurred to date as well as our estimate of future losses from sold loans still outstanding and subject to such indemnification agreements 
revenue from mortgage banking activities was  and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in  we discontinued the 
table of contents origination of mortgages for sale into the secondary market and the origination of first mortgage loans for non bank customers 
in  we ceased most other mortgage banking activities 
we recorded no gains or losses on the sale of investment securities in net gains on the sale of available for sale investment securities totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
during  we sold million of us government agency securities at a gain of million and reinvested the proceeds in us government agency securities with longer maturities to extend the duration of the investment portfolio 
the securities sales in resulted from a restructuring of a portion of the investment portfolio in which us government agency securities that were maturing within the next two years were sold at a gain and replaced with longer term mortgage related securities 
other noninterest income  which principally includes letters of credit fees  fees from financial services ie  the sale of insurance and other financial services products  atm fees from non customer accounts  and safe deposit rental fees  totaled million  million and million  during the years ended december    and  respectively 
the increase in  as compared to  resulted from higher fees received primarily from performance stand by letters of credit relating to our residential real estate construction financing 
other noninterest income in included  of proceeds received from key man life insurance policies following the death of sidney taylor  the former chairman of the company s executive committee 
noninterest expense the following table presents for the periods indicated the major categories of noninterest expense for the year ended december  in thousands salaries and employee benefits occupancy of premises lease abandonment charge building sale write down furniture and equipment holding company legal fees  net bank legal fees  net advertising and public relations corporate insurance computer processing consulting goodwill amortization other intangible assets amortization other real estate and repossessed asset expense litigation settlement charge other noninterest expense total noninterest expense our noninterest expense in was million compared to million during excluding the litigation settlement charge of million in  noninterest expense for would have decreased million  or  as compared to lower net legal fees and salaries and benefits expense contributed to the decrease in noninterest expense in these declines in noninterest expense were partially offset by a million charge related to the abandonment of a leased facility 
noninterest expense in was million 
table of contents and included million of goodwill amortization expense 
as a result of a new accounting standard adopted on january   goodwill is no longer amortized 
without the litigation settlement expense in and the amortization expense of goodwill during  noninterest expense during would have increased by million  or  over noninterest expense in the increase between the two periods was mainly produced by higher legal fees  advertising  corporate insurance  and other expense 
salaries and employee benefits represent the largest category of our noninterest expense 
during  salaries and employee benefit expense totaled million  a million  or  decrease as compared to million of expense in the decline in salaries and benefits in was due to a million decline in incentive compensation and a million decline in severance 
base salary expense remained relatively flat as the effect of fewer employees was partially offset by merit and job grade increases 
at december   we had full time equivalent employees as compared to full time equivalent employees at december  salaries and employee benefits expense in was  or  higher than the expense of million in additional severance expense of million in  partly offset by savings of approximately million in salaries and commissions from the exit of mortgage banking activities  caused the increase in expense during the period 
an increase in base salaries also contributed to the increase during the higher base salary expense was due to an increase in average salary per employee as we began to increase the number of professionals in our core banking business 
we had full time equivalent employees at december   compared to full time equivalent employees at december  during we also had million of additional expense related to the employee stock ownership plan  or esop 
in connection with the acquisition of the bank in  we entered into an agreement with the esop trustee that required us to value the shares that were in the esop at the time of acquisition control value shares at the same value that the shares of the controlling owners were valued 
semi annually  we obtained an appraisal that computed separate values for minority shareholders and a separate value  with a premium  for the control value shares 
in contemplation of our initial public offering  we and the esop trustee agreed to terminate the original agreement and  in consideration for the termination  we paid into the esop a control value cash premium of million for those participants in the esop with control value shares 
an estimate of the control value premium was recorded during the fourth quarter of when the agreement between us and the esop trustee was signed  and was adjusted during the first quarter of when the third party appraisal was completed and the actual control value premium was calculated 
our occupancy of premises expense increased  or  to million during from million during most of the increase was associated with the additional space leased for our new corporate center 
during september and october  we transitioned our administrative and operations departments to our new corporate center  a  square feet leased office space in rosemont  illinois 
departments that transitioned to the corporate center were previously located in our wheeling  ashland  and burbank facilities 
we are currently considering alternatives for each of these facilities 
our occupancy of premises expense could vary in future periods depending on the timing and success of our disposition of excess space at these facilities and the potential addition of new banking facilities 
see the section of this discussion and analysis captioned financial condition non earning assets for additional details 
in october of  we also closed our jackson customer banking center just before its lease expired 
we directed customers who had used this facility to another customer banking center located nearby 
occupancy of premises expense declined  or  in from the million of expense in the decline was primarily due to lower lease expense  primarily because we closed our cicero customer banking facility in january when the lease expired 
our customers were directed to another of our facilities located less than one mile from the cicero facility 
in connection with the corporate center consolidation  we abandoned our administrative offices on the second and third floors of our wheeling facility 
upon ceasing to use this space  we recorded a million lease abandonment charge 
the charge was comprised of a  write off of leasehold improvements  furniture 
table of contents and other equipment that were abandoned and a million charge for the liability related to the operating lease 
this million charge was computed based upon the remaining lease payments  reduced by estimated sublease rentals that could reasonably be obtained from the property 
the charge represents the estimated liability for the lease payments that we will incur for the remaining term of the lease for which we will receive no future economic benefit other than through subleasing 
the abandonment liability will be adjusted over the remaining term of lease 
the operating lease is scheduled to end march in addition  as part of the plan of consolidation  during the fourth quarter of  we entered into an agreement to sell our ashland branch facility and a  loss was recorded to write down the asset to the contracted selling price  less the cost to sell 
we expect to complete the sale during the first half of furniture and equipment expense was million during both and we expect that this expense may increase in the future as we amortize the new furniture and equipment acquired in the fourth quarter of in connection with the corporate center consolidation 
furniture and equipment expense in was million  or  higher than in technology and computer equipment that was placed in service for year readiness became fully depreciated during holding company legal fees during consist primarily of costs for general corporate matters  including securities law compliance and other costs associated with being a publicly traded company 
during and prior years  holding company legal fees included costs related to the defense and settlement of litigation concerning our acquisition of the bank 
portions of our defense costs related to the litigation  which were recorded as expenses in previous periods  had been submitted to insurance carriers for reimbursement 
during and  we received a million and million reimbursement of such legal costs  respectively 
we received no such reimbursements in and we do not expect to receive any further reimbursements related to that litigation 
as a result of the reimbursement received in  we reported a net reimbursement of holding company legal fees of million compared to an expense of million during holding company legal fees totaled  in or  less than in  primarily because of the legal fee reimbursements during bank legal fees relate to collection activities as well as general corporate and compliance matters 
legal fees were million during compared to million during and million during the higher legal fees in were primarily caused by increased collection activity and professional fees related to our decision to exit some non core lines of business and to develop new products and services for our core business banking customers 
advertising and public relations expense increased to million during the year ended december   as compared to million during and million of expense in our advertising expense increased in and because of a media campaign to increase the bank s visibility in the business community 
this campaign included television commercials  which began airing in  and print advertising 
during  we also introduced a new corporate identity with a more contemporary logo 
the costs of producing the television commercials were capitalized in and and are being amortized  beginning in  over three years  which is the expected time horizon over which the commercials will be aired 
the amortization expense during was  at december  and  the balance of capitalized advertising costs totaled  and  respectively 
corporate insurance totaled million during  compared to million and  during and  respectively 
the increase in expense was caused by higher costs for our directors and officers insurance policy associated with market driven costs  including those of becoming a publicly traded company 
insurance expense was higher in from a full year s impact of the higher premium 
our computer processing expense is comprised of payments to third party processors  primarily for our mission critical data processing applications including loans  deposits  and general ledger and atm operations 

table of contents our computer processing expense was million during  compared to million during and million during a slight decline in expense for our primary data processing vendor caused the decline during as compared to consulting expense was million  million  and million during the years ended december    and  respectively 
the higher expense in was due to projects undertaken during that year that related to information technology  strategic and facilities planning  and marketing consultation 
goodwill amortization expense of million during related to the goodwill created when we acquired the bank in a new accounting standard adopted on january  eliminated the amortization expense on goodwill 
upon adoption  we had million of goodwill that will no longer be subject to amortization  but will be subject to possible write downs based upon annual impairment testing 
at december   we had  of intangible assets related to the purchase of lines of trust business 
the intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful life  which is periodically reevaluated 
other intangible assets amortization expense was   and  during   and  respectively 
during  we accelerated the amortization of the intangible asset associated with an acquisition of trust business we purchased in october because the decrease in revenue related to this business exceeded our initial expectations 
at december   the intangible asset associated with this october purchase had been fully amortized 
the remaining intangible is scheduled to be amortized at  per year for the next five years 
other real estate and repossessed asset expense was  during the year ended december   compared to expense of  and  during and  respectively 
this net expense is influenced to a large degree by the number and complexity of properties being maintained pending their sale 
noninterest expense in reflects a million charge related to our settlement of the split off litigation 
this settlement was funded with a portion of the net proceeds from the concurrent offerings of common stock and trust preferred securities completed in october see the section of this discussion and analysis captioned litigation and settlement for additional details 
the amount of the settlement was based  in part  on the anticipated initial public offering price of our common stock 
after completion of the initial public offering in october  we paid million in full satisfaction of our settlement agreements 
other noninterest expense principally includes certain professional fees  fdic insurance  outside services  operating losses and other operating expenses such as telephone  postage  office supplies  and printing 
other noninterest expense was million during  compared to million during two events were the primary causes of the decrease in this expense during as compared to first  during because of negative trends in the manufactured housing industry  we recorded a million charge to establish a reserve related to interest receivable carried in connection with our indirect originated consumer loans secured by manufactured homes 
this reserve was increased by  in the reserve represents our estimate of the portion of this prepaid interest receivable that may not be collectable 
second  during  we recorded an  charge related to consideration paid for the contractual termination of a revenue sharing agreement associated with the trust business acquired in october as part of that acquisition  we had agreed to share a portion of the trust revenues earned on the accounts purchased over the following five years 
in connection with our exit of certain fiduciary trust activities we have sold some of the trust accounts that were subject to this revenue sharing agreement 
in addition  lower outside services  operating losses  which primarily related to non employee initiated fraud involving either loan or deposit accounts  employee training and development  and other professional services contributed to the decrease in as compared to other noninterest expense were million during or million less than in addition to the charges related to the manufactured home loan portfolio and the trust contract termination  increases in armored car services  computer software  and employee training and development caused the increase in expense between and 
table of contents income taxes we recorded income tax expense of million during  resulting in an effective income tax rate of 
the effective tax rate in was impacted by the recognition of a million income tax benefit relating to allocated tax reserves representing expenses deducted on a prior year s tax return  unrelated to the litigation settlement 
despite a net loss during  we recorded income tax expense of million primarily because we did not recognize any income tax benefit for financial reporting purposes with respect to the litigation settlement charge of million 
while we have not recognized any income tax benefit for financial reporting purposes for this charge  we did deduct a portion of the settlement on our tax return 
we will recognize the income tax benefit on our financial statements when we determine that it is probable that the position taken on our tax return will be sustained by the taxing authorities 
income tax expense during totaled million 
our effective income tax rate was approximately during impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of our financial position and operating results in terms of historical amounts without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of our operations 
unlike industrial companies  nearly all of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on our performance than do the effects of the general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or  to the same extent  as the price of goods and services 
financial condition our total assets increased million  or  during to billion at december  compared to billion at december  higher period end loan balances accounted for most of the increase 
total deposits reached billion at december   an increase of million  or  as compared to total deposits of billion at december  total stockholders equity increased million during to million at december  average interest earning assets during increased by million  or to total billion  as compared to billion during a million increase in average loan balances and a million increase in interest bearing cash equivalent balances combined to produce the increase in average interest earning assets 
interest bearing cash equivalents interest bearing cash equivalents consist of federal funds sold  deposits with the federal home loan bank  and investments in money market mutual funds managed by other financial institutions 
these balances are overnight or over weekend investments and are maintained primarily for liquidity management purposes 
investment securities our investment portfolio primarily serves as a source of income 
in addition  our investment portfolio is used as a source of liquidity and for interest rate risk management purposes 
in managing our investment portfolio within the composition of the entire balance sheet  we balance our earnings  credit and interest rate risk  and liquidity considerations  with a goal of maximizing longer term overall profitability

our investment portfolio totaled million at december   a decrease of million as compared to the investment portfolio of million at december  because of the continued low interest rate environment  the portfolio experienced significant repayments of mortgage related securities 
to offset these repayments  we purchased additional mortgage back securities  and to a lesser extent  collateralized mortgage obligations  or cmos  and us government agency securities during in addition  the unrealized gain on the available for sale portion of the portfolio declined million due to changes in market interest rates and prepayment speeds during the year 
at december   we had million of gross unrealized losses in the investment portfolio 
all the unrealized losses in the investment securities portfolio were associated with mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations  and of all these securities have been in a loss position for less than continuous months 
these unrealized losses were caused by changes in interest rates and prepayment speeds during the year 
we believe that none of these unrealized losses represent other than temporary impairments of our investment portfolio 
our investment portfolio totaled million at december   an increase of million over year end during  we sold approximately million of us government agency securities  at a gain 
table of contents of million  and reinvested the proceeds in other us government agency securities with longer maturities to extend the duration of the portfolio 
in addition  on january   upon adoption of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  we made a one time transfer of our state and municipal obligations  with a carrying value of million  from the held to maturity classification to the available for sale classification 
upon reclassification  we recorded a gross unrealized gain of  a deferred tax liability of  and a net increase to stockholders equity of  investment portfolio maturity and yields the following table summarizes the contractual maturity of investment securities and their weighted average yields as of december  within one year after one but within five years after five but within ten years after ten years total amount yield amount yield amount yield amount yield total yield dollars in thousands available for sale securities us government agency securities collateralized mortgage obligations mortgage backed securities states and political subdivisions total available for sale held to maturity securities other debt securities total held to maturity total securities based on estimated fair value 
maturities of mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations cmos are based on anticipated lives of the underlying mortgages  not contractual maturities 
cmo maturities are based on cash flow or payment windows derived from broker market consensus 
rates on obligations of states and political subdivisions have been adjusted to tax equivalent yields using a income tax rate 
based on amortized cost 
investments in us treasury securities and us government agency securities are generally considered to have low credit risk 
our mortgage backed securities holdings consist principally of direct pass through securities issued by the fannie mae formerly known as federal national mortgage association and freddie mac formerly known as the federal home loan mortgage corporation 
these securities are also considered to have low credit risk  but do possess market value risk due to the prepayment risk associated with mortgage backed securities 
our cmos consist primarily of planned amortization class securities that are backed by fixed rate  single family mortgage loans 
although cmos are guaranteed as to principal and interest by certain agencies  primarily fannie mae and freddie mac  they possess market risk due to the prepayment risk associated with the underlying collateral 
we generally invest in state and municipal obligations that are rated investment grade by nationally recognized rating organizations 
however  certain municipal issues  which are restricted to our local market area  are not rated and undergo the bank s standard underwriting procedures for loan transactions 
we also have investments in federal reserve bank stock and federal home loan bank stock which are required to be maintained for various purposes 
at december   we held no securities of any single issuer  other than us government agency securities  that exceeded of stockholders equity 
although we hold securities issued by municipalities within the state of illinois that  in the aggregate  exceed of stockholders equity  none of the holdings from any individual municipal issue exceed this threshold 
approximately of our investment securities portfolio at december  was used as collateral for public funds deposits and securities sold under agreements to repurchase 

table of contents loan portfolio our primary source of income is interest on loans 
the following table presents the composition of our loan portfolio by type of loan as of the dates indicated as of december  in thousands commercial and industrial commercial real estate real estate construction residential real estate mortgages mortgage loans held for sale home equity loans and lines of credit consumer other loans gross loans less unearned discount total loans less allowance for loan losses loans  net at december    and  our gross loans totaled billion  billion  and billion  respectively 
most of the growth in the loan portfolio during was in the commercial real estate and real estate construction portfolios 
these increases more than offset the run off experienced in the consumer oriented loan products that we chose to de emphasize 
during  we discontinued origination of indirect auto and manufactured homes and de emphasized first mortgage products 
at the end of  we ceased acquiring home equity loans and lines from mortgage brokers 
beginning in  we referred conforming first mortgage loans to a third party 
as a result of these changes  the impact of our commercial lending portfolios on our overall performance has increased 
commercial and industrial c i loans were million  million  and million  at december    and  respectively 
these loans have represented between and of our portfolio over the last three years 
commercial and industrial loans are one of our core products 
after experiencing increasing growth during  and  this portfolio remained essentially flat in we believe  based on information published by the federal reserve bank  that c i loan outstandings at many commercial banks have declined over the last two years  indicating overall soft c i loan demand 
in addition  as a consequence of some of our borrowers experiencing operating difficulties  certain large customers with outstanding loans between and million were administered out of the bank because we were no longer comfortable with the credit quality characteristics of the customer 
while total commercial credit line commitments increased  the percentage of the total commercial credit lines actually drawn on by the borrowers declined to in as compared to in and in loans secured by commercial real estate have been a growing portion of our commercial portfolio 
these loans totaled million  million  and million  at december    and  respectively 
our commercial real estate loans  as a percentage of total loans  increased to at december   compared to at december  and at december  our commercial real estate loans consist of commercial owner occupied and investment properties 
the growth in commercial real estate loans in and related primarily to investment properties 
commercial real estate lending has remained strong over the last two years as historically low interest rates have added to the attractiveness of real estate investments 

table of contents our real estate construction loans totaled million  million and million at december   and  respectively 
the portfolio  as a percentage of gross loans  was   and at december    and  respectively 
these loans consist primarily of loans to professional homebuilders and developers 
our real estate construction loans declined in as we reduced our construction lending in the condominium market 
growth in has been attributable to single family home development 
our portfolio of residential real estate mortgages continues to decline as a result of our decision to de emphasize this product in at december   this portfolio totaled million compared to million and million at december  and  respectively 
correspondingly  this portfolio as a percentage of gross loans has decreased to at year end from at the end of and at december  we expect that this portfolio of loans will continue to decline as we focus more on our core customers business needs 
in addition  in we stopped originating loans for sale into the secondary market  and as a result  we no longer have loans classified as held for sale 
our portfolio of home equity loans and lines of credit decreased to million at december  as compared to million at december  and million at december  this portfolio as a percentage of the total loan portfolio was   and at december    and  respectively 
at the end of  we made the strategic decision to discontinue the origination of third party sourced home equity products and as a result  this portfolio declined during and is expected to continue to decline in future periods 
at december   approximately of our home equity loans and lines  after giving effect to any outstanding first mortgage loans  exceeded of the appraised value of the underlying real estate collateral 
the bank s general underwriting guidelines do not allow lines in excess of of appraised value 
approximately of our outstanding home equity loans and lines were originally sourced through mortgage brokers  but were still subject to the bank s underwriting standards 
consumer loans were million  million  and million at december    and  respectively

table of contents nonperforming assets and impaired loans lending officers and their managers are responsible for continuous review of present and estimated future performance of the loans within their assigned portfolio and for risk rating such loans in accordance with the bank s risk rating system 
in addition  our credit administration area directs an objective loan review process that independently risk rates loans to monitor and confirm the effectiveness of the lending officer s loan risk rating conclusion 
delinquency reports are reviewed monthly by the lending officers  their managers and credit administration 
the current status of loans past due or current but graded below a designated level is reported by the responsible lending officer to a loan committee where consideration is given to placing the loan on nonaccrual  the need for a specific allowance for loan loss  or  if appropriate  a partial or full charge off 
nonperforming loans include nonaccrual loans and interest accruing loans contractually past due days or more 
loans are placed on a nonaccrual basis for recognition of interest income when sufficient doubt exists as to the full collection of principal and interest 
generally  loans are to be placed on nonaccrual when principal and interest is contractually past due days  unless the loan is adequately secured and in the process of collection 
the following table sets forth the amounts of nonperforming loans and other assets as of the dates indicated as of december  dollars in thousands loans contractually past due days or more but still accruing interest nonaccrual loans total nonperforming loans other real estate other repossessed assets total nonperforming assets restructured loans not included in nonperforming assets nonperforming loans to total loans nonperforming assets to total loans plus repossessed property nonperforming assets to total assets impaired loans are identified by their internal credit risk rating of either substandard or doubtful 
certain homogenous loans  including residential mortgage and consumer loans  are collectively evaluated for impairment and  therefore  do not have individual credit risk ratings and are excluded from impaired loans 
impaired loans include all nonaccrual loans as well as accruing loans for which management has serious doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with the present contractual repayment schedule for both interest and principal 
loans where repayment is expected only through liquidation of collateral but without an expected loss are also included in this category 
a loan is not considered impaired during a period of insignificant delay if we expect to collect all amounts due through normal operations of the borrower 
once a loan has been determined to be impaired  it is measured to establish the amount of the impairment 
while impaired loans exhibit weaknesses that may inhibit repayment through the borrower s normal operations  the measurement of impairment may not always result in an allowance for loan loss for every impaired loan 
the amount in the allowance for loan losses for impaired loans is based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  except that collateral dependent loans may be measured for impairment based on the fair value of the collateral  net of cost to sell 

table of contents information about the impaired loans at or for the years ended december    and is as follows in thousands recorded balance of impaired loans  at end of year with related allowance for loan loss with no related allowance for loan loss total average balance of impaired loans for the year allowance for loan loss related to impaired loans interest income recognized on impaired loans in addition to the impaired loans  we continue to closely monitor the credit quality trends in the manufactured housing industry and its potential impact on our portfolio of loans secured by manufactured homes 
these trends could lead to higher net charge offs in the future 
at december   our consumer loan portfolio included million of loans to consumers secured by manufactured homes 
allowance for loan losses we have established an allowance for loan losses to provide for loans in our portfolio that may not be repaid in their entirety 
the allowance is based on our regular  quarterly assessments of the probable estimated losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
our methodology for measuring the appropriate level of the allowance relies on several key elements  which include the formula described below  specific allowances for identified problem loans and portfolio segments  and the unallocated allowance 
the formula portion of the allowance is calculated by applying loss factors to categories of loans outstanding in the portfolio 
the loans are categorized by loan type as commercial  residential real estate mortgage and consumer loans 
those categories are further segregated by risk classification and in some cases by delinquency status 
each commercial  commercial real estate and real estate construction loan has a risk grade based on formal defined criteria 
for consumer loans  we further categorize the loans into consumer loan product types  for example home equity loans over loan to value  home equity loans equal to or less than  and loans secured by manufactured homes 
segregation of the loans into more discrete pools facilitates greater precision in matching historic and expected loan losses with the source of the loss 
we adjust these pools from time to time  based on the changing composition of the loan portfolio  segmenting loans with similar attributes and risk characteristics 
we calculate actual historic loss rates for prior years for each separate loan segment identified 
each of the prior years historical loss rates is then weighted based on our evaluation of the duration of the economic cycle to arrive at a current expected loss rate 
the current expected loss rates are adjusted  if deemed appropriate  for other relevant factors affecting the segments  including changes in lending practices  trends in past due loans and industry  geographical  collateral and size concentrations 
finally  the resulting loss factors are multiplied against the current period loans outstanding to derive an estimated loss 
specific allowances are established in cases where management has identified significant conditions or circumstances related to a loan that indicate a loss will probably be incurred  but the degree of certainty and loss quantification has not reached the charge off level 
the amount in the allowance for loan losses for impaired loans is determined based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  except that collateral dependent loans may be measured for impairment based on the fair value of the collateral  net of cost to sell 
if the measure of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan  a specific allowance is established 
the unallocated portion of the allowance contains amounts that are based on management s evaluation of conditions that are not directly measured in the determination of the formula and specific allowances 
the 
table of contents evaluation of the inherent loss with respect to these conditions is subject to a higher degree of uncertainty because they are not identified with specific problem credits or portfolio segments 
the factors assessed are more qualitative in nature 
conditions affecting the entire lending portfolio evaluated in connection with the unallocated portion of the allowance include general economic and business conditions  duration of the current business cycle  the impact of competition on our underwriting terms  current general market collateral valuations and findings of our independent loan review process 
executive management reviews these conditions quarterly in discussion with our senior lenders and credit officers 
to the extent that any of these conditions is evidenced by a specifically identifiable problem credit or portfolio segment as of the evaluation date  management s estimate of the effect of such condition may be reflected as part of the formula allowance applicable to such credit or portfolio segment 
where any of these conditions is not evidenced by a specifically identifiable problem credit or portfolio segment  management s evaluation of the probable loss related to such conditions is reflected in the unallocated portion of the allowance 
although management believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate to absorb probable losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible  there can be no assurance that our allowance will prove sufficient to cover actual loan losses in the future 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require us to make additional provisions to the allowance based upon their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examinations

in each year  the provision for loan losses exceeded net charge offs 
as a business bank  our loan portfolio is comprised primarily of commercial loans to businesses  the loans to which are inherently larger in amount than loans to individual consumers 
the individually larger commercial loans can cause greater volatility in reported credit quality performance measures  such as total impaired or nonperforming loans 
for example  our current credit risk rating and loss estimate with respect to a single material loan can have a material impact on our reported impaired loans and related loss exposure estimates 
we review our estimates on a quarterly basis and  as we identify changes in estimates  the allowance for loan losses is adjusted through the recording of a provision for loan losses 
the table below presents an allocation of the allowance for loan losses among the various loan categories and sets forth the percentage of loans in each category to gross loans 
the allocation of the allowance for loan losses as shown in the table should neither be interpreted as an indication of future charge offs  nor as an indication that charge offs in future periods will necessarily occur in these amounts or in the indicated proportions

beginning on january   this goodwill is no longer subject to amortization 
goodwill is tested 
table of contents annually for impairment  and if at any time impairment exists  we will record an impairment loss

the increase in premises  leasehold improvements  and equipment is associated with the leasehold improvements and new furniture and equipment at this new facility 
in connection with our corporate center consolidation during the fourth quarter of  we abandoned our administrative offices on the second and third floors of our wheeling facility 
upon ceasing to use this space  we recorded a million lease abandonment charge  recorded in noninterest expense 
the charge was comprised of a  write off of leasehold improvements  furniture and other equipment that were abandoned and a million charge for the liability related to the operating lease 
this million charge was computed based upon the remaining lease payments reduced by estimated sublease rentals that could reasonably be obtained from the property 
the charge represents the estimated liability for the lease payments that we will incur for the remaining term of the lease for which we will receive no economic benefit other than through subleasing 
the liability for lease abandonment will be adjusted over the remaining term of lease 
the operating lease is scheduled to end march we still maintain space for a customer banking center on the ground floor of the building 
we continue to utilize a national real estate consultant to examine options concerning this facility  including subleasing the unused space on the second and third floors or termination of the total building lease  followed by a lease of space on the ground floor for the customer banking center 
we are also working with the real estate consultant to explore options regarding our burbank facility  which is an owned facility 
we vacated two of the four floors of the building when we moved the operating departments located in this facility to the corporate center 
we are investigating either the sale of the facility  followed by a lease of space on the ground and fourth floors for the existing customer service areas  or the lease of the vacated second and third floors 
during the fourth quarter of  we agreed to sell our existing ashland facility 
in connection with this sale  we recorded a  loss during we are currently obtaining the necessary approvals to demolish the existing structure  and we expect that the sale will be completed in the first half of we intend to retain a portion of the land that we own at the site to construct a smaller customer banking center 
until the new center is complete  we have relocated the customer banking center to a nearby temporary storefront location 
during the fourth quarter of  we closed our leased jackson customer banking facility 
the lease was scheduled to expire in the first quarter of the impact of this closure on our consolidated statements of income was not significant 
customers who used this facility were directed to another customer banking center located nearby 
on an ongoing basis we evaluate additional potential sites for new banking center locations 
we carefully assess the local market opportunity and explore facility options from leasing to acquisition and construction 
in connection with those activities  we sometimes enter into non binding letters of intent 
no firm commitments have been executed for additional sites at this time

during  our customer deposits declined  primarily due to two large deposit commercial customers who reduced money market deposits approximately million in noninterest bearing demand deposits increased from existing commercial customers as a result of the declining earnings credit rate and the decline in alternative short term investment rates as customer liquidity rose pending business investment 
over the years  our earning asset growth has exceeded our core deposit growth  which has resulted in our use of brokered and out of market certificates of deposit and other borrowed funds 
we offer certificates of deposit to out of market customers by providing rates to a private third party electronic system that provides certificate of deposit rates from institutions across the country to its subscribers

trust preferred securities the trust preferred securities are reported on our consolidated balance sheets under the caption guaranteed preferred beneficial interest in the company s junior subordinated debentures 
on october   we completed an offering of trust preferred securities by tayc capital trust i  a delaware statutory trust formed by us the trust 
the trust is our wholly owned subsidiary formed solely to issue the trust preferred securities 
the cumulative  mandatory redeemable trust preferred securities total million and have a liquidation amount of per trust preferred security 
proceeds from the sale of the trust preferred securities were invested by the trust in the junior subordinated debentures of taylor capital group  inc junior subordinated debentures 
the sole assets of the trust are the company s junior subordinated debentures 
see the section of this annual report captioned notes to consolidated financial statements trust preferred securities for additional details 
capital resources we monitor compliance with bank regulatory capital requirements  focusing primarily on the risk based capital guidelines 
under the risk based capital method of capital measurement  the ratio computed is dependent on the amount and composition of assets recorded on the balance sheet and the amount and composition of off balance sheet items  in addition to the level of capital 
generally  tier i capital includes common stockholders equity and our noncumulative perpetual preferred stock less goodwill 
the trust preferred securities also qualify as tier i capital up to certain limits 
total capital represents tier i capital plus the allowance for loan loss  subject to certain limits  our subordinated note payable and the portion of the trust preferred securities not includable in tier i capital 
at both december  and  the holding company was considered well capitalized under capital guidelines set by the federal reserve for bank holding companies 
although our total regulatory capital increased during  our ratios of total capital and tier i capital to risk weighted asset declined due to the increase in our total risk weighted assets 
the ratio of tier i capital to average assets increased however because the increase in average assets was not as large as the increase in year end risk weighted assets 
in  all of our capital ratios increased because of the additional capital provided by our concurrent offerings of common and trust preferred securities  as well as the addition of our subordinated note payable 
at december    and  the bank was considered well capitalized under regulatory capital guidelines 
all of the bank s capital ratios increased during  as the bank did not pay dividends to the holding company and growth in equity out paced the higher risk weighted and average assets 
during  the bank s capital ratios declined 
these declines were primarily a result of the growth in risk weighted and average

we also declared common stock dividends of per share in each of the last three years 
because of the increase in common shares outstanding  common stock dividends declared totaled million in  compared to million in and million in 
table of contents as of december   we had purchased  shares of our common stock  at a cost of million  which are held as treasury shares 
previously  under the terms of our esop  stock option agreements and the restricted stock program  we were obligated to purchase shares of our stock from terminated employees related to put rights 
we purchased  treasury stock shares during at a total cost of million and  shares at a total cost of million in following the completion of our common stock offering  we are no longer obligated to purchase shares of our stock under any of these plans and we purchased no additional treasury shares in we are currently evaluating alternatives to increase the efficiency of our capital structure 
this could include lowering the cost of our preferred stock  either through negotiation of an exchange for another capital vehicle or repurchase and retirement of that preferred class 
liquidity in addition to the normal influx of liquidity from core deposit growth  together with repayments and maturities of loans and investments  the bank utilizes brokered and out of market certificates of deposit  fhlb borrowings  broker dealer repurchase agreements and federal funds purchased to meet its liquidity needs 
we manage the risk associated with reliance on wholesale funding sources by extending and laddering the maturity of these liabilities and pledging collateral 
the fhlb borrowings are collateralized by the bank s first mortgage residential and home equity loans  selected investment securities  and fhlb stock 
in addition  the bank is able to borrow from the federal reserve bank using securities or commercial loans as collateral through the borrower in custody program 
the lendable value for the designated commercial loans is and approximated million at december  the bank also maintains pre approved overnight federal funds borrowing lines at various correspondent banks  which provide additional short term borrowing capacity of million at december  pre approved repurchase agreement availability with major brokers and banks totaled million at december   subject to acceptable unpledged marketable securities 
during  total assets grew by million  or 
the asset growth was funded almost equally by wholesale deposits and cash provided by operations 
most of the increase in wholesale deposits was from higher brokered cd balances 
cash inflows from operations exceeded cash outflows by million during we believe that our current sources of funds are adequate to meet all of our financial commitments and asset growth targets for during  our asset growth was primarily funded with wholesale funds 
during the year  we increased brokered and out of market certificates of deposit by million and million respectively  and increased our borrowings from the fhlb by million 
these additional wholesale sources provided funds for asset growth and net deposit outflows from customers 
the decline in customer deposit balances mainly occurred in money market account balances due to withdrawals by two large deposit commercial customers 
during the year ended december   cash outflows from operating activities exceeded cash inflows by million 
the net outflow was largely due to the million litigation settlement payment made during we used proceeds from the common stock and trust preferred securities offerings to fund this payment 
during  our asset growth in loans was funded primarily with growth in customer deposits 
during the year  most of the growth in customer deposits occurred in the interest bearing demand category with the largest increase occurring in the money market deposits  mainly due to large deposits by a few commercial customers  some of which transferred the funds from customer repurchase agreements 
funding from wholesale sources declined as average brokered and out of market certificates of deposit decreased by million during cash inflows from operating activities exceeded operating cash outflows by million 
interest received net of interest paid was the principal source of our operating cash inflows in each of the above periods 
management of investing and financing activities and market conditions determine the level and the stability of our net interest cash flows 

table of contents our net cash outflows from investing activities for the years ended december    and were million  million  and million  respectively 
during all three annual periods  the net outflow was caused by growth in loan balances 
during and  cash provided by repayments  maturities  and sales of investment securities were mostly reinvested in the purchase of additional investment securities 
in  net investment securities activity provided additional liquidity to meet funding needs 
our net cash inflows from financing activities for years ended december    and were million  million  and million  respectively 
during  the net inflow was primarily produced by a million increase in deposits  primarily from wholesale sources 
during  from the issuance of  common shares  net of issuance costs  we received proceeds of million  while we received net proceeds from the issuance of trust preferred securities of million 
in addition  during  cash inflows of million were also provided by deposit growth  primarily from wholesale funding sources 
we also used a portion of the proceeds from the common stock and trust preferred offerings to reduce our notes payable 
during  net financing cash inflows were mainly provided by deposit growth  including repurchase agreements 
holding company liquidity 
historically  our primary source of funds has been dividends received from the bank 
however  during the bank did not declare any dividends because we maintained sufficient liquidity from the proceeds of our concurrent offering of common and trust preferred securities during and the insurance reimbursement and estimated tax payment refund received in we received million of dividends from the bank during each of and our notes payable agreement with our lender limits the amount of common dividends that the bank can pay to us in any year to of that year s bank net income 
the bank is also subject to dividend restrictions set forth by regulatory authorities  whereby the bank may not  without prior approval of regulatory authorities  declare dividends in excess of the sum of the current year s earnings plus the retained earnings from the prior two years 
the dividends  as of december   that the bank could declare and pay to us  without the approval of regulatory authorities  amounts to approximately million 
we also have an million revolving credit facility  which was not drawn upon at december  our liquidity uses at the holding company level consist primarily of dividends to stockholders  debt service requirements on the debentures issued to tayc capital trust i  and expenses for general corporate purposes 
we expect the bank to resume paying us dividends during  and we believe that the bank currently has adequate capital to allow continued dividends out of earnings to support our expected liquidity demands arising from our normal operations 
during  we received net proceeds of million from the common stock offering and million from the trust preferred offering 
these proceeds are net of underwriters discount and issuance costs  such as legal and accounting fees and printing costs 
we used million of the net proceeds from the offerings on october  to fully satisfy our obligations under the litigation settlement agreements related to the acquisition of the bank 
we also used million of the net proceeds to restructure our notes payable and reduce outstanding indebtedness 
off balance sheet arrangements off balance sheet arrangements  include commitments to extend credit  financial guarantees and derivative financial instruments 
commitments to extend credit and financial guarantees are used to meet the financial needs of our customers 
derivative financial instruments are used to manage interest rate risk 
at december   we had million of commitments to extend credit and million of financial and performance standby letters of credit 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
many customers do not utilize the total approved commitment amounts 
historically  less than of available consumer and 
table of contents commercial loan commitment amounts are drawn 
therefore  the total commitment amounts do not usually represent future cash requirements 
financial standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by us to guarantee the payment of a specified financial obligation of a customer to a third party 
performance standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by us to make a payment to a specified third party in the event a customer fails to perform under a non financial contractual obligation 
the terms of these financial guarantees range from less than one to five years 
the credit risk involved in issuing these letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers 
we expect most of these letters of credit to expire undrawn and we expect no significant loss from our obligation under financial guarantees 
the following table shows as of december  the loan commitments and financial guarantees by maturity date 
december  within one year one to three years four to five years after five years total in thousands commitments to extend credit commercial consumer financial guarantees financial standby letters of credit performance standby letters of credit at december   our only derivative financial instruments were interest rate exchange contracts 
an interest rate exchange contract  or swap  is an agreement in which two parties agree to exchange  at specified intervals  interest payment streams calculated on an agreed upon notional principal amount with at least one stream based on a specified floating rate index 
our objective in holding interest rate swaps is interest rate risk management 
during and  we entered into interest rate exchange contracts with a notional amount totaling million to hedge the fair values of certain brokered certificates of deposits for changes in interest rates 
under these contracts  we will receive a fixed interest rate over the term of the agreement and will pay a floating interest rate based upon libor these contracts  which are accounted for as fair value hedges  satisfied the criteria in sfas no 
to use the short cut method of accounting for changes in fair value 
the short cut method allows us to assume that there is no ineffectiveness in the hedging relationship and that changes in the fair value of the derivative perfectly offset changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability  resulting in no volatility in earnings 
during the first quarter of  we were notified that one of the swaps  with a notional amount of million was being called by the counterparty 
once we were notified  we called the related brokered cds 
shortly thereafter  we entered into another interest rate exchange contract  with a notional amount of million to hedge the fair value of million of brokered cds 
during  we also entered into interest rate exchange contracts  with a total notional amount of million  to hedge the variability of cash flows of million of prime rate based commercial loans 
we accounted for these transactions as cash flow hedges 
in the cash flow hedges  we received a fixed rate and paid a variable rate based upon the prime lending rate 
in october  these interest rate exchange contracts were terminated with the original counterparties 
the resulting gain on termination  which totaled million  was deferred and recorded in other comprehensive income in stockholders equity 
this deferred gain will be reclassified as an adjustment to interest income over the remaining term of the original interest rate exchange contracts 
for the year ended december    of this deferred gain was reclassified into interest income  and  of this deferred gain is expected to be reclassified into interest income during

other types of market risk  such as foreign currency risk and commodity price risk  do not arise in the normal course of our business activities 
interest rate risk can be defined as the exposure to a movement in interest rates that could have an adverse effect on our net interest income or the market value of our financial instruments 
the ongoing monitoring and management of this risk is an important component of our asset and liability management process  which is governed by policies established by the board of directors and carried out by our asset liability management committee  or alco 
alco s objectives are to manage  to the degree prudently possible  our exposure to interest rate risk over both the one year planning cycle and the longer term strategic horizon and  at the same time  to provide a stable and steadily increasing flow of net interest income 
interest rate risk management activities include establishing guidelines for tenor and repricing characteristics of new business flow  the maturity ladder of wholesale funding and investment security purchase and sale strategies  as well as the use of derivative financial instruments 
we have used various interest rate contracts  such as floors and swaps to manage interest rate and market risk 
these contracts are designated as hedges of specific existing assets and liabilities 
our asset and liability management and investment policies do not allow the use of derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
our primary measurement of interest rate risk is earnings at risk  which is determined through computerized simulation modeling 
the primary simulation model assumes a static balance sheet  a parallel interest rate rising or declining ramp and uses the balances  rates  maturities and repricing characteristics of all of the bank s existing assets and liabilities  including off balance sheet financial instruments 
net interest income is computed by the model assuming market rates remaining unchanged and compares those results to other interest rate scenarios with changes in the magnitude  timing  and relationship between various interest rates 
the impact of imbedded options in products such as callable and mortgage backed securities  real estate mortgage loans  and callable borrowings are considered 
changes in net interest income in the rising and declining rate scenarios are then measured against the net interest income in the rates unchanged scenario 
alco utilizes the results of the model to quantify the estimated exposure of net interest income to sustained interest rate changes 
as predicted by our december  simulation  the net interest margin has declined in response to the interest rate environment 
our december  modeling indicates that even if market interest rates were to remain unchanged from year end levels  our earning asset yields would decline more than our liability rates  resulting in a reduced net interest margin 
our portfolios of investment securities and loans still contain assets with yields above the current market rates 
therefore  as higher rate assets cash flow and are replaced with current yields  we can expect to experience continued downward pressure on our net interest margin 

table of contents our simulation modeling also indicates that net interest income would be under further downward pressure if rates continued to fall  reflecting an exposure to declining market rates 
at december   net interest income at risk for year one in a basis points falling rate scenario was calculated at million  or  lower than the net interest income in the rates unchanged scenario 
conversely  net interest income for year one in a basis points rising rate scenario was calculated to be million  or  higher than the net interest income in the rates unchanged scenario at december  these exposures were within the bank s policy guidelines of 
the direction of our one year exposure to rising and declining interest rates at december  was generally consistent with our exposure at december  computation of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions  including  among other factors  relative levels of market interest rates  loan and security prepayments  deposit decay and pricing and reinvestment strategies and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
further  the computations do not contemplate any actions we may take in response to changes in interest rates 
we cannot assure you that our actual net interest income would increase or decrease by the amounts computed by the simulations 
the following table indicates the estimated impact on net interest income in year one under various parallel ramp interest rate scenarios at december  and change in future net interest income at december  at december  change in interest rates dollar change percentage change dollar change percentage change dollars in thousands basis points over one year basis points over one year basis points over one year we also model changes in the shape steepness of the yield curve  other parallel shifts in the yield  such as a basis point increase in interest rates  and balance sheet growth scenarios 
we also monitor the repricing terms of our assets and liabilities through gap matrix reports for the rates in unchanged  rising and falling interest rate scenarios 
the reports illustrate  at designated time frames  the dollar amount of assets and liabilities maturing or repricing 

table of contents the following table sets forth the bank s  on a stand alone basis  amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at december  which we anticipate  based upon certain assumptions  to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown 
the projected repricing of assets and liabilities anticipates prepayments and scheduled rate adjustments  as well as contractual maturities under an interest rate unchanged scenario within the selected time intervals 
while we believe such assumptions are reasonable  there can be no assurance that assumed repricing rates would approximate our actual future deposit activity

for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as adjustable rate loans  have features that restrict changes in interest rates  both on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
more importantly  changes in interest rates  prepayments and early withdrawal levels may deviate significantly from those assumed in the calculations in the table 
as a result of these shortcomings  we focus more on earnings at 
table of contents risk simulation modeling than on gap analysis 
even though the gap analysis reflects a ratio of cumulative gap to total assets within acceptable limits  the earnings at risk simulation modeling is considered by management to be more informative in forecasting future income at risk 
finally  we also monitor core funding utilization in each interest rate scenario as well as market value of equity 
these measures are used to evaluate long term interest rate risk beyond the two year planning horizon 
litigation we are from time to time a party to litigation arising in the normal course of business 
management knows of no such threatened or pending legal actions against us that are likely to have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition  liquidity or operating results

fin r with certain modifications and clarifications 
application of fin r was effective for interests in certain variable interest entities as of december   and for all other types of variable interest entities for periods ending after march   unless fin was previously applied 
the fin guidance requires that in we deconsolidate tayc capital trust i  our wholly owned subsidiary formed for the purpose of issuing trust preferred securities 
at december  and  this trust was consolidated and the trust preferred securities were reported on our consolidated balance sheets under the caption guaranteed preferred beneficial interest in the company s junior subordinated debentures 
the trust s cash distributions on the trust preferred securities were reported in interest expense  under a similar caption on the consolidated statements of income 
not consolidating the trust will not have a material impact on our reported results of operations or financial condition 
currently  the liability for the guaranteed preferred beneficial interest in our junior subordinated debentures of million is recorded on the consolidated balance sheets 
beginning in  we will report a liability of million as the total balance of the junior subordinated debentures  which corresponds to the sum of the million trust preferred securities and the million common equity of the trust 
our million equity investment in the trust will be reported in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet 
interest expense on the junior subordinated debentures will be reported in interest expense 
following fasb s issuance of fin  the federal reserve issued instructions directing bank holding companies to continue to include trust preferred securities in tier i capital until notice is given to the contrary 
there remains potential that this determination by the federal reserve may be changed at a later date

this statement would require that certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity be classified on the consolidated balance sheets as liabilities

table of contents risk factors you should read carefully and consider the following risks and uncertainties because they could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
fluctuations in interest rates could reduce our profitability 
we are subject to interest rate risk 
we realize income primarily from the difference between interest earned on loans and investments and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
we expect that we will periodically experience imbalances in the interest rate sensitivities of our assets and liabilities  meaning that either our interest earning assets will be more sensitive to changes in market interest rates than our interest bearing liabilities  or vice versa 
in either event  if market interest rates should move contrary to our position  this gap will work against us  and our earnings may be negatively affected 
in addition  loan volume and quality can be affected by market interest rates on loans 
accordingly  changes in levels of market interest rates could materially adversely affect our net interest spread  asset quality  origination volume and overall profitability 
as of december   our internal financial models indicated an exposure to our net interest income from both declining or static flat rates 
if we experienced no change in the volume and mix of our earning assets and if interest rates were to remain static  our earning asset yields would likely decline more than our liability rates  resulting in a reduced net interest margin 
significant asset growth would be required to offset the negative impact to net interest income from the decline in the margin 
our net interest income would also be under stress if rates continue to fall 
the net interest income at risk for year one in the falling rate scenario of basis points was calculated at million  or  lower than the net interest income in the rates unchanged scenario 
computation of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions  including relative levels of market interest rates  loan and security prepayments  deposit decay and pricing and reinvestment strategies and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
we principally manage interest rate risk by managing our volume and mix of financial instruments 
in a changing interest rate environment  we may not be able to manage this risk effectively 
if we are unable to manage interest rate risk effectively  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially harmed 
for more information concerning our interest rate sensitivity  see the section of this annual report captioned management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risks 
our wholesale funding sources may prove insufficient to replace deposits at maturity and support our future growth 
we must maintain sufficient funds to respond to the needs of depositors and borrowers 
as a part of our liquidity management  we use a number of funding sources in addition to core deposit growth and repayments and maturities of loans and investments 
as we continue to grow  we are likely to become more dependent on these sources  which include federal home loan bank  or fhlb  advances  brokered deposits  out of market certificates of deposit  broker dealer repurchase agreements and federal funds purchased 
at december   we had million of fhlb advances  million of brokered deposits  and million of out of market certificates of deposit outstanding 
at december   we had no broker dealer repurchase agreements 
adverse operating results or changes in industry conditions could lead to an inability to replace these additional funding sources at maturity 
our financial flexibility will be severely constrained if we are unable to maintain our access to funding or if adequate financing is not available to accommodate future growth at acceptable interest rates 
finally  if we are required to rely more heavily on more expensive funding sources to support future growth  our revenues may not increase proportionately to cover our costs 
in this case  our operating margins and profitability would be adversely affected 

table of contents our allowance for loan losses may prove to be insufficient to absorb potential losses in our loan portfolio 
like all financial institutions  we maintain an allowance for loan losses to provide for loans in our portfolio that may not repaid in their entirety 
we believe that our allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio as of the corresponding balance sheet date 
however  our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover actual loan losses  and future provisions for loan losses could materially adversely affect our operating results 
in evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses  we consider numerous quantitative factors including historical charge off experience  growth of our loan portfolio  changes in the composition of our loan portfolio and the volume of delinquent and criticized loans 
in addition  we use information about specific borrower situations  including their financial position and estimated collateral values under various liquidation scenarios to estimate the risk and amount of loss for those borrowers 
finally  we also consider many qualitative factors including general and economic business conditions  duration of the current business cycle  the impact of competition on our underwriting terms  current general market collateral valuations  trends apparent in any of the factors we take into account and other matters  which are by nature more subjective and fluid 
our estimates of the risk of loss and amount of loss on any loan is greatly complicated by the significant uncertainties surrounding our borrowers abilities to successfully execute their business models through changing economic environments  competitive challenges and other changes 
because of the degree of uncertainty and susceptibility of these factors to change  actual losses may vary from current estimates 
as a business bank  our loan portfolio is comprised primarily of commercial loans to businesses  the loans to which are inherently larger in amount than loans to individual consumers 
the individually larger commercial loans can cause greater volatility in reported credit quality performance measures  such as total impaired or nonperforming loans 
for example  our current credit risk rating and loss estimate with respect to a single sizeable loan can have a material impact on our reported impaired loans and related loss exposure estimates 
net loan charge offs totaled million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
in addition  federal and state regulators periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase our allowance for loan losses by recognizing provisions for loan losses charged to expense  or to decrease our allowance for loan losses by recognizing loan charge offs  net of recoveries 
any such provisions for loan losses or charge offs  as required by these regulatory agencies  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
if we do not successfully implement our business strategy and manage our growth effectively  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
in we began implementing a business strategy that involves an enhanced focus on commercial banking and wealth management activities 
at part of this strategy  we discontinued offering some products and services in order to deploy additional resources to our commercial banking activities 
specifically  we discontinued non customer conforming first mortgage loan originations  some fiduciary trust services and the funding of broker sourced home equity  auto and manufactured housing loans 
as our operations become less diversified  we expect the risks associated with our commercial banking activities to have a greater impact on our overall performance 
our business strategy also has involved increasing our small to middle market business customer base and expanding the range of financial products and services we offer these customers 
this growth may place a significant strain on our management  personnel  systems and resources 
in recent periods  we have increased our marketing and advertising campaigns and increased our expenditures and investments in advertising accordingly 
we cannot assure you that our increased advertising will achieve our desired objectives 
additionally  we must continue to improve our operational and financial systems and managerial controls and procedures to 
table of contents accommodate any future growth 
we cannot assure you that we will manage our growth effectively 
if we fail to do so  our business could be materially harmed 
further  unless our expansion of commercial banking and wealth management activities results in an increase in our revenues that is proportionate to the increase in our costs associated with our strategy  our operating margins and profitability will be adversely affected 
our business is subject to the vagaries of domestic and international economic conditions and other factors  many of which are beyond our control and could significantly harm our business 
our business is directly affected by domestic and international factors that are beyond our control  including economic  political and market conditions  broad trends in industry and finance  legislative and regulatory changes  competition  changes in government monetary and fiscal policies  consolidation within our customer base and within our industry and inflation 
for example  a significant decline in general economic conditions  such as recession  unemployment and other factors beyond our control  would significantly impact our business 
a deterioration in economic conditions may result in a decrease in demand for consumer and commercial credit and a decline in real estate and other asset values 
delinquencies  foreclosures and losses generally increase during economic slowdowns or recessions  and we therefore expect that our servicing costs and credit losses would increase during such periods 
our success is dependent to a significant extent upon economic conditions in the chicago metropolitan area  where virtually all of our loans are originated 
for example  our small and middle market business and commercial real estate customers in the chicago metropolitan area could be significantly affected by a local recession or economic downturn  which may result in an increase of defaults on outstanding loans and reduced demand for future loans  both of which could adversely affect us 
adverse changes in the economy of the chicago metropolitan area could also impair our ability to gather deposits and could otherwise have a negative effect on our business  including the demand for new loans  the ability of customers to repay loans and the value of the collateral securing loans 
furthermore  a substantial portion of our loan portfolio involves loans that are to some degree secured by real estate properties located primarily within the chicago metropolitan area 
in the event that real estate values in the chicago area decline  the value of this collateral would be impaired 
our business may be adversely affected by the highly regulated environment in which we operate 
we are subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision  which is primarily for the protection of depositors and customers rather than for the benefit of investors 
as a bank holding company  we are subject to regulation and supervision primarily by the federal reserve 
the bank  as an illinois chartered member bank  is subject to regulation and supervision by the illinois commissioner of banks and real estate  which we refer to as the illinois commissioner of banks  and by the federal reserve
