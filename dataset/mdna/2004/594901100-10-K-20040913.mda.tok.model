primary risks are disclosed in the company s press releases and periodic sec filings 
some of the additional risks and uncertainties include the following weakness in the hospitality and tourism industries as a result of the ever present threat of terrorist attacks and the uncertain political situation in the middle east and parts of asia  unexpected health and environmental disasters  such as the sars severe acute respiratory syndrome crisis in asia and eastern canada 
this type of crisis has a material and adverse impact on the company s business  as not only is there a material reduction in tourism for the pendency of the crises  but there is a mid term adverse impact on the buying patterns of the customers located in the affected areas 
potentially unfavorable adverse economic conditions arising from the us involvement in iraq and president bush s war on terrorism this is especially true in the hospitality and tourism industry  where geo political instability has a material adverse impact  given the adverse impact on the travel and hospitality industry as a result of the iraqi situation  micros has experienced delays in certain purchases 
there can be no guarantee that this slow down will be only short term  micros s actions in connection with the continued and increasing price and product competition in many product areas  including but not limited to eclipse pc workstations  and the pressure on profit margins for those items 
additionally  micros s introduction of the new workstation in the fourth quarter of fiscal year could adversely impact sales insofar as it will supplant in part sales of the higher priced eclipse workstation  potential declines in service margins  triggered in part by unauthorized and unlicensed service agents who offer limited support services to price conscious customers at reduced rates 
this influence also adversely impacts micros support  insofar as those customers request micros intervention to correct problems created by unauthorized third party agents 
difficulties or delays in the development  production  testing and marketing of products  including a failure to deliver new products and technologies when scheduled  announced or generally anticipated  the failure of customers to accept these products or technologies when planned  any defects in products  micros s inability to differentiate its products  and a failure of manufacturing efforts  whether internal or through micros s third party manufacturing entities

the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those that impact revenue recognition and those related to capitalized software  intangible assets  allowance for doubtful accounts  allowance for obsolescence  income taxes  contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or the services have been provided to the customer  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
in instances where the customer specifies final acceptance  revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria are met 
the company reduces revenue for estimated customer returns and allowances 
hardware revenue from hardware sales is recognized at the time of shipment 
software if a third party can install the software  revenue is recognized when shipped  with an appropriate deferral for any undelivered software contract elements 
however  if the company is the sole party that has the proprietary knowledge to install the software  revenue is recognized upon installation and when ready to go live  with an appropriate deferral for any undelivered software contract elements 
this deferral is earned when significant obligations no longer exist 
service service contract and hosting revenue is initially recorded as deferred service revenue and is recognized on a pro rata basis over the contract term 
revenue for the installation of the product  programming and the training of customers staff is recognized as the work is performed 
revenue from customer specific development work is recognized under the completed contract method 
multiple element arrangements the company enters into transactions that include multiple element arrangements  which may include any combination of hardware  software and or services 
when some elements are delivered before others in an arrangement and all of the following criteria are met  revenue for the delivered elements is recognized upon delivery of such item 
otherwise  revenue is deferred until the delivery of the last element 
vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value of undelivered elements is established  the functionality of delivered elements is not dependent on the undelivered elements  delivery of the element s represents the culmination of the earning process 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses that may result from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
these allowances are based on customer payment practices and history  inquiries  credit reports from third parties and other financial information 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
capitalized software development costs software development costs  for software products to be licensed to others  incurred before establishing technological feasibility are charged to operations and included in research and development costs 
software development costs incurred after establishing technological feasibility and purchased software costs are capitalized on a product by product basis until the product is available for general release to customers  at which time amortization begins 
annual amortization  charged to cost of sales  is the greater of the amount computed using the ratio that current gross revenues for a product bear to the total of current and anticipated future gross revenues for that product  or the straight line method over the remaining estimated economic life of the product 
long lived assets long lived assets the company periodically evaluates the recoverability of long lived assets  including intangibles  whenever events and changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable 

table of contents when indicators of impairment are present  the carrying values of the assets are evaluated in relation to the operating performance and future cash flows of the underlying business 
impairment is measured by the amount by which fair values are less than book value 
fair values are based on quoted market prices and assumptions concerning the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows and assumed discount rates  reflecting varying degrees of perceived risk 
if the company determines that any of the impairment indicators exist  and these assets are determined to be impaired  an adjustment to write down the long lived assets would be charged to income in the period such determination is made 
the company recognized impairment losses for investments of million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year intangible assets other than goodwill identified intangible assets were valued based on management s assumptions and other considerations for estimating fair values 
these intangible assets are being amortized over their respective useful lives according to the estimated present value of the net earning potential of each asset category 
the amortization expense related to intangible assets was million  million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively 
the company did not recognize any impairment losses during the last three fiscal years ended june  goodwill the company assesses whether goodwill and trademarks are impaired on an annual basis during the first quarter of its fiscal year 
upon determining the existence of goodwill and or trademark impairment  the company measures that impairment based on the amount by which the book value of goodwill and or trademarks exceeds its fair value 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by deducting the fair value of a reporting unit s identifiable assets and liabilities from the fair value of the reporting unit as a whole  as if that reporting unit had just been acquired and the purchase price were being initially allocated 
additional impairment assessments may be performed on an interim basis if the company encounters events of changes in circumstances that would indicate that  more likely than not  the book value of goodwill and or trademarks has been impaired 
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill and or trademark is highly subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis 
in estimating the fair value of the reporting units with recognized goodwill for the purposes of our annual or periodic analyses  the company makes estimates and judgments about the future cash flows of these businesses 
the cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates used to manage the underlying reporting units 
micros also considers its market capitalization adjusted for unallocated monetary assets such as cash  marketable debt securities and debt on the date the analysis is performed 
the company completed the first step of its annual impairment analysis in the first quarter of fiscal year as the estimated fair value of the us and international reporting units exceed the carrying values  the company concluded there was no impairment of goodwill or trademarks 
as of june   the net book value of goodwill and trademarks for the us and international reporting units was million and million  respectively

deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on the deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rate is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts more likely than not to be realized 
if the company determines that it will not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination is made 
foreign currency translation the financial statements of the company s non us operations are translated into us dollars for financial reporting purposes 
the assets and liabilities of non us operations whose functional currencies are not in us dollars are translated at the fiscal year end exchange rates  while revenues and expenses are translated at month end exchange rates during the fiscal year
