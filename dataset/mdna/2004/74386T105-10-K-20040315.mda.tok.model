item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general on january   provident financial services  inc the company  became the holding company for the provident bank the bank  following the completion of the conversion of the provident bank to a stock chartered bank 
the company issued an aggregate of  shares of its common stock in a subscription offering to eligible depositors 
concurrent with the conversion  the company contributed an additional  shares of its common stock and million in cash to the provident bank foundation  a charitable foundation established by the provident bank 
the company conducts business through its subsidiary  the provident bank  a community oriented bank operating full service branches in ten counties in northern and central new jersey 
on december   the company entered into an agreement and plan of merger  under which first sentinel bancorp  inc will merge into provident financial services  inc and first savings bank  the wholly owned subsidiary of first sentinel  will merge into the provident bank 
consideration will be paid to first sentinel stockholders in a combination of stock and cash valued at approximately million 
the transaction is subject to regulatory and stockholder approvals 
strategy the provident bank  established in  is the oldest bank in the state of new jersey 
the bank is a full service bank that offers a full range of retail and commercial loan and deposit products 
the bank emphasizes personal service and convenience as part of its customer relationship management strategy 
the bank s strategy is to grow profitably by reducing interest rate risk  a commitment to credit quality and expanding market share by acquiring  retaining and expanding customer relationships 
the bank has significantly increased commercial real estate  construction  multi family and commercial loans as part of our strategy to diversify the loan portfolio and reduce interest rate risk 
these types of loans generally have adjustable rates that initially are higher than residential loans and generally have a higher rate of risk 
our credit policy focuses on quality underwriting standards and close monitoring of the portfolio 
at year end  retail loans accounted for of the loan portfolio and commercial loans accounted for 
our strategy is to achieve a balanced mix in the loan portfolio of retail and commercial loans 
our customer relationship management strategy focuses on increasing core accounts and expanding customer relationships through our branch network  online banking and telephone banking touch points 
in  the provident bank acquired three branch offices with deposits from another financial institution and opened two de novo branch offices 
we continue to evaluate opportunities to increase our market share by expanding within our marketplace or in contiguous markets 
core deposits are generally a more stable  less expensive source of funds 
at december   core deposits were of total deposits 
a significant amount of capital was raised during the conversion and capital levels exceeded at year end 
management has developed capital management strategies to effectively utilize the excess capital and improve return on equity and earnings per share growth 
our capital management strategy includes the following components payment of cash dividends  stock repurchases  acquisitions and use of wholesale leverage 
the company declared and paid its first dividend in the second quarter of the company is currently targeting a cash dividend payout of to of net income 
in  stock repurchases were limited to buying stock for stock based compensation plans 
following the one year anniversary of the conversion  the board of directors has authorized a corporate stock repurchase program  under which or  shares of the company s common stock may be repurchased 
several wholesale leverage transactions were completed during the year 
the company used wholesale borrowings to purchase mortgage backed investment securities and to a lesser extent  to fund commercial real estate loans 
leverage strategies generally increase the company s interest rate risk exposure and leverage transactions are carefully monitored and measured as part of active balance sheet management 
the company s results of operations are primarily dependent upon net interest income  the difference between interest earned on our interest earning assets and the interest expense paid on our interest bearing liabilities 
changes in interest rates could have an adverse effect on net interest income  because as a general matter  our interest bearing liabilities reprice or mature more quickly than our interest earning assets 
an increase in interest rates generally would result in a decrease in our average interest rate spread and net interest income  which could have a negative effect on our profitability 
the company generates non interest income such as income from retail and business account fees  loan servicing fees  loan origination fees  income from loan or securities sales  fees from trust services and investment product sales and other fees 
the company s operating expenses primarily consist of compensation and benefit expenses  marketing and advertising expense  occupancy and equipment expense and other general and administrative expenses 
the company s results of operations are also effected by general economic conditions  changes in market interest rates  actions of regulatory agencies and government policies 
critical accounting policy the calculation of the allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting policy of the company 
the allowance for loan losses is a valuation account that reflects our evaluation of the probable incurred losses in our loan portfolio 
we maintain the allowance for loan losses through provisions for loan losses that are charged to income 
charge offs against the allowance for loan losses are taken on loans where we determine that the collection of loan principal is unlikely 
recoveries made on loans that have been charged off are credited to the allowance for loan losses 
the company s evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses includes a review of all loans on which the collectibility of principal may not be reasonably assured 
for residential mortgage and consumer loans this is determined primarily by delinquency and collateral values 
for commercial real estate and commercial loans an extensive review of financial performance  payment history and collateral values is conducted on a quarterly basis 
as part of the evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  each quarter we prepare a worksheet 
this worksheet categorizes the entire loan portfolio by certain risk characteristics such as loan type residential mortgage  commercial mortgage  construction  commercial  etc 
and loan risk rating 
when assigning a risk rating to a loan  management utilizes an internal risk rating system which is a nine point rating system 
loans deemed to be acceptable quality are rated one through four  with a rating of one established for loans with minimal risk 
loans that are deemed to be of questionable quality are rated five watch or six special mention 
loans with adverse classifications substandard  doubtful or loss are rated seven  eight or nine  respectively 
commercial mortgage  commercial and construction loans are rated individually and each lending officer is responsible for risk rating loans in his or her portfolio 
these risk ratings are then reviewed by the department manager  the chief lending officer and the credit administration department 
the risk ratings are then confirmed by the loan review department of the finance division and they are periodically reviewed by the credit committee in the credit renewal or approval process 
we believe the primary risks inherent in our portfolio are possible increases in interest rates  a decline in the economy  generally  and a decline in real estate market values 
any one or a combination of these events may adversely affect our loan portfolio resulting in increased delinquencies  loan losses and future levels of provisions 
accordingly  we have provided for loan losses at the current level to address the current risk in our loan portfolio 
we consider it important to maintain the ratio of our allowance for loan losses to total loans at an acceptable level given current economic conditions  interest rates and the composition of our portfolio 
although we believe that we have established and maintained the allowance for loan losses at adequate levels  additions may be necessary if future economic and other conditions differ substantially from the current operating environment 
although management uses the best information available  the level of the allowance for loan losses remains an estimate that is subject to significant judgment and short term change 
analysis of net interest income net interest income represents the difference between income on interest earning assets and expense on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income depends on the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the interest rates earned on such assets and paid on such liabilities 
average balance sheet 
the following table sets forth certain information for the years ended december   and for the periods indicated  the total dollar amount of interest income from average interest earning assets and the resultant yields  as well as the interest expense on average interest bearing liabilities  is expressed both in dollars and rates

the asset liability committee reviews a variety of strategies that project changes in asset or liability mix and the impact of those changes on projected net interest income and net income 
the company s strategy for liabilities has been to maintain a stable core funding base by focusing on core deposit account acquisition and increasing products and services per household 
the company focus on core deposit accounts has led to a shift in our funding base to less interest rate sensitive liabilities 
certificate of deposit accounts as a percentage of total deposits were at december  compared to at december  certificate of deposit accounts are generally short term 
as of december   of all time deposits had maturities of one year or less compared to at december  the company ability to retain maturing certificate of deposit accounts is the result of our strategy to remain competitively priced within our marketplace  typically within the upper quartile of rates offered by our competitors 
the company pricing strategy may vary depending upon our funding needs and our ability to fund operations through alternative sources  primarily by accessing our short term lines of credit with the federal home loan bank during periods of pricing dislocation 
quantitative analysis 
the company measures sensitivity to changes in interest rates through the use of balance sheet and income simulation models 
the analyses capture changes in net interest income using flat rates as a base  a most likely rate forecast and rising and declining interest rate forecasts 
the company measures changes in net interest income and net income for the forecast period  generally twelve to twenty four months  within our limits for acceptable change 
the following sets forth the result of our twelve month projected net interest income model as of december  change in interest rates in basis points rate shock net interest income amount change change dollars in thousands static the above table indicates that as of december   in the event of an immediate and sustained basis point increase in interest rates  we would experience an  or million decrease in net interest income 
in the event of a basis point decrease in interest rates  we would experience a  or million increase in net interest income 
another measure of interest rate sensitivity is to model changes in economic value of equity through the use of immediate and sustained interest rate shocks 
the following table illustrates the result of our economic value of equity model results as of december  change in interest rates present value of equity present value of equity as percent of present value of assets dollar amount dollar change percent change present value ratio percent change basis points dollars in thousands flat the above table indicates that as of december   in the event of an immediate and sustained basis point increase in interest rates  we would experience a or million reduction in the present value of equity 
if rates were to decrease basis points  we would experience a or million increase in our present value of equity 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodologies used in the above interest rate risk measurement 
modeling changes in net interest income requires the making of certain assumptions regarding prepayment and deposit decay rates  which may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates 
while we believe such assumptions to be reasonable  there can be no assurance that assumed prepayment rates and decay rates will approximate actual future loan prepayment and deposit withdrawal activity 
moreover  the net interest income table presented assumes that the composition of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and also assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities 
accordingly  although the net interest income table provides an indication of the bank s interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time  such measurement is not intended to and does not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on our net interest income and will differ from actual results
