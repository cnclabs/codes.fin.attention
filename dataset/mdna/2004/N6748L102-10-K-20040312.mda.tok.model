this discussion should be read in conjunction with forward looking statements and the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this form k 
this discussion and analysis also addresses our liquidity and financial condition and other matters 
general we are a diversified orthopedic products company offering a broad line of minimally invasive surgical  as well as non surgical  products for the spine  reconstruction and trauma market sectors 
our products are designed to address the lifelong bone and joint health needs of patients of all ages  helping them achieve a more active and mobile lifestyle 
we design  develop  manufacture  market and distribute medical equipment used principally by musculoskeletal medical specialists for orthopedic applications 
our main products are external and internal fixation devices used in fracture treatment  limb lengthening and bone reconstruction  non invasive stimulation products used to enhance the success rate of spinal fusions and to treat non union fractures  and bracing products used for ligament injury prevention  pain management and protection of surgical repair to promote faster healing 
our products also include a device for enhancing venous circulation  cold therapy  other pain management products  bone cement and devices for removal of the bone cement used to fix artificial implants  a bone substitute compound and airway management products 
we have administrative and training facilities in the united states  the united kingdom and italy and manufacturing facilities in the united states  the united kingdom  italy  mexico and the seychelles 
we directly distribute our products in the united states  the united kingdom  ireland  italy  germany  switzerland  austria  france  belgium  mexico and brazil 
in several of these and other markets  we also distribute our products through independent distributors 
our consolidated financial statements include the financial results of the company and its wholly owned and majority owned subsidiaries and entities over which we have control 
all intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation 
the equity method of accounting is used when we have significant influence over significant operating decisions but do not hold control 
under the equity method  original investments are recorded at cost and adjusted by our share of undistributed earnings or losses of these companies 
all material intercompany transactions and profits associated with the equity investees are eliminated in consolidation 
our reporting currency is the united states dollar 
all balance sheet accounts  except shareholders equity  are translated at year end exchange rates  and revenue and expense items are translated at weighted average rates of exchange prevailing during the year 
gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in other income expense 
gains and losses resulting from the translation of foreign currency financial statements are recorded in the accumulated other comprehensive income loss component of the shareholders equity 
our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows are not significantly impacted by seasonality trends 
in addition  we do not believe our operations will be significantly affected by inflation 
however  in the ordinary course of business  we are exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations 
our objective is to limit the impact of such movements on earnings and cash flows 
in order to achieve this objective  we seek to balance non dollar income and expenditures 
we do not ordinarily use derivative instruments to hedge foreign exchange exposure 
see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
during the three years ended december   we managed our operations in two geographic business units the americas and international 
the americas unit includes the united states  mexico and brazil 
the international unit covers the rest of the world plus export operations 
effective december   we acquired breg 
due to the timing of the acquisition  breg had no impact on our statement of operations for the year ended december  orthofix international nv critical accounting policies our discussion of operating results is based upon the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these statements necessarily requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
these estimates and assumptions form the basis for the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate these estimates  including those related to allowance for doubtful accounts  sales allowances and adjustments  inventories  investments  intangible assets and goodwill  income taxes  litigation and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions and believe our estimates for the carrying values of assets and liabilities are reasonable 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we have reviewed our critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors 
revenue recognition for bone growth stimulation and bracing products  prescribed by a physician  we recognize revenue when the product is placed on and accepted by the patient 
for sales to commercial customers  including hospitals and distributors  revenues are recognized at the time of shipment 
we derive a significant amount of our revenues in the united states from third party payors  including commercial insurance carriers  health maintenance organizations  preferred provider organizations and governmental payors such as medicare 
amounts paid by these third party payors are generally based on fixed or allowable reimbursement rates 
these revenues are recorded at the expected or pre authorized reimbursement rates  net of any contractual allowances or adjustments 
some billings are subject to review by such third party payors and may be subject to adjustment 
allowance for doubtful accounts and contractual allowances the process for estimating the ultimate collection of accounts receivable involves significant assumptions and judgments 
historical collection and payor reimbursement experience is an integral part of the estimation process related to reserves for doubtful accounts and the establishment of contractual allowances 
accounts receivable are analyzed on a quarterly basis to assess the adequacy of both reserves for doubtful accounts and contractual allowances 
revisions in allowances for doubtful accounts estimates are recorded as an adjustment to bad debt expense within sales and marketing expenses 
revisions to contractual allowances are recorded as an adjustment to net sales 
in the judgment of management  adequate allowances have been provided for doubtful accounts and contractual allowances 
our estimates are periodically tested against actual collection experience 
inventory allowances we write down our inventory for inventory excess and obsolescence equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
inventory is analyzed to assess the adequacy of inventory excess and obsolescence provisions 
reserves in excess and obsolescence provisions are recorded as adjustments to cost of goods sold 
if conditions or assumptions used in determining the market value change  additional inventory write down in the future may be necessary 
goodwill and other intangible assets we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective january  the ongoing impact will be that goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized  but instead tested at least annually for impairment 
as a result  we evaluate the recoverability and measure the potential impairment of our goodwill under sfas the annual impairment test requires an estimation of the fair value of the reporting unit  which involves judgment 
we performed the impairment test of goodwill as required by sfas no 
and noted no impairment issues with the carrying value of goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets as of december orthofix international nv litigation and contingent liabilities from time to time  we and our operations are parties to or targets of lawsuits  investigations  and proceedings  including product liability  personal injury  patent and intellectual property  health and safety  and employment matters  which are handled and defended in the ordinary course of business 
these lawsuits  investigations or proceedings could involve substantial amounts of claims and could also have an adverse impact on our reputation and client base 
although we maintain various liability insurance programs for liabilities that could result from such lawsuits  investigations or proceedings  we are essentially self insured for a significant portion of such liabilities 
we accrue for such claims when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
the process of analyzing  assessing and establishing reserve estimates for these types of claims involves judgment 
changes in the facts and circumstances associated with a claim could have a material impact on our results of operations and cash flows in the period that reserve estimates are revised 
we believe that present insurance coverage and reserves are sufficient to cover currently estimated exposures  but we cannot assure you that we will not incur liabilities in excess of recorded reserves 
tax matters we and each of our subsidiaries are taxed at the rates applicable within each of their respective jurisdictions 
the composite income tax rate  tax provisions  deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities will vary according to the jurisdiction in which profits arise 
further  certain of our subsidiaries sell products directly to our other subsidiaries or provide administrative  marketing and support services to our other subsidiaries 
these intercompany sales and support services involve subsidiaries operating in jurisdictions with differing tax rates 
the tax authorities in such jurisdictions may challenge our treatments under residency criteria  transfer pricing provisions  or other aspects of their respective tax laws  which could affect our composite tax rate and provisions 
revenues the following table presents certain items in our statements of operations as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated year ended december  net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing general and administrative research and development amortization of intangible assets 
litigation and settlement costs total operating income net income the following tables display net sales by geographic destination  net sales by geographic origination  net of intercompany eliminations and net sales by market sector 
we provide net sales by geographic destination and net sales by market sector for information purposes only 
we keep our books and records and account for net sales  costs and expenses in accordance with the geographic origination of our products 
orthofix international nv geographic destination year ended december  in us thousands percent of percent of total percent of total net sales total net sales net sales net sales net sales net sales americas    international    total    geographic origination year ended december  in us thousands percent of percent of total percent of total net sales total net sales net sales net sales net sales net sales americas    international    total    our revenues are generally derived from two primary sources sales of orthopedic and non orthopedic products 
orthopedic products are sold into three market sectors  spine  reconstruction and trauma 
sales of non orthopedic products include airway management  woman s care and other products 
market sector year ended december  in us thousands percent of percent of total percent of total net sales total net sales net sales net sales net sales net sales orthopedic spine    reconstruction    trauma    total orthopedic    non orthopedic    total    orthofix international nv compared to sales net sales increased to million in from million in net sales by geographic origination in the americas primarily in the united states increased to million in compared to million in the americas net sales represented and of our total net sales in and  respectively 
the increase in net sales for was due to strong growth in the united states and brazil of net sales in all orthopedic product market sectors 
this increase was slightly offset by a decrease in net sales of non orthofix products in mexico where we are discontinuing the distribution of certain non orthofix products 
net sales in international increased to million in from million in international net sales represented and of our total net sales in and  respectively 
the incremental impact of foreign exchange rates on international sales was to increase international net sales by million or approximately for  primarily as a result of a stronger euro and uk pound against the uk dollar 
net of foreign currency impact  international sales were up in all international subsidiaries except orthosonics  our bone cement removal business  with the largest increases in france and in our a v impulse business 
all of our market sectors experienced strong net sales growth in sales of spine products grew to million in from million in  with the sale of spinal stim bone growth stimulation products growing approximately in over increased sales of spinal stimulation resulted principally from an increase in the volume of stimulators sold and from the renewal of our distribution agreement with medtronic sofamor danek 
we estimate that the renewed distribution agreement had the effect of increasing sales by million in approval and introduction of bmps by medtronic sofamor danek have begun to show some market acceptance as a substitute for autograft bone in spinal fusion surgeries 
our spinal stim product is fda approved for both failed fusions and healing enhancement as an adjunct to spinal fusion surgery  most typically for multilevel or high risk patients 
in  medtronic sofamor danek group conducted clinical studies with bmps 
participation of physicians in the clinical studies had an adverse impact on our stimulation product sales growth in the second half of although product sales growth returned to historic product growth rates in  as physicians participate in further clinical studies with bmps  it could have a further adverse impact on stimulation product sales 
although bmps are considered or classified as a bone growth material  they have yet to be clinically proven to be effective in high risk patients 
our sales of reconstruction products grew to million in from million in  primarily due to sales of our a v impulse system  which grew in  as well as from sales of exfix products for reconstruction such as the sheffield ring system and several international distribution products  all of which experienced strong double digit rates of growth 
sales of trauma products grew to million in from million in sales of our physio stim bone growth stimulator for long bone non unions grew approximately in over while exfix products for trauma grew approximately 
sales of non orthopedic products  principally the laryngeal mask which we distribute in the united kingdom  ireland and italy  grew by to million in from million in gross profit our gross profit increased to million in from million in  primarily due to the increase in net sales of 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased slightly to in from in the increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was the result of a higher growth rate in higher margin bone growth stimulation product sales  including the renewal of our distribution agreement with medtronic sofamor danek  the favorable impact of additional direct distribution and continuing improvement in manufacturing efficiencies in our united states operations 
these positive impacts were partially offset by a negative foreign currency impact 
although foreign currency contributed million to our international sales growth  the year over year appreciation of the euro and the uk pound against the uk dollar increased production costs of external fixation and vascular products  which was detrimental to our gross profit and gross profit margin in those situations where we sell these products in us dollars 
sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses  which include commissions  royalties and bad debt provisions  generally increase and decrease in relation to sales 
sales and marketing expenses increased million to million in from million in  an increase of on a sales increase of 
sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to in from in the increase in reflects the negative impact of foreign currency on international operating expenses  higher orthofix international nv commissions on stimulation sales under the terms of our renewed distribution agreement with medtronic sofamor danek and additional costs to support the hiring of additional sales people and the launch of new products 
the pccp product was launched in the international market in the second quarter and on a limited basis in the united states in the third quarter 
in connection with the launch of the pccp product  we conducted a large training seminar for surgeons in verona  italy and a training seminar for us surgeons in chicago 
further we conducted training meetings for the sales force in europe and the united states 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased million to million from million in general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of net sales to in from in the increase in also reflects the negative impact of foreign currency on international operating expenses 
in addition  we incurred additional expenses associated with becoming a us sec registrant and with building administrative support in our direct sales organizations in europe and mexico 
research and development expenses research and development expenses increased million to million in from million in  an increase of  and decreased slightly as a percentage of net sales to in from in research and development decreased as a percent of net sales in as a result of a decrease in clinical study spending in our international unit 
amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets was million in compared to million in amortization of intangible assets consists principally of the amortization of patents and trademarks 
litigation and settlement costs based on an assessment of the merits of the kinetic concepts  inc kci  we incurred million in litigation costs in compared to no expense in we also incurred million of settlement cost to conclude the investigation by the office of inspector general into the appropriateness of claims made to federal health care programs for the off label use of our fda approved pulsed electronic magnetic field device  and billing and coding for its off label use 
see item legal proceedings for a description of the legal proceedings 
we expect to incur additional kci litigation costs in  but at a lower rate than they were incurred in other income expense  net other income expense  net was an expense of million in compared to an expense of million in the decrease in expense was the result of the following items i a gain on foreign exchange transactions in of million  compared with a loss in of million  resulting in a net improvement of million  and ii our share of losses in the orthorx joint venture  which totaled million in  an improvement of million from the million loss in interest income  net of interest expense  was million less in compared to and in we realized a gain of million from the sale of available for sale marketable securities 
income tax expense in and  the effective tax rate was and  respectively 
the effective tax rate in was negatively impacted by as a result of the kci litigation expenses  a majority of which was not deductible for income tax purposes 
our effective tax rate was also affected by the fact that a larger proportion of pre tax earnings was earned in the united states  a relatively higher tax jurisdiction 
net income net income for was million  or per basic share and per diluted share  compared to million  or per basic share and per diluted share  for  a decrease in net income of 
the weighted average number of basic common shares outstanding was  and  during and  respectively 
the weighted average number of diluted common shares outstanding was  and  during and  respectively 
orthofix international nv compared to sales net sales increased to million in from million in net sales increased when adjusted for the impacts of the sale of a device product line and the formation of the orthorx joint venture  which accounted for million and million in sales in  respectively 
net sales in the americas primarily the united states increased to million in compared to million in  an increase of 
the americas sales would have increased when adjusted for the impacts of the sale of a device product line and the formation of the orthorx joint venture  referenced above 
the americas net sales represented of our total net sales in both and the increase in from was largely due to strong growth in net sales of orthopedic products as well as an sales increase in mexico and a increase in brazil  which converted from distributorships to direct sales in net sales in international increased to million in from million in the primary contributors to the sales increase were increased sales of orthopedic products from the conversion of our distribution channel from distributorship to direct sales in france and germany during  increased sales of oscar products and increased sales of the non orthopedic laryngeal mask product  partially offset by a slower growth rate in sales from the a v impulse system 
we have substantial activities outside of the united states that are subject to the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates 
the impact of foreign exchange rates on sales outside of the united states was to increase net sales by million for  primarily as the result of a stronger euro and uk pound against the uk dollar 
all of our market sectors experienced growth in sales in our sales of spine products grew to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to an growth in sales of the spinal stim bone growth stimulator combined with a growth in the sales of spine bracing products 
this increase is principally the result of higher shipment volumes 
recent approval and introduction of bmps have begun to show some market acceptance as a substitute for autograft bone 
although it is classified as a bone growth material  it has yet to be clinically proven to be effective in high risk patients 
participation of physicians who prescribe spinal stimulation products in clinical studies with bmps had an adverse impact on our spinal stim sales growth in the second half of as physicians complete their participation in bmp clinical studies  we expect them to return to their historic patterns of prescribing spinal stimulation products 
stimulation products are sold almost exclusively in the united states  although we are attempting to expand distribution for stimulation products to europe and mexico 
sales of reconstruction products grew  which is primarily due to increased sales of our external  and internal fixation products used for reconstruction  increased sales of the oscar product  as well as increased sales of the a v impulse system 
the increase in sales of the a v impulse system was the result of expanded distribution outside of the united states 
in the united states  the a v impulse system is distributed by kendall healthcare products 
sales to kendall healthcare products increased just in as a result of their efforts to reduce their inventory levels through lower levels of purchasing 
sales of trauma products grew to million in from million in within trauma  sales of the physio stim bone growth stimulator for long bone non unions grew  while internal and external fixation products used for trauma applications grew in over the prior year 
sales of non orthopedic products increased to million in  from million in this increase was primarily due to growth in sales of the laryngeal mask product  which we distribute in the united kingdom  ireland and italy  offset by the loss of sales on products now sold by orthorx following the formation of the orthorx joint venture in january  which accounted for million in sales in gross profit the company s gross profit increased to million in from million in  primarily due to the increase of in net sales and increased gross profit margins 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to in from in the increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was the result of a higher growth rate in higher margin bone growth stimulation product sales  the favorable impact of additional direct distribution and continuing improvement in manufacturing efficiencies in our united states operations 
sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses  which include commissions  royalties and bad debt provisions  generally increase and decrease in relation to sales 
sales and marketing expenses increased million to million in from million in  an increase of on a sales increase of 
sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to in from in orthofix international nv in addition to commissions  royalties and bad debt provisions which are generally related to sales levels  sales expenses increased primarily as a result of adding field sales personnel to the direct sales force in the united states  the united kingdom  germany and france and as a result of converting to direct distribution from distributorships in france  germany  mexico and brazil during marketing expenses increased from additional workshops and product marketing support 
these additional costs were partially offset by the discontinuance of sales and marketing costs associated with orthorx following the formation of the orthorx joint venture at the beginning of further  international sales and marketing expenses were higher by approximately million as the result of a stronger euro and uk pound against the uk dollar 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses decreased to million from million in  a decrease of or million 
general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of net sales to in from in general and administrative expenses for and included million and million of legal costs  respectively  principally relating to legal costs associated with a request and subpoena for documents received by the company from the office of inspector general of the united states department of health and human services and the united states department of defense  partially offset by the recovery of million of legal reserves in for a description of the legal proceedings to which we are a party  see item legal proceedings 
other offsetting increases in general and administrative expenses included higher depreciation costs from capital investments  primarily in information technology of million and unmatched costs of million associated with opening direct operations in france and mexico during research and development expenses research and development expenses increased to million in from million in  an increase of or million  and decreased slightly as a percentage of net sales to in from in the increase in expenses was primarily associated with higher r d costs to support new product development and increases in study grants and clinical studies costs

as required by statement of accounting standards no 
 we ceased amortization of goodwill beginning in amortization of goodwill amounted to approximately million in see note to the consolidated financial statements 
other income expense  net other income expense  net was an expense of million in compared to an income of million in the change is due primarily to the formation of the orthorx joint venture in january in which we held a equity interest at december  the joint venture is accounted for under the equity method of accounting for investments and our share of the losses from the joint venture  million for  is included in other income expense 
the remainder of the account balance for is net interest income of million from cash balances and borrowings offset by foreign exchange losses of million primarily from currency devaluations in mexico and brazil where certain trade accounts payable are billed in us dollars

orthofix international nv liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents were million at december  compared to million at december   a decrease of million 
net cash provided by operating activities increased to million in from million in  an increase of million 
net cash provided by operating activities is comprised of net income  non cash items and changes in working capital 
net income decreased approximately million to million in  including million in after tax kci patent litigation costs and million in after tax oig settlement costs  from million in we expect to incur additional kci litigation costs in  but at a lower rate than they were incurred in the decrease in the net income effect on cash was offset by a million increase in non cash items and by a million reduction in the amount of cash used for working capital accounts 
net cash used in investing activities was million during  compared to million during during  we purchased the remaining minority interest in our uk distribution company  intavent orthofix ltd  for million  purchased an equity interest in innovative spinal technologies ist for million  increased our investment in the orthorx joint venture by million and on december  completed the acquisition of breg for million plus closing adjustments and transaction costs totaling approximately million 
in addition  we invested million in capital expenditures during net cash provided by financing activities was million in compared to a use of million in the majority of the financing activity in resulted from the completion of a senior secured term note for million obtained in conjunction with the breg transaction  slightly offset by million in fees incurred and paid to obtain the senior secured term note 
in addition  we received proceeds of million from the issuance of  shares of our common stock upon the exercise of options and warrants 
in  we purchased  shares of our common stock in the open market for million  or an average per share price of 
our board of directors has authorized the purchase of shares of our common stock up to a total of of the number of shares of our common stock issued from the exercise of options 
we also repaid million of loans and borrowings  principally on a line of credit in italy used to finance working capital which was reduced upon the sale of accounts receivable without recourse in italy to a third party 
in  we anticipate the use of cash for tangible and intangible capital expenditures will be approximately million  including million at breg  compared to million in when we acquired breg on december   one of our wholly owned subsidiaries  colgate  entered into a new senior secured bank facility with a syndicate of financial institutions to finance the transaction 
the senior secured bank facility provides for a five year amortizing term loan facility of million  the proceeds of which were used for partial payment of the purchase price of breg  and a five year revolving credit facility of million  upon which we had not drawn as of december  or as of march  the obligation has a floating interest rate of libor or prime rate plus a margin that is adjusted quarterly based on colgate s leverage ratio 
the interest rate as of december  was 
orthofix and each of colgate s direct and indirect subsidiaries  including orthofix inc and breg  have guaranteed the obligations of colgate under the senior secured bank facility 
the obligations of colgate under the senior secured bank facility and colgate s subsidiaries under their guarantees are secured by the pledge of their respective assets 
certain of our other subsidiaries have also guaranteed the obligations of colgate under the senior secured bank facility on a limited recourse basis 
in addition to scheduled debt repayments of million in  our new senior secured bank facility requires us to make mandatory prepayments with a the excess cash flow as defined in the credit agreement of colgate and its subsidiaries in an amount initially equal to of the excess annual cash flow of colgate and its subsidiaries  reducing to upon the attainment of a leverage ratio of less than or equal to to  b the net cash proceeds of any debt issuance by colgate and its subsidiaries or any equity issuance by us or colgate or any of its subsidiaries  c the net cash proceeds of asset dispositions over a minimum threshold or d unless reinvested  insurance proceeds or condemnation awards 
orthofix international nv the credit agreement contains customary negative covenants applicable to colgate and its subsidiaries  including restrictions on indebtedness  liens  dividends and mergers and sales of assets 
the credit agreement also contains certain financial covenants  including a fixed charge coverage ratio  an interest coverage ratio and a leverage ratio applicable to colgate and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis  and a leverage ratio applicable to orthofix and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis 
at december   we had outstanding borrowings of million and unused available lines of credit of million under a line of credit established in italy to finance the working capital of our italian operations 
the terms of the line of credit give us the option to borrow amounts in italy at rates determined at the time of borrowing 
we continue to search for viable acquisition candidates that expand our worldwide presence as well as additional products appropriate for current distribution channels 
an acquisition of another company or product line by us could result in our incurrence of additional debt and contingent liabilities 
we believe that current cash balances together with projected cash flows from operating activities  the unused revolving credit facility and available italian line of credit  the exercise of stock options  and our remaining available debt capacity are sufficient to cover anticipated operating capital needs and research and development costs during the next two fiscal years 
contractual obligations the following chart sets forth our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period dollars in thousands total less than to to over year years years years senior secured term loan     other borrowings operating leases      total      off balance sheet arrangements as of december  we did not have any material off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
orthofix international nv item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the ordinary course of business  we are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations and to the impact of changes in interest rates 
these fluctuations can vary sales  cost of goods  and costs of operations  the cost of financing and yields on cash and short term investments 
our foreign currency exposure results from fluctuating currency exchange rates  primarily the us dollar against the euro  uk pound  mexican peso and brazilian real 
we face cost of goods currency exposure when we produce products in foreign currencies such as the euro or uk pound and sell those products in uk dollars 
we face transactional currency exposures when foreign subsidiaries or the company itself enter into transactions  generally on an intercompany basis  denominated in currencies other than their local currency 
we also face currency exposure from translating the results of our global operations into the us dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of the period 
historically  we have not used financial derivatives to hedge against fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
based on our overall exposure for foreign currency at december   a hypothetical change in foreign currency rates would impact the company s balance sheet approximately million  net sales approximately million and net income and cash flows approximately million over a one year period 
our cash and cash equivalent balances and interest sensitive debt at december  were million and million 
based on such balances  a movement in interest rates would have a million and million effect on interest receivable and interest payable per year  respectively
