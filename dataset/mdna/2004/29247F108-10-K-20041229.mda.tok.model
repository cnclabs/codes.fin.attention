references made in this annual report on form k to en pointe technologies  en pointe  the company  we  us  or our refer to en pointe technologies  inc and its wholly owned subsidiaries  en pointe technologies sales  inc  en pointe technologies canada  inc  en pointe gov  inc formerly en pointe technologies ventures  inc  and the xyphen corporation dba contentware 
the following registered trademarks of the company are mentioned or referred to in this annual report en pointe technologies and the building blocks design 
item business general en pointe technologies  inc was originally incorporated in texas on january  and reincorporated in delaware on february  we are a national provider of information technology products hardware and software and value added services with a customer base consisting primarily of large and medium sized companies and government entities 
we use proprietary and non proprietary software and systems to drop ship information technology products to our customers through an electronically linked network of suppliers that include distributors and certain manufacturers in the united states 
this software allows us to serve as an electronic clearinghouse of computers and computer related products without many of the risks and costs associated with maintaining significant inventory 
in addition to seeking efficiencies and growth in our traditional large enterprise focused core business  we continue to devote resources to the development of our professional services infrastructure 
en pointe is represented in approximately sales and service markets throughout the united states  and maintains a value added iso certified integration operation in ontario  california 
we provide our customers with cost effective electronic commerce tools that help them to maximize their purchasing power when searching for and acquiring computer equipment and other technology products 
one of our available tools  accesspointe tm  is a uniquely powerful and flexible internet procurement system that is electronically linked to the extensive warehousing  purchasing and distribution functions of our suppliers 
accesspointe tm provides ease of use  real time accuracy  and the power to control the purchasing process  from paperless requisition creation to line item detail delivery tracking 
the direct links to our suppliers enhance our capacity to provide our customers with automated direct access to an extensive range of products at competitive prices 
business model our virtual inventory business model has been developed and enhanced over time  but since our inception in  our core concepts have remained the same 
the model s essential elements are i a low cost overhead structure resulting from the automation of many management and operating functions  ii effective electronic information systems  and iii reduced working capital requirements due to the leveraging of our virtual inventory model and our allied distributor relationships 
our highly sophisticated and customized enterprise resource planning system  sap  allows us to monitor sales  product returns  inventories  profitability 
table of contents and accounts receivable at the sales representative and customer level 
additionally  we have tightly integrated product purchasing and customer invoicing into our information systems to expedite procurement and billing 
accesspointe tm  an ebusiness platform  provides us and our customers with up to date product information and streamlines the procurement process 
the completely integrated ebusiness information technology architecture helps us maintain effective online communication links with our sales representatives  selected suppliers  and many of our customers 
accesspointe tm is provided free of charge to our customers to better enable them to execute transactions and research their orders online with us 
additionally  accesspointe tm can be licensed for a fee as a hosted or non hosted solution to complement our customers existing procurement processes 
we continue to focus on cost control in our business model and strive to maintain a low cost overhead structure through the automation of many of our management and operating functions 
the day to day customer support function is shared between a centralized staff at headquarters  back office contract workers in pakistan  and local account management to improve field response yet maintain direct access to all back office functions and senior management 
increased local coverage has fueled efforts to identify new opportunities 
we believe that time in front of customers is the top priority for all account managers  account executives  and senior management to build long lasting relationships and identify business solutions for existing and new customers 
in the third quarter of fiscal  we introduced another low cost overhead element to our business model strategy by relocating many of our back office functions to service providers in islamabad  pakistan 
these back office functions include  among others  customer support  purchasing  credit and collections  accounts payable  accounting  help desk support  information technology support and other administrative and support functions 
we contracted with two firms  taseer hadi khalid co  a pakistani member firm of kpmg  and ovex technologies private limited  to provide this support 
taseer hadi khalid co 
provides accounting and payroll support while ovex technologies private limited provides support for the other operational functions 
these two firms combined employed approximately people  as of september   dedicated to supporting en pointe technologies 
this has allowed us to increase the level of support we provide our customers while also keeping us cost competitive 
our product sales are conducted from both traditional branch offices as well as home office locations  which are located in approximately metropolitan markets in states 
our service business is offered nationally and is managed and staffed by our in house technicians using  when necessary  limited engagements of contracted third party service providers 
we believe in seeking out new markets wherever there is a business case to support the incurring of additional personnel expense or whenever specific account opportunities arise 
we have been and continued to be  since may   certified as a minority controlled company by the national minority supplier development council 
the certification is considered valuable because many large buying organizations  private enterprise accounts and state and local government agencies have supplier diversity initiatives that may require certain purchases to be made from certified minority controlled companies 
an integral component of our business model is our ability to access an extensive inventory of information technology products stocked by our suppliers through our integrated supply chain information systems that are key features of accesspointe tm 
additionally  the intelligent purchasing feature of our software allows our purchasing department to place multiple line item orders automatically from multiple sources at the lowest possible price  maximizing the fill rate and increasing the potential profitability on each order 
the data provided by our customized information system allows our sales representatives to design each customer s orders according to their particular needs 
product can be delivered directly from suppliers to the customer or processed through our configuration facility located in ontario  california 
we simplify the ordering  staging  and delivery process through supply chain management for any size order 
our configuration facility is located close to our major suppliers warehouse locations for convenient same day pick up of orders 
this provides the configuration facility with the flexibility to meet stringent service level agreements and still function economically by limiting inventory to customer ordered product 
once our configuration facility tests and loads systems with predefined customer images  systems are then shipped ready to install  saving customers money in downstream deployment costs 
just in time configuration is well supported by our 
table of contents information system that identifies which of our suppliers can supply the desired product at the best price when needed from different products offered from multiple suppliers 
in addition to providing a broad array of configuration services  including hardware configuration  software installation and custom imaging services  testing  aggregation  asset tagging and more  we also provide extensive logistics support 
our logistics offerings include all of our standard configuration offerings along with recovery of a customer s current assets  testing of those assets  inventory management  redeployment and disposal 
these services are made available to customers without regard to the source of their new purchases  we offer the ability to manage and deploy a customer s new equipment even if not purchased directly from us 
a distinct advantage of our business model is the economy achieved by the conservation of working capital through leveraging a virtual inventory model that engages the extensive warehousing  purchasing  distribution  marketing  and information technology functions of our suppliers 
since inception  we have been an innovator in using the drop shipping capabilities of our suppliers whenever product configuration is not required 
drop shipping avoids the costs and risks associated with maintaining inventory  enabling us to quickly adapt our product offerings to changing market demands 
as product proliferation has occurred  our limited inventory position has given us a competitive advantage with respect to price and availability on a broad range of products 
we believe our business model allows us to have the capacity to increase sales with minimal capital investment 
we also offer managed services that usually involve multi year desktop and server support contracts for specified periods of time 
we provide such services to several large national accounts by dedicated on site resources trained and certified to provide network operations support  installations  moves  adds  changes  desktop and server support  and break fix services 
we use a multi million dollar customer relationship management system to manage our help desk operations and track our service level performance for parts tracking  onsite arrival and call resolutions 
in  we started a sales department dedicated solely to software licensing 
highly skilled personnel were hired with the charter of providing comprehensive solutions to customers related to software procurement 
this specialized group provides value to customers by providing presales consulting  monitoring license compliance and managing software publishers relationships 
we believe that there is considerable opportunity in software licensing and with that in mind  in fiscal year we began investing in further upgrades to our software solutions for software licensing 
although we have been for several years an authorized microsoft large account reseller as well as an authorized agent for certain other software publishers  we had not fully developed the operational and system capabilities to expand sales opportunities 
in early fiscal year  recognizing that need  we began the process of enhancing the capabilities of sap and accesspointe tm to improve upon presales consulting  monitoring license compliance and managing software publishers relationships 
upon completion of the software upgrades targeted for mid  we believe that we will have a more efficient software selling process that will have noticed improvements for our customers ordering and maintenance needs 
to accomplish the software improvements  we hired additional personnel and contracted with an indian based privately held firm 
ebusiness our ebusiness offering is supported by our internet procurement system  accesspointe tm  service management tools and back office systems  each of which are integral parts of our business 
the continuing development and function of our information systems is therefore crucial to our success 
accesspointe tm allows us to integrate with other companies procurement systems and provide real time links to content  price and availability of products 
accesspointe tm electronically links our back office systems to our suppliers and customers 
the application provides direct on line access to hundreds of millions of dollars of information technology inventory  representing over  items from hundreds of manufacturers  and can be used to set up private exchanges across a range of information technology categories 
accesspointe tm is available to customers as a tool to access information and procure information technology products and services from us 

table of contents service management tools are built on a clarify platform 
this customer relationship management application allows us to manage complex projects efficiently 
not only can we control and manage our services engagements  but clarify also makes service information available to our customers via the web 
the back office is built around the highly scalable sap enterprise resource planning system that has been customized to accommodate our needs 
the system provides the kind of detailed and complex information necessary to manage a national sales organization 
managed and professional services we provide a full range of information technology life cycle services  including the following needs assessment solution design image development configuration deployment system refresh and disposal services post deployment support help desk we employ best practices to provide high quality  low cost service solutions that address client information technology infrastructure needs  from the desktop to the wide area network 
a team dedicated to sales of services complements the larger general sales staff to uncover opportunities within existing accounts and to seek new business for the three fiscal years ended in  net sales from services provided in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal  respectively  of our total net sales 
we have historically focused more on our managed services business than our professional services opportunities because managed services usually involve multi year desktop and server support contracts for specified periods of time 
these engagements typically result in relatively consistent revenue streams that enable us to make strategic long term investments to expand our service offerings and organizational infrastructure 
professional services  on the other hand  tend to require higher levels of investment without the relative predictability of managed services agreements 
we provide managed services to large national accounts by dedicated on site staff trained and certified to provide installations  moves  adds  changes  desktop and server support  and break fix services 
we do our own technical recruiting for these positions  to better control the quality of our staff and to provide timely and cost competitive alternatives suitable for the varying skill and or geographic requirements of our customers 
as an integral part of some of our managed services  we provide storage of inventory for customers at our ontario configuration and logistics center 
seven large customers accounted for approximately of our total service revenues for the fiscal year 
our enterprise help desk services are offered either on site at the customer location or through our centralized call center 
we maintain a technically trained staff that resolves problems during the initial phone call  thereby decreasing customer down time and increasing end user productivity 
this also reduces the need to dispatch technicians for on site visits  which reduces the overall costs of customer support 
included in our professional service offerings are desktop and server design  messaging  storage  wireless  broadband and other network support  and security 
with system security being of such concern  we are requiring our engineers and consultants to become security certified 
we plan that service engagements offered by us will include a security focus that will differentiate our professional services offerings from those of our competitors while we have not invested significantly in this area relative to our managed services  customer demand for these services appears to be increasing and we will respond to opportunities when we can leverage our existing infrastructure or when it complements an existing customer support agreement 

table of contents one area in which we continue to expand is in offerings to customers of return on investment consulting 
we assist customers to maximize the return on their information technology investment dollars by moving to new hardware platforms  consolidating servers and storage  and efficiently managing human resources with our expertise in active directory  a microsoft program that allows organizations to manage information about network resources and users 
we also have helped customers implement technologies that allow them to fix end users computers remotely  without having to dispatch an onsite engineer  and compute for them the savings they realize by minimizing their down time 
we use clarify  an industry leading customer relationship management system  to create and track our service calls and to manage service parts 
this system measures and reports initial response times  on site arrival times  and call closure or resolution times 
from voluminous call ticket data  this system compiles and calculates the corresponding service levels so that we can be measured against industry standards  our company objectives  and customer commitments 
this enables us to improve our processes to achieve greater levels of customer satisfaction 
products the majority of our sales are information technology products 
we currently make available to our customers an extensive selection of products at what we believe to be a competitive combination of price and availability 
we currently offer over  information technology products from hundreds of manufacturers  including international business machines corporation ibm  hewlett packard company hp  dell computer corporation dell  cisco systems  inc  fujitsu limited  apple computer  inc  com corporation  microsoft corporation microsoft  toshiba corporation  kingston technology corporation  lexmark international  inc  sony corporation  symantec corporation  avaya  inc  altiris  inc 
and nortel networks corporation 
we are also one of a limited number of microsoft certified large account resellers 
products that we offer include desktop and laptop computers  servers  monitors  memory  peripherals and accessories  operating systems  application software  consumables and supplies 
products manufactured by hp and dell accounted for approximately and  respectively  of our product sales in fiscal business processing outsourcing investment during fiscal year  we invested  for an approximate ownership interest in a privately held corporation formed in october  premier bpo  inc formerly en pointe global services  inc premier bpo  inc pbpo is a business process outsourcing company headquartered in clarksville  tennessee 
in addition  we provided pbpo with a  five year interest bearing note for working capital that we subsequently converted into series a non voting convertible preferred stock in october pbpo is considered a related party because of our equity interest in pbpo as well as the interrelationship of several of the investors with us 
one of our board members owns approximately of pbpo and also serves as its chairman of the board and chief executive officer 
in addition  the owners of ovex technologies private limited ovex  the pakistani company in islamabad that performs the operational side of our outsourcing  owns collectively approximately of pbpo 
because of the substantial investment that we made in pbpo  the related party nature of the investment  as well as other factors  when we evaluated our acquired interest in pbpo  we determined that pbpo met the tests of a variable interest entity under fin and pbpo has thus been consolidated with our financial statements since inception 
pbpo has sales representatives in nashville  new york city  dallas  northern california  and eastern pennsylvania 
at september   pbpo had ten employees in the us  in sales and marketing  in operations and in administration 
in addition  pbpo had contracted the services of workers in islamabad  pakistan  that perform data entry and accounts receivable functions for customers in the cable and medical industries 
ovex provided the contract workers to pbpo as well as the use of its facility  which is also shared concurrently with en pointe and our respective contracted workers 
in september  pbpo initiated its outsourcing services with the acquisition of its first customer 
services are provided contractually with customers accepting a stated monthly fee schedule for each dedicated contract worker that pbpo provides 
customers are then billed monthly as services are performed 
subsequent to year end  pbpo acquired five additional customers that commenced using its outsourcing services 
as sales continue to ramp up  it is anticipated that pbpo will need to increase its staff 
to accommodate pbpo s growth expectations  it has identified the health care and cable industries as business opportunities based on potential labor cost savings 
other industries of interest for outsourcing potential 
table of contents include customer care  computer resellers  software helpdesks  information technology software development and financial services 
in october  pbpo entered into another agreement to provide contract workers in new delhi  india 
competition we operate in the highly competitive sales segment of the information technology industry  and compete with a large number and variety of resellers of information technology products and services 
our competition also includes hardware and software manufacturers and national computer retailers that market directly to end users 
many of these companies compete principally on the basis of price and may have lower costs than us  allowing them to offer the same products and services for less 
many of our competitors are of equal size or smaller and sell to regional markets  or are larger  and sell nationally with substantially greater financial  technical  and marketing resources available to them 
on the services side  we compete with several large service providers  some of whom provide products and services and others who only provide services 
those that provide services only include banctec  inc  barrister global services network  inc and halifax corporation 
we also partner with service only providers in several areas including dispatch  install  move  add and change support services 
dell and gateway  inc gateway initially launched the manufacturer direct model and were successful in gaining market share 
other manufacturers eg ibm and hp have adopted a direct model to actively market products directly to customers 
this has had the effect of reducing the role of distributors and resellers  particularly in the enterprise accounts  which is a large percentage of our traditional target market 
the direct business model also infringes on some of the traditional value added reseller capabilities in the areas of multi vendor solutions  integration and image loading  and web enabled procurement processes  once again reducing the available market share 
our business model emphasizes comprehensive solution offerings with services wrapped around hardware and software products  attracting mainly enterprise organizations  government and to a lesser extent  mid market customers 
with the sales channel continuing to consolidate  absorbing those companies that combine face to face direct selling with web based models  we believe that our dual business model will survive  as it embraces both comprehensive and web based types of selling methods  allowing us to cater to various customer preferences 
we believe that we differentiate ourselves from our competitors through our ebusiness systems  services flexibility  and the scalability of our operations to meet our customers needs 
getting product to the customer the distribution of information technology products requires considerable investment in inventory  production control systems  and the development and maintenance of distribution channels 
resellers who assume these functions incur capital costs associated with the warehousing of products  including the costs of leasing warehouse space  maintaining inventory and tracking systems  and employing personnel to perform all the associated tasks 
furthermore  resellers who stock inventory risk obsolescence costs  which we believe may be significant due to the rapid product innovation that characterizes this market 
these overhead and touch costs require expenses that we believe more than offset the lower price advantages offered for purchasing at volume discounts and holding for future sale 
our business model eliminates many overhead and touch costs and substantial risks by leveraging the operational strengths of our suppliers  who have developed extensive warehousing  purchasing and distribution functions 
as a result  our continuing strategy is to limit our product inventory and the associated capital costs  allowing us to accept lower gross profit margins than many of our competitors 
by relying on the processing strengths of our suppliers  we are able to concentrate on developing our information systems and focus on more customer oriented activities researching  specifying  and delivering solutions 
after helping a customer select the most appropriate technology  our sales staff use our information systems to determine the best combination of price and availability for a wide variety of information technology products 
our ability to fill and deliver orders with a high level of speed and accuracy is a key benefit of our business model 
our sophisticated systems  which include all order processing functions  enable us to review  approve  
table of contents and electronically transmit orders to the proper supplier s within minutes of receiving them from customers 
most orders for in stock product are picked  staged  and drop shipped directly to the customer from the suppliers within hours of receipt of an order  and on the same business day for orders received by pm pacific time 
we usually electronically obtain order delivery information the day following shipment from our major suppliers 
we then use that information to produce an invoice  which is often sent to the customer electronically 
the standard delivery  based on product availability  is within two to three business days 
custom configuration usually adds a few more business days to the shipping time 
getting product from the supplier our staff has the ability to access the current inventory and availability records of our suppliers  so we can quickly determine which supplier can best fill an order at a given price 
furthermore  if any one supplier is unable to fill all of a customer s requirements  we are generally able to split the order among multiple sources 
this increases the same day fill rate  reduces back orders  and shrinks the time to complete an order 
our suppliers maintain warehouses throughout the country  and their individual stocking levels are updated and readily available through our systems 
this allows our staff to determine where the product is available for shipment  better gauging the delivery time to the customer s door 
we and our suppliers utilize various carriers  including industry giants united parcel service  inc and federal express corporation  to deliver product 
again taking advantage of a vendor s particular expertise  we integrate the carriers tracking system facility into our own systems to closely monitor shipments and provide delivery status for our customers 
this provides an audit trail for the customer to update order status  by tying the customer purchase order to an en pointe invoice and a subsequent proof of delivery 
we purchase most of our products from major distributors such as synnex corporation synnex  tech data corporation tech data  and ingram micro inc ingram micro  and directly from large manufacturers such as ibm  hp including the former compaq  dell and microsoft 
these are suppliers who have the requisite system strengths and integration capabilities that enable our automated systems to function efficiently 
we have successfully implemented our business strategy due in large part to these system synergies and to our close relationships with our suppliers 
equally significant to the success of our supplier relationships has been the volume of business we generate  as this volume has allowed us to negotiate more favorable terms with our suppliers 
see business factors which may affect future operating results we risk depending on a few distributors and manufacturers who could compete with us or limit our access to their product line 
intellectual property our ability to effectively compete in our market will depend significantly on our ability to protect our intellectual property 
we do not have patents on any of our technology  which we believe to be material to our future success 
we rely primarily on trade secrets  proprietary knowledge and confidentiality agreements to establish and protect our rights in intellectual property  and to maintain our competitive position 
there can be no assurance that others may not independently develop similar or superior intellectual property  gain access to our trade secrets or knowledge  or that any confidentiality agreements between us and our employees will provide meaningful protection for us in the event of any unauthorized use or disclosure of our proprietary information 
in september  supplyaccess  inc supplyaccess  a former affiliate of ours granted us a limited  exclusive license to use its accesspointe tm web site and content 
upon liquidation of supplyaccess in february  we were able to acquire full rights to accesspointe tm as well as the intellectual property rights to all of supplyaccess s software  copyrights  trade secrets and other proprietary technology 
we conduct our business under the trademark and service mark en pointe technologies as well as our logo  accesspointe tm and other marks 
we have been issued registrations for our en pointe technologies and building blocks marks in the united states and have pending registrations in canada  mexico and the european community 
we do not believe that our operations are dependent upon any of our trademarks or service marks 
we also sell products and provide services under various trademarks  service marks  and trade names that are the properties of others 
these owners have reserved all rights with respect to their respective trademarks  service marks  and trade names 

table of contents segment information the provisions of sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  require public companies to report financial and descriptive information about their reportable operating segments 
we identify reportable segments based on how management internally evaluates separate financial information  business activities and management responsibility 
for the years ended september   and  we operated in only one segment 
employees as of september   we employed approximately individuals including approximately sales  marketing and related support personnel  service and support personnel  warehousing  manufacturing  and logistic personnel and employees in administration and finance 
in addition  pbpo  a consolidated affiliate of ours  employed individuals  in sales and marketing  in operations  and in administration 
we believe that our ability to recruit and retain highly skilled technical and other management personnel will be critical to our ability to execute our business model and growth strategy 
none of our employees are represented by a labor union or are subject to a collective bargaining agreement 
we believe that our relations with our employees are good 
in addition to our us employees  we have contracted with two companies in islamabad  pakistan to provide back office support 
as of september   these two firms employed approximately people dedicated to supporting en pointe and our affiliate  pbpo 
approximately people provided accounting and administrative support while the remaining provided support to the customer support  purchasing  operations  help desk and information technology functions 
these individuals under contract are employees of taseer hadi khalid co  a pakistani member firm of kpmg  and ovex technologies private limited 
factors which may affect future operating results this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities exchange act of and section e of the securities exchange act of in light of the important factors that can materially affect results  including those set forth in this paragraph and below  the inclusion of forward looking information herein should not be regarded as a representation by us or any other person that our objectives or plans will be achieved  we may encounter competitive  technological  financial  economic and business challenges making it more difficult than expected to continue to sell our products and services  we may be unable to retain existing key sales  technical and management personnel  there may be other material adverse changes in the information technology industry or the economy  or in our operations or business  and any or all of these factors may affect our ability to continue our current sales rate or may result in lower sales volume than currently experienced 
certain important factors affecting the forward looking statements made herein include  but are not limited to our past downward sales trend exacerbated by a soft and spotty business economy with tight corporate capital spending budgets  our prior two years of operating losses that strained capital and borrowing resources and put us under risk of breaking loan covenants related to minimal acceptable operating levels  limited availability of alternative credit facilities  low margin business  a portion of our sales concentrated in one large customer  and future funding required to sustain our investment in pbpo and the absorption of related losses until pbpo becomes profitable  if at all 
assumptions relating to budgeting  marketing  and other management decisions are subjective in many respects and thus susceptible to interpretations and periodic revisions based on actual experience and business developments  the impact of which may cause us to alter our marketing  capital expenditure or other budgets  which may in turn affect our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
the reader is 
table of contents therefore cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements contained herein  which speak as of the date of this annual report on form k 
the reader should carefully consider the following risks 
in addition  keep in mind that the risks described below are not the only risks faced 
the risks described below are only the risks that we currently believe are material to our business 
however  additional risks not presently known  or risks that are currently believed to be immaterial  may also impair business operations 
there are risks in conducting our daily business plans and strategy for our first six years since inception  we experienced rapid growth in net sales  employees and branch offices 
beginning in fiscal year  and for the following two fiscal years  we saw net sales declines of approximately in each of the three fiscal years 
the effort to reverse the past contraction of net sales or to supplement the loss of sales with higher margin products or services has and will continue to put strains on our management  operational and financial resources 
to execute our recovery strategy  we expect to require the addition of new management personnel  including sales and technical services personnel  and the development of additional expertise by existing personnel 
our ability to manage our recovery effectively will require us to continue to implement and improve our operational  financial and sales systems at both the national and local level  to develop the skills of our managers and supervisors and to hire  train  motivate  retain and effectively manage our employees 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in such recovery  and the failure to do so could materially adversely affect our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
there are risks outside of our control of unfavorable economic conditions that could negatively impact on our revenues and profits revenue growth depends on the overall demand for information technology spending 
while economic recovery in the united states appears to be underway  there can be no assurance that the recovery will continue or that it will be sufficiently robust to compensate for the past severe contraction 
any resumption in the downturn in the united states economy may result in cutbacks by customers in the purchase of information technology products and services  postponed or canceled orders  longer sales cycles and lower average selling prices 
to the extent that a downturn resumes or increases in severity  we believe demand for our products and services  and therefore future revenues  could be further adversely impacted 
there is a risk we could lose our asset based financing line without being able to readily replace it our business requires significant capital to finance accounts receivable and  to a lesser extent  product inventories 
in order to obtain necessary working capital  we rely primarily on a line of credit that is collateralized by substantially all of our assets 
as a result  the amount of credit available to us may be adversely affected by numerous factors beyond our control  such as delays in collection or deterioration in the quality of our accounts receivable  economic trends in the information technology industry  interest rate fluctuations and the lending policies of our creditors 
any decrease or material limitation on the amount of capital available to us under our line of credit and other financing arrangements  particularly our interest free flooring  may limit our ability to fill existing sales orders or expand our sales levels and  therefore  may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
in addition  any significant increases in interest rates may increase the cost of financing for us and have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
we are dependent on the availability of accounts receivable financing on reasonable terms and at levels that are high relative to our equity base in order to maintain and increase our sales 
there can be no assurance that such financing will continue to be available to us in the future or available under terms acceptable to us 
our inability to have continuous access to such financing at reasonable costs could materially adversely impact our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
as of september   we had outstanding borrowings under our credit facility of million out of a total credit facility of million 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 

table of contents our low margins expose us to risks from minor adversities our overall gross profit percentages for the past three fiscal years ended september  were   and  respectively  with gross margin from product sales being in fiscal  in fiscal  and in fiscal  respectively 
our gross profit margins on product and software sales are low compared to many other resellers of information technology products and have continued to shrink 
given the significant levels of competition that characterize the reseller market  as well as the lower gross profit margins that we generate as a result of our reliance on purchasing information technology products from our suppliers  it is unlikely that we will be able to increase product gross profit margins appreciably in our core business of reselling information technology products 
moreover  in order to attract and retain many of our larger customers  we frequently must agree to pricing and maximum allowable mark ups that serve to limit the profitability of product sales to such customers 
accordingly  to the extent that our sales to such customers increase  our gross profit margins may be reduced  and therefore any future increases in net income will have to be derived from net sales growth  effective expansion into higher margin business segments or a reduction in operating expenses as a percentage of net sales  none of which can be assured 
furthermore  low gross profit margins increase the sensitivity of our business to increases in costs of financing  because financing costs to carry a receivable can be relatively high compared to the low dollar amount of gross profit on the sale underlying the receivable itself 
low gross profit margins also increase the sensitivity of the business to any increase in product returns and bad debt write offs  as the impact resulting from the inability to collect the full amount for products sold will be relatively high compared to the low amount of gross profit on the sale of such product 
any failure by us to maintain our gross profit margins and sales levels could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
there is risk that a large customer could be lost without being able to find a ready replacement for the year ended september   one customer  los angeles county  accounted for of our total net sales  two of our largest customers accounted for a combined of total net sales 
in the preceding fiscal year  no one customer accounted for more than of total net sales  while two our largest customers accounted for of total net sales 
in fiscal year  two of our customers accounted for of total net sales 
for the year ended september   our service sales were also highly concentrated with seven large customers accounting for of total service sales while in the prior fiscal year six large customers accounted for of total service sales 
our contracts for the provision of products or services are generally non exclusive agreements that are terminable by either party upon days notice 
either the loss of any large customer  or the failure of any large customer to pay its accounts receivable on a timely basis  or a material reduction in the amount of purchases made by any large customer could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
with our fast changing industry evolution we risk being outmoded or excluded from the distribution channel the personal computer industry is undergoing significant change 
in addition  in recent years a number of new  cost effective channels of distribution have developed in the industry  such as the internet  computer superstores  consumer electronic and office supply superstores  national direct marketers and mass merchants 
computer resellers are consolidating operations and acquiring or merging with other resellers and or direct marketers to achieve economies of scale and increased efficiency 
the current industry reconfiguration and the trend towards consolidation could cause the industry to become even more competitive  further increase pricing pressures and make it more difficult for us to maintain our operating margins or to increase or maintain the same level of net sales or gross profit 
declining prices  resulting in part from technological changes  may require us to sell a greater number of products to achieve the same level of net sales and gross profit 
such a trend could make it more difficult for us to continue to increase our net sales and earnings growth 
in addition  growth in the personal computer market has slowed 
if the growth rate of the personal computer market were to further decrease  our business  financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected 

table of contents the segment of the information technology industry in which we operate is highly competitive 
we compete with a large number and wide variety of resellers and providers of information technology products and services  including traditional personal computer retailers  computer superstores  consumer electronics and office supply superstores  mass merchandisers  corporate resellers  value added resellers  specialty retailers  distributors  franchisers  mail order and web order companies  national computer retailers  service only providers  and manufacturers that have their own direct marketing operations to end users 
many of these companies compete principally on the basis of price and may have lower costs than us  which allow them to offer the same products and services at lower prices 
many of our competitors are larger  have substantially greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources and offer a broader range of value added services than we do 
we compete with  among others  compucom systems  inc  dell  gateway  pomeroy computer resources  inc  cdw computer centers  inc  ibm  hp compaq  insight enterprises  inc  pc mall  inc  gtsi corp  zones  inc  pc connection  inc  and certain distributors 
we expect to face additional competition from new market entrants in the future 
competitive factors include price  service and support  the variety of products and value added services offered  and marketing and sales capabilities 
while we believe that we compete successfully with respect to most  if not all of these factors  there can be no assurance that we will continue to do so in the future 
the information technology industry has come to be characterized by aggressive price cutting and we expect pricing pressures will continue in the foreseeable future 
in addition  the information technology products industry is characterized by abrupt changes in technology and associated inventory and product obsolescence  rapid changes in consumer preferences  short product life cycles and evolving industry standards 
we will need to continue to provide competitive prices  superior product selection and quick delivery response time in addition to developing a core competency in performing value added services in order to remain competitive 
if we were to fail to compete favorably with respect to any of these factors  our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows would be materially and adversely affected 
see business competition 
we risk depending on a few distributors and manufacturers who could compete with us or limit our access to their product line a key element of our past success and future business strategy involves the maintaining of alliances with certain suppliers of information technology products and services  including  tech data  dell  synnex and microsoft 
these alliances enable us to make available to our customers a wide selection of products without subjecting us to many of the costs and risks associated with maintaining large amounts of inventory 
products and services purchased from four suppliers  tech data  dell  synnex and microsoft accounted for of our aggregate purchases in fiscal certain suppliers provide us with substantial incentives in the form of allowances passed through from manufacturers  discounts  credits and cooperative advertising  which incentives directly affect our operating income 
there can be no assurance that we will continue to receive such incentives in the future and any reduction in the amount of these incentives could have a material adverse 
table of contents effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
furthermore  we compete with certain suppliers for many of the same customers 
therefore  there can be no assurance that any such allied distributor will not use its position as a key supplier to pressure us from directly competing with them 
substantially all of our contracts with our suppliers are terminable by either party upon days notice or less and several contain minimum purchase volume requirements as a condition to providing discounts to us 
the termination or interruption of our relationships with any of the suppliers  modification of the terms or discontinuance of agreements with any of the suppliers  failure to meet minimum purchase volume requirements  or the failure to maintain a good working relationship with any significant new distributor of information technology products could materially adversely affect our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
see business getting product to the customer 
certain of the products we offer are subject to manufacturer allocations  which limit the number of units of such products available to the suppliers  which in turn may limit the number of units available to us for resale to our customers 
because of these limitations  there can be no assurance that we will be able to offer popular new products or product enhancements to our customers in sufficient quantity or in a timely manner to meet demand 
in order to offer the products of most manufacturers  we are required to obtain authorizations from such manufacturers to act as a reseller of such products  which authorizations may be terminated at the discretion of the suppliers 
as well  certain manufacturers provide us with substantial incentives in the form of allowances  training  financing  rebates  discounts  credits and cooperative advertising  which incentives directly affect our operating income 
there can be no assurance that we will continue to receive such incentives and authorizations in the future and any reduction in these incentives could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
there can also be no assurance that we will be able to obtain or maintain authorizations to offer products  directly or indirectly  from new or existing manufacturers 
termination of our rights to act as a reseller of the products of one or more significant manufacturers or our failure to gain sufficient access to such new products or product enhancements could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
evolution of the distribution process in the information technology industry has put pressure on gross profit margins  and has adversely affected a number of distributors of information technology products  including certain suppliers 
there can be no assurance that the continuing evolution of the information technology industry will not further adversely affect our distributors 
because our overall business strategy depends on our relationships with our suppliers  our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows would be materially adversely affected in the event that distributors in general and suppliers in particular continue to suffer adverse consequences due to ongoing changes in the information technology industry 
there has been a consolidation trend in the information technology industry  including consolidation among distributors of information technology products 
because our business model is dependent upon the availability of a number of information technology product distributors  any further consolidation would result in fewer distributors available to supply products to us  which could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
we risk losing communications with our back office operation in pakistan in the third quarter of fiscal  we began a business transformation that relocated many of our back office functions to service providers in islamabad  pakistan 
these back office functions include  among others  customer support  purchasing  credit and collections  accounts payable  accounting and other administrative and support functions 
we established both voice and data communications between our corporate headquarters in el segundo  california and pakistan 
however  there can be no assurance that these lines of communication will not be interrupted 
should we have interruptions with pakistan  any such interruption could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 

table of contents we have the risk of losing our senior management and other key personnel upon whom we depend we believe that our success has been and will continue to be dependent on the services and efforts of our existing senior management and other key personnel 
the loss of the services of one or more of any of our existing senior management and other key personnel would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
our success and plans for future growth also depend on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel in all areas of our business  including application development  sales and technical services 
competition for qualified personnel in the information technology industry is intense  and although we believe that we have thus far been successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel for our business  the inability to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future could have a material adverse effect upon our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
we risk failure to integrate acquisitions and or investments into our business that could cause future losses one element of our growth strategy may include expanding our business through strategic acquisitions and investments in complementary businesses 
during fiscal year  we invested  for an approximate ownership interest in pbpo  a privately held corporation formed in october pbpo is a business process outsourcing company headquartered in clarksville  tennessee 
in addition  we provided pbpo with a  five year interest bearing note for working capital that we converted into series a non voting preferred stock in october because pbpo is considered a variable interest entity under fin  we are required to consolidate our interest in pbpo 
there can be no assurance that we will be able provide any future funding required to sustain our investment in pbpo and that we will be able to absorb any related losses until pbpo becomes profitable  if at all 
we have not had significant acquisition or investment experience  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to successfully identify suitable acquisition or investment candidates  complete acquisitions or investments  or successfully integrate acquired businesses into our operations 
acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks  including but not limited to failure to achieve anticipated operating results  difficulties in the assimilation of the operations  services  products  vendor agreements  and personnel of the acquired company  the diversion of management s attention and other resources from other business concerns  entry into markets in which we have little or no prior experience  and the potential loss of key employees  customers  or contracts of the acquired company 
acquisition and investments could also conflict with restrictions in our agreements with existing or future lenders  distributors or manufacturers 
we are unable to predict whether or when any prospective acquisition or investment candidate will become available or the likelihood that any acquisition or investment will be completed or successfully integrated 
our failure to successfully manage any potential acquisitions or investments in complementary businesses  or pbpo s failure to make profitable business decisions while it is characterized as a variable interest entity  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
we risk business interruption from our dependence on centralized operations we believe that our success to date has been  and future results of operations will be  dependent in large part upon our ability to provide prompt and efficient service to our customers 
as a result  a substantial disruption of our day to day operations could have a material adverse effect upon our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
in addition  our success is largely dependent on the accuracy  quality and utilization of the information generated by our information systems  which are primarily based in ontario and el segundo  california 
repairs  replacement  relocation or a substantial interruption in these 
table of contents systems or in our telephone or data communications systems  servers or power could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
although we have business interruption insurance  an uninsurable loss could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
our current use of a single configuration facility in ontario  california also makes us more vulnerable to dramatic changes in freight rates than a competitor with multiple  geographically dispersed sites 
losses in excess of insurance coverage  an uninsurable loss  or change in freight rates could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
with the concentration of ownership of our stock held by a small group of directors and officers there are risks they can exert significant influence over corporate matters the directors  executive officers and principal stockholders of en pointe and their affiliates beneficially own  in the aggregate  approximately of our outstanding common stock 
as a result  these stockholders acting together will be able to exert considerable influence over the election of our directors and the outcome of most corporate actions requiring stockholder approval 
additionally  the directors and executive officers have significant influence over the policies and operations of our management and the conduct of our business 
such concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change of control of en pointe and consequently could affect the market price of our common stock 
there are risks quarterly operating results can vary from past results and become volatile and unpredictable our quarterly net sales and operating results may vary significantly as a result of a variety of factors  including the demand for information technology products and value added services  adoption of internet commerce models  introduction of new hardware and software technologies  introduction of new value added services by us and our competitors  changes in manufacturers prices or price protection policies  changes in shipping rates  disruption of warehousing or shipping channels  changes in the level of operating expenses  including costs from turnover of sales personnel  the timing of major marketing or other service projects  product supply shortages  inventory adjustments  changes in product mix  entry into new geographic markets  the timing and integration of acquisitions or investments  difficulty in managing margins  the loss of significant customer contracts  the necessity to write off a significant amount of accounts receivable or inventory  and general competitive and economic conditions 
in addition  a substantial portion of our net sales in each quarter results from orders booked in such quarter 
accordingly  we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
as has occurred in the past it is possible that in future periods  our operating results may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in such event  the market price of our common stock would likely be materially adversely affected 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents our stock tends to be volatile with large percentage price moves which can expose investors to unanticipated losses factors such as the announcement of acquisitions by us or our competitors  quarter to quarter variations in our operating results  changes in earnings estimates by analysts  governmental regulatory action  general trends and market conditions in the information technology industry  as well as other factors  may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock 
moreover  trading volumes in our common stock has been low historically and could exacerbate price fluctuations in the common stock 
further  the stock market has recently and in other periods experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations  which have particularly affected the market prices of the equity securities of many companies and which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
these broad market fluctuations may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock

if our internal controls prove to be ineffective that could negatively impact investors and cause our stock to drop changing laws  regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure  including the sarbanes oxley act of and related regulations implemented by the securities and exchange commission  or sec  and the nasdaq exchange  or nasd  are creating uncertainty for public companies  increasing legal and financial compliance costs and making some activities more time consuming 
we will be evaluating our internal controls systems to allow management to report on  and our independent auditors to attest to  our internal controls 
we will be performing the system and process evaluation and testing and any necessary remediation required to comply with the management certification and auditor attestation requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act 
as a result  we expect to incur substantial additional expenses and diversion of management s time 
while we anticipate being able to fully implement the requirements relating to internal controls and all other aspects of section by our september  deadline  we cannot be certain as to the timing of completion of our evaluation  testing and remediation actions or the impact of the same on our operations since there is presently no precedent available by which to measure compliance adequacy 
if we are not able to implement the requirements of section in a timely manner or with adequate compliance  we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud and might be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities  such as the sec or the nasd 
any such action could harm our business or investors confidence in our company  and could cause our stock price to fall 
if preferred stock is ever issued as an anti takeover measure  there is a risk that common stockholders could be adversely affected our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to determine the price  rights  preferences  qualifications  limitations and restrictions  including voting rights  of those shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders 
the rights of the holders of common stock will be subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
the issuance of preferred stock  while providing desirable flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes  could have the effect of delaying or preventing a third party from acquiring a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
further  section of the general corporation law of delaware prohibits us from engaging in certain business combinations with interested stockholders 
these provisions may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of en pointe without action by our stockholders  and therefore could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
item properties we lease approximately  square feet of office space for our headquarters in el segundo  california  under a lease expiring june  we also lease an approximately  square foot facility in ontario  california  which is primarily used for configuration and maintenance services 
this facility has been operational since july  at the time the ontario configuration facility was planned  we believed that there would be an emerging channel assembly market for resellers  such as us  of computer products 
however  instead  certain manufacturers began requiring distributors to co locate their final assembly 
table of contents operations at the manufacturer s facility instead of outsourcing final assembly at separate sites 
in reaction to the change in this emerging market  in january  our board of directors authorized us to sell and leaseback the ontario facility  while continuing the product configuration operation at that location 
the sale leaseback transaction was concluded in june and the resulting lease expires in as a result of these shifts in the industry the ontario facility has more capacity and space than usable for current configuration services 
in consequence we incurred a special charge of million associated therewith 
the charge was determined using the held for use model contained in sfas no 
in april  we subleased approximately of the facility space to an unrelated company 
currently we operate from branch offices in the following cities san francisco and irvine  california chicago  illinois  denver and boulder  colorado  draper  utah  boise  idaho  walpole  massachusetts  atlanta  georgia  portland and tigard  oregon  and issaquah  washington
