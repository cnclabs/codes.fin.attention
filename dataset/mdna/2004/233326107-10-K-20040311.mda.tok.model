the janus exchange was structured as a tax free split off in accordance with section of the internal revenue code 
the company has accounted for the transaction as a tax free reorganization based on two separate tax opinions the tax opinions concerning the transaction 
the tax opinions are not binding on the irs 
as a result  it is possible that the irs could take a position contrary to the tax opinions 
if the irs were to take such a contrary position and prevail  then dst could be required to recognize a gain on the janus exchange as if the company sold the oms shares for fair market value 
the company estimates  that under those circumstances  it would recognize a tax gain of approximately million and would incur federal and state income tax liabilities of approximately million 
the company has not made any provision in its financial statements for income taxes in connection with the possibility that the transaction may not be viewed as a tax free reorganization by the irs

instead  the original principal amount of each debenture will increase daily at a rate of per year series a and per year series b to  and  respectively  which is the full accreted principal amount payable at maturity for each  original principal amount of series a debentures and series b debentures  respectively

the purchase of the shares was financed from cash flows from operations and borrowings under the company s syndicated line of credit 
the shares purchased will be utilized for the company s stock award  employee stock purchase and stock option programs and for general corporate purposes 
at december   the company had million shares remaining to be purchased under these programs and had purchased million shares since the programs commenced 
the company s prior stock repurchase program expired on february  on february   the company s board of directors authorized a new stock repurchase plan 
the new plan allows but does not require the repurchase of up to million shares of company common stock in open market and private transactions during the period beginning march  through february  the million shares of the company s common stock received from the janus exchange were covered under a separate authorization and were not part of the company s existing authorized programs 
under terms of the company s november syndicated line of credit  which was issued in connection with the financing of the janus exchange  the million shares were retired and contractually required not to be reissued during the term of the credit facility 
this has the effect of reducing the company s authorized capital from million to million shares 
termination of employee stock option reload feature the company s stock option plan permits option holders to use company shares to exercise their options  and also contains a feature that allows for reload stock options 
the reload feature was included in stock options granted from february  through october  to encourage associates to accumulate stock ownership through periodic exercises of stock options using company shares owned 
the reload feature provided for an automatic grant of a new stock option at the then current market price for the number of company shares tendered in the exercise and the number of company shares withheld to satisfy income tax withholdings 
under its current accounting policies  the company is not required to record a compensation charge for stock option grants and automatic grants of reload stock options 
under proposed accounting rules with an expected adoption date of january  the fasb has determined that  for accounting purposes  all reload stock option grants will be treated as new grants and will therefore require a separate compensation charge for each reload grant 
this accounting treatment created an uncertainty surrounding both the timing and amount of compensation expense associated with reload stock option activity because the company would be unable to control or estimate how many reloadable stock options could be exercised in the future  or the impact on the company s financial statements of the expensing of reload options 
the compensation committee of the company s board of directors determined that it was in the best interest of the company to eliminate this uncertainty from future financial results 
the reload feature was removed from all outstanding stock options in the fourth quarter options with reload features covered approximately million shares of company stock 
the company compensated optionees who had reload stock options for the termination of the reload feature from their stock options 
the compensation was paid in one of two forms 
optionees received either cash in december  or the promise to receive a fixed number of shares of company stock in the future 
the form of compensation depended on the number of reload options held by the optionee 
the company recorded  in the fourth quarter  a pre tax charge of approximately million related to the termination of the reload feature from outstanding stock options 
no additional charges are expected in connection with the termination of the reload feature 
the charge has been reflected in costs and expenses for each of the respective segments 
the shares to be issued in the future as compensation for termination of the reload feature are treated as outstanding for purposes of calculating diluted earnings per share 
the company does not expect to include a reload feature in any stock options that may be issued in the future 
off balance sheet arrangements an off balance sheet arrangement is any transaction  agreement or other contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has made guarantees  a retained or a contingent interest in transferred assets  an obligation under derivative instruments classified as equity or any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing  liquidity  market risk or credit risk support to the company  or that engages in leasing  hedging or research and development arrangements with the company 
the company has no arrangements of the types described in the first three categories that it believes may have a material current or future effect on its financial condition  liquidity or results of operations 
certain guarantees that the company does not expect to have a material current or future effect on its financial condition  liquidity  or results of operations are disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
the company may have obligations arising out of variable interests in unconsolidated entities 
see fin discussion below related to these variable interests 
fin in december  the fasb issued the revised interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
fin was effective immediately to variable interest entities created after january  it is effective march  to variable interest entities created prior to february  fin requires the consolidation of certain types of entities in which the company absorbs a majority of another entity s expected losses  receives a majority of the other entity s expected residual returns  or both  as a result of ownership  contractual or other financial interests in the other entity 
these entities are called variable interest entities 
the principal characteristics of variable interests entities are an insufficient amount of equity to absorb the entity s expected losses  equity owners as a group are not able to make decisions about the entity s activities  or equity that does not absorb the entity s losses or receive the entity s residual returns 
variable interests are contractual  ownership or other monetary interests in an entity that change with fluctuations in the entity s net asset value 
as a result  variable interest entities can arise from items such as joint ventures  lease agreements  loan arrangements  guarantees or service contracts 
if an entity is determined to be a variable interest entity  the primary beneficiary must consolidate the entity 
the primary beneficiary is the holder of the variable interests that absorb a majority of the variable interest entity s expected losses or receive a majority of the entity s residual returns in the event no holder has a majority of the expected losses 
there is no primary beneficiary in cases where no single holder absorbs the majority of the expected losses or receives a majority of the residual returns 
the determination of the primary beneficiary is based on projected cash flows at the inception of the variable interests 
with regard to real estate  the company is the lessee in a series of operating leases covering a large portion of its kansas city based leased office facilities 
the lessors are generally joint ventures in which the company has a ownership that have been established specifically to purchase  finance and engage in leasing activities with the joint venture partners and unrelated third parties 
two of the real estate joint ventures have entered into financing arrangements with the company s wholly owned captive insurance company 
in each case  the other joint venture partner has guaranteed at least of the joint venture s borrowings million at december  from the company s captive insurance company 
the company is generally not the primary beneficiary of the joint ventures if the lease terms are consistent with market terms at the inception of the lease and do not include a residual value guarantee  fixed price purchase options or similar features that disproportionately obligate it to absorb decreases in value or entitle it to participate in increases in the value of the real estate 
however  in cases where the company may occupy greater than of the leased facility  the joint venture could be a variable interest entity 
the company had one real estate joint venture and related lease entered into subsequent to january   that qualified as a variable interest entity due to the company s occupancy of the facility and financing arrangement with the company s wholly owned captive insurance company 
the company has not consolidated the real estate joint venture upon application of fin because  notwithstanding its occupancy of the office facility  it is not the primary beneficiary based upon a cash flow analysis 
the company has not finalized analyses of real estate joint ventures entered into prior to february  however  management believes a large portion of the real estate joint ventures will be considered variable interests entities  based upon the company s occupancy 
based upon preliminary analyses  management does not believe the real estate joint ventures will need to be consolidated because the company is not the primary beneficiary of the joint ventures 
accordingly  management of the company believes that fin will not have a material effect on its financial statements for real estate joint ventures entered into prior to february  the company s maximum exposure under the real estate operating leases is the remaining lease payments  as reflected in future lease commitments in note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
with regard to operating joint ventures  the company has formed or entered into operating joint ventures to enter into or expand its presence in target markets 
the company has three significant operating joint ventures  bfds  ifds includes ifds uk  ifds canada and ifds luxembourg  and argus health systems 
each of these operating joint ventures was formed prior to february  the company has not finalized its fin analyses of these operating joint ventures  but its preliminary assessment is that none qualify as variable interests entities due to meeting the criteria for the operating joint venture exception in fin accordingly  the company believes that fin will not be material for these operating joint ventures 
new accounting standards in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
this statement establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability or an asset in some circumstances 
many of those instruments were previously classified as equity 
this statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  selected provisions of sfas no 
applicable to mandatorily redeemable financial instruments have a delayed effective date of fiscal years beginning after december  the company closed out its only remaining forward stock purchase contract prior to this statement becoming effective 
effective july   the company adopted eitf issue no 
eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
eitf addresses accounting for multiple revenue generating activities  such as bundled service agreements  and applies to the company s non software transactions 
the effect of eitf did not have a material impact on the company s revenue recognition policy for non software transactions 
the fasb added to its agenda in march to propose an accounting standard related to equity based compensation 
this standard is expected to be effective for fiscal periods beginning after december  january  for the company 
an exposure draft is expected to be released in the first quarter of with a final standard issued in the third quarter of the accounting standard is expected to require all companies to utilize the fair value method of accounting for equity based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
companies can currently voluntarily adopt sfas no 
 using a variety of adoption methods 
the company is currently evaluating the impact of the proposed accounting standards and the adoption alternatives provided under both the current standards and the proposed standards 
the company discloses the pro forma impact of stock based compensation on its earnings in its notes to financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and requires that the liabilities associated with these costs be recorded at their fair value in the period in which the liability is incurred 
sfas no 
is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  the company believes that the continuing impact of sfas no 
will not be material 
the estimated impact of these new accounting standards reflects the company s current views 
there may be material differences between these estimates and the actual impact of these standards 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements revenue recognition  software capitalization and amortization  depreciation of fixed assets  valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill  and accounting for investments 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition the company derives over of its revenues as a result of providing processing and services under contracts 
the majority of the amount is billed on a monthly basis generally with thirty day collection terms 
revenues are recognized for monthly processing and services upon performance of the services 
in the event a portion of the company s revenues are due six months or more from the invoice date  the company accounts for the revenue as not being fixed and determinable 
in these cases  the revenue is recognized as it becomes due 
the company s standard business practice is to bill monthly for development  consulting and training services on a time and material basis 
there are exceptions  whereby certain commercial arrangements require a fixed fee for development and consulting services 
for fixed fee arrangements  the company recognizes revenue on a percentage of completion basis 
the company derives less than of its revenues from licensing products 
the company licenses its asset management products and its awd product generally to non mutual fund customers and international customers and its intelecable and affinity products to international customers 
software license revenues are recognized at the time the contract is signed  the software is delivered and no future software obligations exist 
deferral of software license revenue billed results from delayed payment provisions  disproportionate discounts between the license and other services or the inability to unbundle certain services 
the company recognizes revenues for maintenance services ratably over the contract term  after collectibility has been assured 
for all revenues  the company assesses collection based on a variety of factors  including past collection history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
the company does not request collateral from its customers 
if it is determined that collection of revenues is not reasonably assured  revenue is deferred and is recognized at the time it becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
allowances for billing adjustments are determined as revenues are recognized and are recorded as reductions in revenues 
doubtful account expense for the company is immaterial 
software capitalization and amortization the company makes substantial investments in software to enhance the functionality and facilitate the delivery of its processing and services as well as its sale of licensed products 
purchased software is recorded at cost and is amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated economic lives of three to five years 
the company also develops a large portion of its software internally 
the company is required to capitalize software development costs under two separate accounting pronouncements 
the first  sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed  applies to software that will be sold or delivered to third parties and requires capitalization of research and development costs after technological feasibility has been established and management is committed to funding the project 
the second pronouncement  statement of position sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use  requires capitalization of certain development costs after the design has been approved and management is committed to funding the project 
the capitalized software development costs are generally amortized on a straight line basis  based on an estimated economic life  which is dependent on the nature of the project 
excluding fairway  the company has assigned lives of three to five years for capitalized software development 
the company assigned an estimated economic life of ten years for capitalized fairway development costs  due to management s estimate of when the base functionality will be replaced through enhancements or upgrades 
significant management judgment is required in determining what projects and costs associated with software development will be capitalized and in assigning estimated economic lives to the completed projects 
management specifically analyzes software development projects and analyzes the percentage of completion as compared to the initial plan and subsequent forecasts  milestones achieved and the commitment to continue funding the projects 
significant changes in any of these items may result in discontinuing capitalization of development costs as well as immediately expensing previously capitalized costs 
depreciation of fixed assets the company s philosophy on personal property  specifically data processing equipment  is to own the property as opposed to leasing it where practicable 
the company believes this approach provides it better flexibility of disposing or redeploying the asset as it nears the completion of its economic life 
the company depreciates data processing equipment using accelerated depreciation methods over the following lives non mainframe equipment three years  mainframe central processing unit four years  and mainframe direct access storage devices and tape devices five years 
the company depreciates furniture and fixtures over estimated useful lives  principally three to five years  on a straight line basis 
the company depreciates leasehold improvements using the straight line method over the lesser of the term of the lease or life of the improvements 
management judgment is required in assigning economic lives to fixed assets 
management specifically analyzes fixed asset additions  remaining net book values and gain loss upon disposition of fixed assets to determine the appropriateness of assigned economic lives 
significant changes in any of these items may result in changes in the economic life assigned and the resulting depreciation expense 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill the company assesses at least annually the impairment of identifiable intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill and enterprise level goodwill or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors that are considered important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of the company s use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
when it is determined that the carrying value of intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill and enterprise level goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  the company measures any impairment based on gross cash flows 
in  sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  became effective and  as a result  the company and its unconsolidated affiliates ceased amortizing goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives and  instead  will test for impairment annually 
the company s initial impairment test upon adoption of sfas no 
and subsequent annual impairment tests indicated that there were no impairments 
the fair value of the reporting units was estimated using the expected present value of future cash flows 
accounting for investments the company has two significant types of investments investments in available for sale securities  which is comprised principally from investments in state street and computer sciences corporation  and investments in unconsolidated affiliates  which is comprised principally of bfds  ifds uk  ifds canada  argus  wall street access and certain real estate joint ventures 
the company accounts for investments in corporations  for which it owns less than and does not have significant influence  in accordance with sfas no 
under sfas no 
 the company is required to designate its equity investments as trading or available for sale 
at december   the company had approximately billion of available for sale securities 
available for sale securities are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and recorded net of deferred taxes directly to stockholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income 
at december   the company s available for sale securities had gross unrealized holding gains of million and gross unrealized holding losses of million 
the impact of a change in fair value of these investments would be approximately million to comprehensive income 
the company records an investment impairment charge for an investment with a gross unrealized holding loss resulting from a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future  which could have a material effect on the company s financial position 
the equity method of accounting is used for investments in corporations in which the company or its subsidiaries have at least a voting interest and significant influence but do not control and for all investments in partnerships and similar interests in which the company does not control 
the company classifies these investments as unconsolidated affiliates 
under the equity method  the company recognizes  on an equity basis  income or losses from its pro rata share of these unconsolidated affiliates net income or loss  which changes the carrying value of the investment of the unconsolidated affiliate
