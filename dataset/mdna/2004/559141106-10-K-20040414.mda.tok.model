although the litigation was settled in april for  payable  at the time of settlement and the balance in january  the absence of the anticipated revenue stream during the first two years of the license substantially impaired the company s financial flexibility for executing its planned business redirection

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis management evaluates its estimates  including those related to the allowance for doubtful accounts and impairment of long lived assets 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form a basis for making judgments about carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  however  management believes that its estimates  including those for the above described items  are reasonable and that the actual results will not vary significantly from the estimated amounts 
the following critical accounting policies relate to the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from customers or other parties failure to make payments on trade receivables due to the company 
the estimates of this allowance is based on a number of factors  including historical experience  aging of the trade accounts receivable  specific information obtained by the company on the financial condition of customers  and specific agreements or negotiated amounts with customers 
goodwill  intangible assets and long lived assets the company evaluates the carrying value of its long lived assets  consisting primarily of identifiable intangible assets  and property  plant and equipment  whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
such events or circumstances include  but are not limited to  a significant decline in the company s market value  significant reductions in projected future cash flows or gross margins  or macroeconomic factors including a prolonged economic downturn 
in assessing the recoverability of long lived assets  the company compares the carrying value to the undiscounted future cash flows the assets are expected to generate 
if the total of the undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the assets  the company will be required to write down such assets based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets 
fair value is generally determined by calculating the discounted future cash flows using a discount rate based upon the weighted average cost of capital 
significant judgments and assumptions are required in the forecast of future operating results used in the preparation of the estimated future cash flows  including gross profit margins  long term forecasts of the amounts and timing of overall market growth and the company s percentage of that market  groupings of assets  discount rates and terminal growth rates 
in addition  significant estimates and assumptions are required in the determination of the fair value of our tangible long lived assets  including replacement cost  economic obsolescence  and the value that could be realized in liquidation 
changes in these estimates could have a material adverse effect on the assessment of our long lived assets  thereby requiring the company to write down or write off long lived assets 
although the company does not now believe that its existing long lived assets will be impaired in the future  we continue to periodically evaluate our long lived assets for impairment in accordance with sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  and acknowledge it is at least possible that such evaluation might result in future adjustments for impairment 
such an impairment might adversely affect our operating results 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by sab a and b and as revised by sab  revenue recognition and statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition 
accordingly  we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
determination of criteria and are based on management s judgments regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for services rendered and products delivered and the collectibility of those fees 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
we generate revenues mainly in two ways internet based licensing and product sales 
internet revenues consist primarily of license fees that usually consist of an annual  up front fee that is initially recorded as deferred revenue 
this revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the license agreement beginning after delivery has occurred  upon customer acceptance or live date and  when we have determined that the fees from the agreement are fixed and determinable and there are no significant return or acceptance provisions 
for internet revenue arrangements in which we sell through a reseller  we do not recognize any revenue until an agreement has been finalized between the customer and our authorized reseller and the content has been delivered to the customer by our reseller 
revenue is not recognized under any circumstances  unless collectibility is deemed probable 
revenues from product sales represent the sales of analog media products and other offline products and revenues earned under certain royalty agreements 
revenues from product sales are generally recognized at the time title passes to customers  distributors or resellers 
revenues from royalty agreements are recognized as earned based upon performance or product shipment 
stock based compensation the company has elected to follow accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations in accounting for stock options and awards 
accordingly  no compensation costs for stock options is included in operating results since all awards were made at exercise prices at or above their fair value on the dates of grants 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  amending fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
this statement amends sfas no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk general the company does not hold any derivative securities or other market rate sensitive instruments 
our consolidated financial statements are prepared in us dollars  while our canadian operations are conducted in canadian currency 
the company is subject to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in the canadian dollar value of foreign currency denominated transactions 
exchange rate risks magic lantern pays a number of its content suppliers in us dollars 
therefore  fluctuations in the value of the canadian dollar against the us dollar affects gross profit as well as net income 
if the value of the canadian dollar falls against the us dollar  cost of sales will increase  reducing gross profit and net income 
conversely  if the value of the canadian dollar rises against the us dollar  gross profit and net income will increase 
based on its average annual net currency positions in and  a adverse change in average annual foreign currency exchange rates would not have been material to results reported in the consolidated financial statements for those periods 
to date  we have not sought to hedge risks associated with fluctuations in exchange rates and therefore we continue to be subject to such risks 
in the future  we may undertake such transactions 
however  any hedging techniques implemented in such regard might not be successful in eliminating or reducing the effects of currency fluctuations
