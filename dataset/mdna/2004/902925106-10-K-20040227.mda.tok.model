item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and 
table of contents capital resources 
all of our revenue equipment is pledged to secure our obligations under financing arrangements 
in addition to company owned tractors  we contract with owner operators for the use of their tractors and drivers in our operations 
at december   owner operator tractors were under contract with us 
the size of our owner operator fleet varies from time to time as market conditions require 
it is unlikely that the size of our owner operator fleet in proportion to our company owned fleet will increase significantly during revenue equipment acquisition program we pursue equipment trade intervals that economically balance our maintenance costs and expected trade values 
accordingly  due to a depressed used equipment market  we extended the useful lives and reduced the salvage values on those groups of tractors that we would have traded in under normal used tractor market conditions 
these extended lives months and reduced salvage values of original cost of equipment yielded an increased depreciation charge to pre tax earnings in of approximately  extending the lives of tractors resulted in increased maintenance costs in and we instituted an aggressive trade schedule in and have instituted an aggressive trade schedule in to reduce the average age of our tractor fleet and to resume trading most tractors within months from the date of purchase  as we did prior to as the average age of the tractor fleet decreases  maintenance costs should decrease as well 
during  we acquired new tractors and new trailers 
these acquisitions  and the disposals during the year  resulted in net increases of tractors and trailers 
during  we plan to acquire  new tractors and  new trailers 
these acquisitions and the disposals planned during that year should result in net increases of tractors and trailers 
in april  we took delivery of our first tractors with the new exhaust gas recirculation engines required by the environmental protection agency 
compliance with these regulations has increased the cost of our new tractors and could substantially reduce equipment productivity and reliability  lower fuel mileage and increase our operating expenses 
manufacturers have significantly increased new equipment prices  in part to meet new engine design requirements imposed by these regulations 
these adverse effects could increase our costs or otherwise negatively affect our business or operations 
technology we maintain a state of the art data center through the efforts of more than computer professionals 
we currently use several different computing platforms ranging from personal computers to an ibm mainframe system 
we have developed the majority of our software applications internally  including payroll  billing  dispatching  accounting and maintenance programs 
we believe that the familiarity and proficiency with the systems that have resulted from these development efforts give us the ability to meet the ever changing needs of our customers quickly and efficiently 
our computer systems are monitored hours a day by experienced computer operators 
this monitoring system has allowed us to provide system availability to our users 
the technology that we use in our business enhances the efficiency of all aspects of our operations and enables us to deliver consistently superior service to our customers 
this technology includes a qualcomm satellite based equipment tracking and driver communication system  which allows us to closely monitor the location of all of our equipment and to communicate with our drivers in real time 
this enables us to efficiently dispatch drivers in response to customers requests  to provide real time information to our customers about the status of their shipments and to provide documentation supporting our assessorial charges 
we have also implemented sophisticated software programs  such as load optimization software  which is designed to match available equipment with shipments in a way that best satisfies a number of criteria  including empty miles  the driver s available hours of service and home time needs 
we also use licensed software that assists us in planning for transfers of loaded trailers between our tractors  allowing us to further enhance efficient allocation of our equipment  improve customer service and take full advantage of our drivers available hours of service 
this software also improves our ability to get drivers home on a more regular basis 
our other licensed software programs include a sophisticated route planning software program 
we also employ a variety of computing hardware and an assortment of other software programs  many of which were developed internally  that provide management the tools necessary to make fact based business decisions  salespersons the sales tools necessary to make successful presentations to customers and managers the tools necessary to control costs 

table of contents insurance and claims the primary risks for which we obtain insurance are cargo loss and damage  personal injury  property damage and workers compensation claims 
we self insure for a portion of claims exposure in each of these areas 
we are not currently insured for terrorist acts because we believe the potential risk does not justify the cost of the available coverage 
we reevaluate all our coverage decisions on an annual basis 
beginning october   our self insurance retention levels were  for workers compensation claims per occurrence and  for cargo loss and damage claims per occurrence 
for bodily injury and property damage claims  our self insurance retention level on that date was million per occurrence 
we are also responsible for the first  of damages  in the aggregate  above our self insured retention levels for bodily injury and property damage claims 
we are completely self insured for physical damage to our tractors and trailers  except that we carry catastrophic physical damage coverage to protect against natural disasters 
for medical benefits  we self insure up to  per claim per year with an aggregate claim exposure limit determined by our year to date claims experience and our number of covered lives 
we maintain insurance above the amounts for which we self insure  to certain limits  with licensed insurance carriers 
we have excess general  auto and employer s liability coverage in amounts substantially exceeding minimum legal requirements  and we believe this coverage is sufficient to protect us against catastrophic loss 
insurance carriers have recently raised premiums for many businesses  including trucking companies 
as a result  our insurance and claims expense could increase  or we could raise our self insured retention when our policies are renewed 
we believe that our policy of self insuring up to set limits  together with our safety and loss prevention programs  are effective means of managing insurance costs 
industry and competition the trucking industry includes both private fleets and for hire carriers 
private fleets consist of trucks owned and operated by shippers that move their own goods 
for hire carriers include both truckload and less than truckload operations 
truckload carriers dedicate an entire trailer to one customer from origin to destination 
less than truckload carriers pick up multiple shipments from multiple shippers on a single truck and then route the goods through terminals or service centers  where freight may be transferred to other trucks with similar destinations for delivery 
truckload carriers typically transport shipments weighing more than  pounds while less than truckload carriers typically transport shipments weighing less than  pounds 
we operate primarily in the highly fragmented for hire truckload segment of the market which  according to the american trucking association  accounted for an estimated billion in the for hire segment is highly competitive and includes thousands of carriers  none of which dominates the market 
it is characterized by many small carriers having revenues of less than million per year and relatively few carriers with revenues exceeding million per year 
measured by annual revenue  the ten largest dry van truckload carriers accounted for approximately billion  or approximately  of the for hire market in the industry continues to undergo consolidation 
in addition  the recent challenging economic times have caused the failure of many trucking companies and made entry into the industry more difficult 
we compete primarily with other truckload carriers  shipper owned fleets and  to a lesser extent  with railroads and less than truckload carriers 
a number of truckload carriers have greater financial resources  own more revenue equipment and carry a larger volume of freight than we do 
we also compete with truckload and less than truckload carriers for qualified drivers 
the principal means of competition in the truckload segment of the industry are service and price  with rate discounting being particularly intense during economic downturns 
although we compete primarily on the basis of service rather than rates  rate discounting continues to be a factor in obtaining and retaining business 
furthermore  a depressed economy tends to increase both price and service competition from alternative modes such as less than truckload carriers and railroads 
we believe that successful truckload carriers are likely to grow primarily by acquiring greater market share and  to a lesser extent  through an increase in the size of the market 
regulation usa truck is a motor carrier regulated by the us department of transportation and other federal and state agencies 
our business activities in the united states are subject to broad federal  state and local laws and regulations beyond those applicable to most business activities 
these regulated business activities include  among other things  service area  routes traveled  equipment specifications  commodities transported  rates and charges  accounting systems  financial reporting and insurance coverages 
our canadian business activities are subject to similar requirements imposed by the laws and regulations of the dominion of canada and provincial laws and regulations 

table of contents motor carrier operations are subject to safety requirements prescribed by the us department of transportation  governing interstate operation and by canadian provincial authorities 
matters such as weight and equipment dimensions are also subject to federal  state and provincial regulations 
the federal motor carrier safety administration of the us department of transportation issued a final rule on april  that made several changes to the regulations governing the hours of service for drivers of commercial motor vehicles that carry freight 
truckload carriers were required to comply with the new rules beginning on january  in general  the new rules are intended to increase safety by giving drivers more opportunity to rest and obtain restorative sleep during each work cycle by  for example  increasing the minimum off duty time during each work cycle 
moreover  under the new rules  the maximum on duty period after which a driver may no longer drive has been shortened and may no longer be extended by time spent off duty such as meal stops and other rest breaks once the on duty period has begun 
therefore  delays during a driver s on duty time such as those caused by loading unloading problems may limit drivers available hours behind the wheel  particularly if such delays occur late in an on duty period 
this  and other operational issues that the new rules may create  could increase our operating costs 
we are continuing to evaluate the new rules to determine the effect they may have on our operations 
in april  we took delivery of our first tractors with new exhaust gas recirculation egr engines 
these new engines are the product of lower emission standards established by the environmental protection agency and are required on all class eight diesel engines produced in the united states effective october  the engine technology is designed to emit cleaner emissions by recirculating exhaust gasses back through the engine instead of directly into the atmosphere 
the reliability  fuel efficiency and maintenance costs of the new engines are relatively unknown because the engines have been re engineered  have more complex components and burn at hotter temperatures 
we are subject to federal  state  provincial and local environmental laws and regulations 
we believe that we are in substantial compliance with such laws and regulations and that costs of such compliance will not have a material adverse effect on our competitive position  operations or financial condition or require a material increase in currently anticipated capital expenditures 
seasonality see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations seasonality 
forward looking statements this report contains forward looking statements and information that are based on our current beliefs and expectations and assumptions we have made based upon information currently available 
forward looking statements include statements relating to our plans  strategies  objectives  expectations  intentions and adequacy of resources  and may be identified by words such as will  could  should  may  believe  expect  intend  plan  schedule  estimate  project and similar expressions 
these statements are based on current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and change 
although we believe that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are reasonable  we cannot assure you that such expectations will be realized 
if one or more of the risks or uncertainties underlying such expectations materialize  or if underlying assumptions prove incorrect  actual results may vary materially from those expected 
among the key factors that are not within our control and that have a direct bearing on operating results are increases in fuel prices  adverse weather conditions  increased regulatory burdens and the impact of increased rate competition 
our results have also been  and will continue to be  significantly affected by fluctuations in general economic conditions  as our utilization rates are directly related to business levels of shippers in a variety of industries 
in addition  shortages of qualified drivers and intense or increased competition for drivers have adversely impacted our operating results and our ability to grow and will continue to do so 
results for any specific period could also be affected by various unforeseen events  such as unusual levels of equipment failure or vehicle accident claims 
all forward looking statements attributable to us  or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement 

table of contents we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events  or otherwise 
in light of these risks and uncertainties  the forward looking events and circumstances discussed in this report might not occur 
risk factors the following are some of the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward looking statements contained in this report and in our other filings with the securities and exchange commission 
our business is subject to general economic and business factors that are largely out of our control  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
the factors that have negatively affected us  and may do so in the future  include volatile fuel prices  excess capacity in the trucking industry  surpluses in the market for used equipment  higher interest rates  higher license and registration fees  increases in insurance premiums  higher self insurance levels  increases in accidents and adverse claims  and difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified drivers and independent contractors 
we are also affected by recessionary economic cycles and downturns in customers business cycles 
economic conditions may adversely affect our customers and their ability to pay for our services 
it is not possible to predict the effects of armed conflicts or terrorist attacks and subsequent events on the economy or on consumer confidence in the united states  or the impact  if any  on our future results of operations 

table of contents we operate in a highly competitive and fragmented industry  and our business may suffer if we are unable to adequately address downward pricing pressures and other factors that may adversely affect our ability to compete with other carriers 
numerous competitive factors could impair our ability to maintain our current profitability 
these factors include we compete with many other truckload carriers of varying sizes and  to a lesser extent  with less than truckload carriers and railroads  some of which have more equipment or greater capital resources than we do  or other competitive advantages 
some of our competitors periodically reduce their freight rates to gain business  especially during times of reduced growth rates in the economy  which may limit our ability to maintain or increase freight rates  maintain our margins or maintain significant growth in our business 
many customers reduce the number of carriers they use by selecting so called core carriers as approved service providers  and in some instances we may not be selected 
many customers periodically accept bids from multiple carriers for their shipping needs  and this process may depress freight rates or result in the loss of some of our business to competitors 
the trend toward consolidation in the trucking industry may create other large carriers with greater financial resources and other competitive advantages relating to their size with whom we may have difficulty competing 
advances in technology require increased investments to remain competitive  and our customers may not be willing to accept higher freight rates to cover the cost of these investments 
competition from internet based and other logistics and freight brokerage companies may adversely affect our customer relationships and freight rates 
economies of scale that may be passed on to smaller carriers by procurement aggregation providers may improve their ability to compete with us 
we depend heavily on the availability of fuel  and fuel shortages or increases in fuel costs or fuel taxes could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
fuel prices have fluctuated greatly and fuel taxes have generally increased in recent years 
in some periods  our operating performance was adversely affected because we were not able to fully offset the impact of higher diesel fuel prices through increased freight rates and fuel surcharges 
we do not have any long term fuel purchase contracts  and we have not entered into any other hedging arrangements  that protect us against fuel price increases 
volatile fuel prices and potential increases in fuel taxes will continue to impact us significantly 
a significant increase in fuel costs  or a shortage of diesel fuel  could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 
these costs could also exacerbate the driver shortages our industry experiences by forcing independent contractors to cease operations 
increased prices for new revenue equipment and decreases in the value of used revenue equipment may continue to adversely affect our earnings and cash flows 
in the past  we acquired new tractors and trailers at favorable prices and traded or disposed of them at prices significantly higher than today s market values 
in  there was a large supply of used tractors and trailers on the market  which has depressed the market value of used equipment to levels significantly below the values we historically received 
for this reason  we did not trade any used equipment during  which caused a significant increase in the average age of our tractors 
this extended the use of the current fleet and contributed to a significant increase in maintenance costs  negatively affected our utilization and yielded an increased depreciation charge to pre tax earnings in of approximately  although the condition of the used equipment market has improved somewhat  prices for used tractors and trailers are still significantly below historical levels 
in addition  manufacturers have recently raised the prices of new equipment significantly 
if we continue to be unable to obtain favorable prices for our used equipment  or if the cost of new equipment continues to increase  we will increase our depreciation expense or recognize less gain or a loss on the disposition of our tractors and trailers 
this has and may continue to adversely affect our earnings and cash flows 
ongoing insurance and claims expenses could significantly reduce our earnings 
we currently self insure for a portion of our claims exposure for amounts up to the first million for each bodily injury or property damage claim   for each workers compensation claim and  for each 
table of contents cargo claim 
we are also responsible for the first  in the aggregate for bodily injury or property damage claims above our self insured amounts 
we maintain insurance for liabilities above the amounts for which we self insure  to certain limits 
we completely self insure for collision damage to our own equipment 
during and  we experienced significant increases in costs associated with adverse claims 
if the number or severity of claims does not return to historical levels or increases  our operating results will be adversely affected 
in addition  the timing of the incurrence of these costs may significantly impact our operating results for a particular quarter  as compared to the comparable quarter in the prior year 
after several years of aggressive pricing  insurance carriers have begun to raise premiums for many trucking companies 
we experienced an increase of  in insurance premiums in and could experience an additional increase in our insurance costs after our current coverage expires in october if our insurance or claims expenses increase  and we are unable to offset the increase with higher freight rates  our earnings could be materially and adversely affected 
difficulty in attracting and retaining drivers could affect our profitability and ability to grow 
periodically  the transportation industry experiences increased difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified drivers  including independent contractors  resulting in intense competition for drivers 
if we are unable to continue to attract and retain drivers and contract with independent contractors  we could incur higher driver recruiting and compensation expenses or be required to let trucks sit idle  which could adversely affect our growth and profitability 
we have significant ongoing capital requirements that could affect our profitability if we are unable to generate sufficient cash from operations 
the trucking industry is very capital intensive 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash from operations in the future  we may have to limit our growth  enter into financing arrangements or operate our revenue equipment for longer periods  any of which could have a material adverse affect on our profitability 
we depend on the proper functioning and availability of our information systems 
we depend on the proper functioning and availability of our communications and data processing systems in operating our business 
our information systems are protected through physical and software safeguards 
however  they are still vulnerable to fire  storm  flood  power loss  telecommunications failures  physical or software break ins and similar events 
we do not have a catastrophic disaster recovery plan or a fully redundant backup system to protect against a loss of the data on any of our computer systems 
if any of our critical information systems fail or become otherwise unavailable  we would have to perform the functions manually  which could temporarily impact our ability to manage our fleet efficiently  to respond to customers requests effectively  to maintain billing and other records reliably and to bill for services accurately or in a timely manner 
our business interruption insurance may be inadequate to protect us in the event of a catastrophe 
any system failure  security breach or other damage could interrupt or delay our operations  damage our reputation and cause us to lose customers 
new regulations regarding drivers hours of service could materially and adversely affect our operating efficiency and increase costs 
the federal motor carrier safety administration of the us department of transportation issued a final rule on april  that made several changes to the regulations governing hours of service for drivers of commercial motor vehicles that carry freight 
truckload carriers were required to comply with the new rules beginning on january  in general  the new rules are intended to increase safety by giving drivers more opportunity to rest and sleep during each work cycle by  for example  increasing the minimum off duty time during each work cycle 
moreover  under the new rules  the maximum on duty period after which a driver may no longer drive has been shortened and may no longer be extended by time spent off duty such as meal stops and other rest breaks once the on duty period has begun 
therefore  delays during a driver s on duty time such as those caused by loading and unloading may limit the driver s available hours behind the wheel 
shippers may be unable or unwilling to assist us in managing our drivers on duty time or to pay higher rates to compensate for our costs of complying with these regulations 
this  and other operational issues that the new rules may create  could increase our operating costs 

table of contents the engines used in our newer tractors are subject to new emissions control regulations  which may substantially increase our operating expenses 
the environmental protection agency recently adopted new emissions control regulations  which require progressive reductions through in exhaust emissions from diesel engines manufactured on or after october  compliance with these regulations has increased the cost of our new tractors and could substantially reduce equipment productivity and reliability  lower fuel mileage and increase our operating expenses 
manufacturers have significantly increased new equipment prices  in part to meet new engine design requirements imposed by these regulations 
these adverse effects could increase our costs or otherwise negatively affect our business or operations 
we depend on our major customers  the loss of one or more of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
a significant portion of our revenue is generated from our major customers 
for  our top five customers accounted for approximately of our revenue  our top customers accounted for approximately of our revenue and our largest customer accounted for approximately of our revenue 
generally  we do not have long term contracts with our major customers and we cannot assure you that our customer relationships will continue as presently in effect 
a reduction in or termination of our services by one or more of our major customers could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
seasonality and the impact of weather can affect our profitability 
our tractor productivity generally decreases during the winter season because inclement weather impedes operations and some shippers reduce their shipments 
at the same time  operating expenses generally increase  with fuel efficiency declining because of engine idling and harsh weather creating higher accident frequency  increased claims and more equipment repairs 
if we are unable to retain our key executives  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be harmed 
we are dependent upon the services of robert m 
powell  our chief executive officer  and jerry d 
orler  our president 
we do not maintain key man life insurance on either of these executives 
the loss of their services could have a material adverse effect on our operations and future profitability 
we must continue to develop and retain a core group of managers if we are to realize our goal of expanding our operations and continuing our growth 
we operate in a highly regulated industry and increased costs of compliance with  or liability for violation of  existing or future regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business 
the us department of transportation and various state agencies exercise broad powers over our business  generally governing such activities as authorization to engage in motor carrier operations  safety  insurance requirements and financial reporting 
we may also become subject to new or more restrictive regulations relating to fuel emissions  drivers hours in service and ergonomics 
our canadian business activities are subject to similar requirements imposed by the laws and regulations of the dominion of canada and provincial laws and regulations 
compliance with such regulations could substantially reduce equipment productivity and increase our operating expenses 
our company drivers and independent contractors also must comply with the safety and fitness regulations promulgated by the department of transportation  including those relating to drug and alcohol testing and hours of service 
the transportation security administration of the us department of homeland security has recently adopted regulations that will require all drivers who carry hazardous materials to undergo background checks by the federal bureau of investigation 
while we have historically required all our drivers to obtain this qualification  these new regulations could reduce the availability of qualified drivers  which could require us to adjust our driver compensation package or let trucks sit idle 
these regulations could also complicate the process of matching available equipment with shipments that include hazardous materials  thereby increasing the time it takes us to respond to customer orders and our empty miles 
the transportation security administration has delayed implementation of these new regulations until april  the us department of transportation conducted a compliance review of our operations in late that revealed deficiencies in our safety and compliance program 
the department of transportation downgraded our safety rating from satisfactory to conditional on november   and our satisfactory rating was not reinstated until january   after we had taken corrective actions and the department of transportation had completed a follow up compliance review 
as a result of this temporary downgrade in our safety rating  we lost our authority to self insure for cargo loss and damage claims and for bodily injury and property damage claims from 
table of contents january  to january  during that period  we were required to obtain first dollar insurance for all amounts for which we had been self insured 
future failures to comply with department of transportation safety regulations or downgrades in our safety rating could have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial condition 
the loss of our ability to self insure for any significant period of time would materially increase our insurance costs 
in addition  we may experience difficulty in obtaining adequate levels of coverage in that event 
our operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations  the violation of which could result in substantial fines or penalties 
we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations dealing with the handling of hazardous materials and similar matters 
we operate in industrial areas where truck terminals and other industrial activities are located and where groundwater or other forms of environmental contamination could occur 
we also maintain bulk fuel storage and fuel islands at some of our facilities 
our operations involve the risks of fuel spillage or seepage  environmental damage and hazardous waste disposal  among others 
if we are involved in a spill or other accident involving hazardous substances  or if we are found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations  it could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
if we should fail to comply with applicable environmental regulations  we could be subject to substantial fines or penalties and to civil and criminal liability 
we may be unable to successfully integrate businesses we acquire into our operations 
from time to time  we consider the possibility of acquiring smaller companies as a way to expand our operations 
although we have not acquired any companies since  it is possible that we will make strategic acquisitions in the future  including acquisitions of companies that will allow us to accelerate the expansion of our third party logistics and brokerage operations 
integrating businesses we acquire may involve unanticipated delays  costs or other operational or financial problems 
successful integration of the businesses we acquire will depend on a number of factors  including our ability to transition acquired companies to our management information systems 
in integrating businesses we acquire  we may not achieve expected economies of scale or profitability or realize sufficient revenues to justify our investment 
we also face the risk that an unexpected problem at one of the companies we acquire will require substantial time and attention from senior management  diverting management s attention from other aspects of our business
