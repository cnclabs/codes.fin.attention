item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the company s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto which appear elsewhere in this annual report 
critical accounting policies the company s accounting policies are essential to understanding and interpreting the financial results reported in the consolidated financial statements 
the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements are summarized in note to those statements 
certain of those policies are considered to be particularly important to the presentation of the company s financial results because they require management to make difficult  complex or subjective judgments  often as a result of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the following is a discussion of these policies 
valuation of securities and other assets substantially all financial instruments are reflected in the consolidated financial statements at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value 
these include cash equivalents  deposits with clearing organizations  securities owned  and securities sold but not yet purchased 
where available  the company uses prices from independent sources such as listed market prices  or broker or dealer price quotations 
in addition  even where the value of a security is derived from an independent market price or broker or dealer quote  certain assumptions may be required to determine the fair value 
for instance  the company generally assumes that the size of positions in securities that the company holds would not be large enough to affect the quoted price of the securities if the company were to sell them  and that any such sale would happen in an orderly manner 
however  these assumptions may be incorrect and the actual value realized upon disposition could be different from the current carrying value 
intangible assets and goodwill goodwill represents the excess cost of a business acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired 
sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  provides that goodwill is no longer amortized and the value of identifiable intangible assets must be amortized over their useful lives  unless the asset is determined to have an indefinite useful life 
goodwill relates to the acquisitions of oppenheimer  first of michigan capital corporation  grand charter group incorporated  josephthal co 
inc and the oppenheimer division and has been allocated to the private client reporting unit pursuant to sfas no 
the company obtained an independent valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed with respect to the acquisition of the oppenheimer division in this valuation involved significant estimates  which were based on historical data  revenue projections and industry experience 
the company has identified intangible assets relating to customer relationships  which it is amortizing over their useful lives  and trademarks and trade names  which are being evaluated for impairment on at least an annual basis 
the excess cost of the oppenheimer division is being allocated to goodwill 
the company reviews its goodwill on at least an annual basis in order to determine whether its value is impaired 
goodwill is impaired when the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the reporting unit 
in estimating the fair value of the reporting unit  the company uses valuation techniques based on multiples of revenues  earnings  book value and discounted cash flows similar to models employed in analyzing the purchase price of an acquisition target 
if the value of the goodwill is impaired  the difference between the value of the goodwill reflected on the financial statements and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment occurs 
reserves the company records reserves related to legal proceedings in other payables and accrued expenses 
the determination of the amounts of these reserves requires significant judgment on the part of management 
management considers many factors including  but not limited to the amount of the claim  the amount of the loss in the client s account  the basis and validity of the claim  the possibility of wrong doing on the part of an employee of the company  previous results in similar cases  and legal precedents and case law as well as the timing of the resolution of such matters 
each legal proceeding is reviewed with counsel in each accounting period and the reserve is adjusted as deemed appropriate by management 
any change in the reserve amount is recorded as a charge to results in that period 
the assumptions of management in determining the estimates of reserves may be incorrect and the actual disposition of a legal proceeding could be greater or less than the reserve amount 
the company also records reserves or allowances for doubtful accounts related to receivables from clients and financial consultants 
client loans are collateralized by securities  however  if there is a decline in the value of the collateral and the company cannot obtain additional collateral or collect on the loan  a reserve is established 
the company also makes loans or pays advances to financial consultants 
reserves are established on these receivables if the financial consultant is no longer associated with the company and the receivable has not been promptly repaid or if it is determined that it is probable the amount will not be collected 
the company also estimates taxes payable and records income tax reserves 
these reserves are based on historic experience and may not reflect the ultimate liability 
the company monitors and adjusts these reserves as necessary 
asset management operations asset management fees are generally recognized over the period the related service is provided based on the account value at the valuation date per the respective asset management agreements 
in certain circumstances  the firm is entitled to receive incentive fees when the return on assets under management exceeds certain benchmark returns or other performance targets 
incentive fees are generally based on investment performance over a month period and are not subject to adjustment once the measurement period ends 
accordingly  incentive fees are recognized in the consolidated statements of earnings when the measurement period ends 
asset management fees and incentive fees are included in advisory fees in the consolidated statements of earnings 
assets under management are not included as assets of the company 
business environment the company is a holding company whose principal subsidiaries are oppenheimer and oam 
oppenheimer provides securities brokerage  investment banking  trust and asset management services to its clients from offices across the usa and associated offices in caracas  venezuela and buenos aires  argentina 
oppenheimer is licensed to offer brokerage and other financial services in all states 
client assets entrusted to the company as at december  totalled approximately billion 
the company provides investment advisory services through oam and fahnestock asset management  operating as a division of oppenheimer 
the company provides trust services and products through oppenheimer trust company 
at december   client assets under management by the asset management groups totaled billion 
oppenheimer also engages in proprietary trading of securities 
in addition  the company operates a discount brokerage business based in edison  nj  through freedom 
at december   the company employed approximately  people  of whom  were financial consultants 
the securities industry is highly competitive and sensitive to many factors and is directly affected by general economic and market conditions  including the volatility and price level of securities markets  the volume  size  and timing of securities transactions  the demand for investment banking services and changes in interest rates  all of which have an impact on commissions  trading and investment income as well as on liquidity 
in addition  a significant portion of the company s expenses are relatively fixed and do not vary with market activity 
consequently  substantial fluctuations can occur in the company s revenues and net income from period to period due to these and other factors 
in addition  the company faces competition from commercial banks and other sources as these institutions offer more investment banking and financial services traditionally only provided by securities firms 
the effect of the consolidation of the securities industry of recent years means that a variety of financial services companies have merged to offer a broader spectrum of investment products and such competitors have substantially greater financial resources than the company 
the company is also experiencing increasing regulation in the securities industry  particularly affecting the over the counter markets  making compliance with regulations more difficult and costly 
at present  the company is unable to predict the extent of changes  or the effect on the company s business 
outlook the company s long term plan is to continue to expand existing offices by hiring experienced professionals as well as through the purchase of operating branch offices from other broker dealers  thus maximizing the potential of each office and the development of existing trading  investment banking  investment advisory and other activities 
equally important is the search for viable acquisition candidates 
as opportunities are presented  it is the long term intention of the company to pursue growth by acquisition where a comfortable match can be found in terms of corporate goals and personnel and at a price that would provide the company s shareholders with incremental value 
in the near term  the company will not be seeking additional significant acquisitions  but will focus its attention on the integration of recent acquisitions  including the significant acquisition in of the us private client and asset management businesses of cibc world markets 
results of operations the results of the year ended december   compared to the same period of  reflect the changed face of the company after the acquisition by the company on january  of the us private client business of cibc world markets and the subsequent acquisition on june  of the us asset management business of cibc world markets together  the oppenheimer divisions 
this acquisition more than doubled the company s private client presence  adding approximately financial consultants in offices  at the date of closing 
the aggregate purchase price was approximately us million 
the company began self clearing substantially all of the private client business at the end of may until that time  cibc provided operational and administrative services to the company on a transition basis 
that arrangement precluded the attainment of certain operating efficiencies and cost savings that became available to the company post conversion of the client accounts to the company s clearing platform 
the company closed on its purchase of oam on june  oam currently manages client assets totaling over us billion 
the business includes internally managed funds  alternative investments including hedge funds and third party managed high net worth accounts 
the company s results were significantly impacted by the recent integration of its acquisition of the oppenheimer private client division and the closing of the purchase of oam 
in  expenses were impacted by payments to cibc through may for various transition services  which the company utilized during the period 
the costs of integration and retention also significantly impacted the results 
on may   oppenheimer assumed clearing and execution of the business of the oppenheimer divisions 
there were client service issues and internal operational difficulties encountered as a result of the largest conversion of client accounts in the company s history  which were largely rectified by the end of the second quarter 
the company continues to monitor its systems requirements and remains committed to make improvements in service and technology 
the assumption of the clearing functions substantially changed the company s balance sheet through increased client receivables and payables  related broker dealer stock loans and borrows and bank loans  as well as some increase in inventories carried by the company to accommodate the increased size of the business 
the company continues to believe that this recent acquisition will transform the company and the company remains confident that operating margins will improve over coming quarters as overlapping services are eliminated  and integration is completed 
the us economy has continued to pick up momentum as reflected in growth in fourth quarter gnp 
new job creation continues to lag and remains an issue for consumer confidence 
low interest rates  a record trade deficit and a record federal budget deficit have been reflected in a weak us dollar  which is trading at record lows compared to other major currencies 
these factors are likely to continue to lead to favorable us corporate earnings comparisons and continuing strength in the stock market 
savings rates and favorable demographics in the united states also provide for strong investment flows and favorable conditions for the securities industry

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management the company s principal business activities by their nature involve significant market  credit and other risks 
the company s effectiveness in managing these risks is critical to its success and stability 
as part of its normal business operations  the company engages in the trading of both fixed income and equity securities in both a proprietary and market making capacity 
the company makes markets in over the counter equities in order to facilitate order flow and accommodate its institutional and retail customers 
the company also makes markets in municipal bonds  mortgage backed securities  government bonds and high yield bonds 
market risk market risk generally means the risk of loss that may result from the potential change in the value of a financial instrument as a result of fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates and in equity and commodity prices 
market risk is inherent in all types of financial instruments  including both derivatives and non derivatives 
the company s exposure to market risk arises from its role as a financial intermediary for its customers transactions and from its proprietary trading and arbitrage activities 
see additional discussion under risk management in item 
operational risk operational risk generally means the risk of loss resulting from improper processing of transactions or deficiencies in the company s operating systems or internal controls 
with respect to its trading activities  the company has procedures designed to ensure that all transactions are accurately recorded and properly reflected on the company s books on a timely basis 
with respect to client activities  the company operates a system of internal controls designed to ensure that transactions and other account activity new account solicitation  transaction authorization  transaction processing  billing and collection are properly approved  processed  recorded and reconciled 
the company has procedures designed to assess and monitor counterparty risk 
for a discussion of funding risk  see liquidity and capital resources  above 
credit risk credit risk arises from non performance by trading counterparties  customers and issuers of debt securities held in the company s inventory 
the company manages this risk by imposing and monitoring position limits  regularly reviewing trading counterparties  monitoring and limiting securities concentrations  marking positions to market on a daily basis to evaluate and establish the adequacy of collateral  and  with respect to trading counterparties  conducting business through clearing corporations which guarantee performance 
further discussion of credit risk appears in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  in item legal and regulatory risk legal and regulatory risk includes the risk of non compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements 
the company is subject to extensive regulation in the different jurisdictions in which it conducts its activities 
the company has comprehensive procedures for addressing issues such as regulatory capital requirements  sales and trading practices  use of and safekeeping of customer funds and securities  granting of credit  collection activities  money laundering  and record keeping 
value at risk value at risk is a statistical measure of the potential loss in the fair value of a portfolio due to adverse movements in underlying risk factors 
in response to the securities and exchange commission s market risk disclosure requirements  the company has performed a value at risk analysis of its trading financial instruments and derivatives 
the value at risk calculation uses standard statistical techniques to measure the potential loss in fair value based upon a one day holding period and a confidence level 
the calculation is based upon a variance covariance methodology  which assumes a normal distribution of changes in portfolio value 
the forecasts of variances and co variances used to construct the model  for the market factors relevant to the portfolio  were generated from historical data 
although value at risk models are sophisticated tools  their use can be limited as historical data is not always an accurate predictor of future conditions 
the company attempts to manage its market exposure using other methods  including trading authorization limits and concentration limits 
at december  and  the company s value at risk for each component of market risk was as follows in thousands of us dollars fiscal as at december  high low average interest rate risk equity price risk diversification benefit total the potential future loss presented by the total value at risk generally falls within predetermined levels of loss that should not be material to the company s results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
the changes in the value at risk amounts reported in from those reported in reflect changes in the size and composition of the company s trading portfolio at december  compared to december   which include a larger position in equities 
the company s portfolio as at december  includes approximately  in corporate equities  which are co related to deferred compensation liabilities and which do not bear any value at risk to the company 
further discussion of risk management appears in item  management s discussion and analysis of the results of operations and item  risk management 
the value at risk estimate has limitations that should be considered in evaluating the company s potential future losses based on the year end portfolio positions 
recent market conditions including increased volatility  may result in statistical relationships that result in higher value at risk than would be estimated from the same portfolio under different market conditions 
likewise  the converse may be true 
critical risk management strategy involves the active management of portfolio levels to reduce market risk 
the company s market risk exposure is continuously monitored as the portfolio risks and market conditions change
