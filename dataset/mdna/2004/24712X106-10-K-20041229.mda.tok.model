item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company s total revenues declined by in fiscal  after strong growth in each of the four prior fiscal years 
the decline in fiscal was primarily due to lower equipment sales  which have decreased in each of the last three fiscal years due to a continued tight capital equipment market in the printing industry 
revenue from maintenance  spare parts and supplies decreased in fiscal because the fall off in maintenance  spare parts and supplies revenues arising from the company s legacy equipment principally the checktronic was not replaced by maintenance  spare parts and supplies revenues from new equipment installations 
the company increased its research and development expenditures to million in fiscal of net sales  primarily to enhance the speed and print quality of its new cr system 
despite the decline in revenue and increased investment in product development  the company reduced its net loss in fiscal to  compared with losses of million in fiscal and million in fiscal in february the company refinanced its borrowings  all of which were then short term  with new long term loans from new senior and subordinated lenders 
this shift in the maturity of most of these loans from short to long term increased the company s working capital 
during fiscal  the level of outstanding borrowings declined from million on september  to million on september  this million reduction in outstanding borrowings was accomplished primarily through operating cash flows  the reduction of customer receivables and increased vendor payables  partially offset by increased inventories 
the company anticipates increased revenue in fiscal from cr series and imaggia equipment sales  and believes that increases in revenues from maintenance  spare parts and supplies for this equipment will more than offset anticipated declines in maintenance  spare parts and supplies revenues from the legacy checktronic equipment 
critical accounting policies this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and assumptions  including those related to revenue recognition  inventory  allowance for doubtful accounts  income taxes and restructuring initiatives 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company s printing equipment systems are tested at the company s facility prior to shipment  and revenue related to orders shipped under standard performance conditions is recognized when systems are shipped 
systems shipped subject to non standard contractual performance conditions  such as financing approval or special print applications  are recognized as revenue upon completion or attainment of the specified condition 
service revenue is recognized as services are rendered 
for spare parts and supplies stored at customer sites  revenue is recognized when the customer uses the inventory 
amounts billed to customers under maintenance contracts are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized in income over the term of the maintenance agreement 
revenue for pre press or finishing equipment manufactured by others is recorded on a 
table of contents gross basis 
freight revenue is recorded on a gross basis and recognized upon shipment 
the related freight costs are recorded as a cost of sales 
inventory the company reduces the stated value of its inventory for obsolescence or impairment in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value  based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional reductions in stated value may be required 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company records an allowance for doubtful accounts based on identification of specific accounts receivable  supplemented by a general allowance of of accounts aged greater than days 
specific identification of doubtful accounts and determination of the amount of the required allowance involves a degree of judgment based on discussion with our customer support and sales organization  examination of the financial stability of our customers and review of their payment history 
there can be no assurance that our estimates will match actual amounts ultimately written off 
during periods of downturn in the market for printed materials or economic recession  a greater degree of risk exists concerning the ultimate collectability of accounts receivable due to the impact that these conditions might have on our customer base 
income taxes in determining the carrying value of the company s net deferred tax assets  the company must assess the likelihood of sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions  based on estimates and assumptions  to realize the benefit of these assets 
the company fully reserved its net deferred tax assets  totaling million as of september  and  recognizing that the company has incurred losses in four of the last five fiscal years and there is no assurance that future years will be profitable 
if these estimates and assumptions change in the future  the company may record a reduction in the valuation allowance  resulting in an income tax benefit in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
management evaluates the realizability of the deferred tax assets and assesses the valuation allowance quarterly 
restructuring initiatives no restructuring activities were initiated in fiscal during the three fiscal years ended september   three initiatives were completed 
see note h to the consolidated financial statements 
at the end of each quarter  management evaluates its estimates of costs to complete the restructuring initiatives 
differences  if any  between previous and revised cost estimates many result in a charge or credit to the company s results of operations 
results of operations the consolidated statements of operations for fiscal  and include the post acquisition results of the delphax business acquired by the company in december see note e to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents the following table sets forth the company s statements of operations as a percentage of net sales and should be read in connection with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto presented elsewhere in this report 
year ended september  sales maintenance  spares and supplies printing equipment net sales costs and expenses cost of sales selling  general and administrative research and development restructuring costs income loss from operations interest expense interest income realized exchange loss gain unrealized exchange gain loss loss before income taxes income tax expense net loss net sales 
the company s revenues are from sales of i maintenance  spare parts and supplies  and ii digital printing equipment 
for fiscal  revenues from maintenance  spare parts and supplies decreased from fiscal  and in fiscal increased over fiscal the dollar amounts of these revenues for fiscal  and were million  million and million  respectively 
the increase between fiscal and fiscal was due in part to acquisition of the delphax business  which contributed to fiscal results for the entire fiscal year  but to fiscal results for only about nine months 
revenues from maintenance contracts  spare parts and supplies also increased in fiscal from fiscal due to the larger installed base of imaggia and to the addition of cr series systems to the installed base 
the decrease in these revenues in fiscal  compared with fiscal  was primarily because the reduction in maintenance  spare parts and supplies revenue from the company s legacy equipment products primarily the checktronic was only partially offset by new maintenance  spare parts and supplies revenue from the company s newer equipment the cr series and imaggia systems 
sales of digital printing equipment decreased in fiscal  compared with fiscal  and decreased in fiscal  compared with fiscal in general  the company attributes these decreases to poor economic conditions for capital equipment purchases  which have led customers to decide against or postpone purchases of capital equipment for printing 
the decreases in both fiscal and fiscal were due to significantly lower sales of imaggia systems and legacy products  partially offset by improved sales of roll fed presses 
the company sold two imaggia systems in fiscal  compared with five in fiscal and in fiscal unit sales for the cr series system were four systems in fiscal  five in fiscal and two in fiscal when the first cr series system was sold 
the company anticipates increased revenue from cr series and imaggia equipment sales in fiscal  compared with fiscal 
table of contents gross margin 
the company s gross margin percentage in fiscal was  compared with and in fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in gross margin percentage for fiscal was primarily due to the sales mix  with a greater proportion of fiscal revenues derived from sale of maintenance contracts  spare parts and supplies  which typically have a higher gross margin than equipment 
the gross margin percentage benefited more in fiscal than in fiscal from the sale of equipment inventory that was acquired with the delphax business in december at values in excess of those originally assigned in the final purchase accounting for the acquisition 
the sale of this acquired inventory resulted in margins higher than the company would normally expect to achieve from its on going business 
as cited above under critical accounting policies inventory  actual future demand or market conditions for inventory may be more or less favorable than projected by management  resulting in more or less favorable margins than projected 
however  partially offsetting this favorable effect on the fiscal gross margin percentage  were the costs of consolidating the manufacturing operations in canada and discontinuing the manufacturing operations in the united states 
the increase in gross margin percentage for fiscal  compared with fiscal  was primarily due to efforts made by the company to reduce its costs to improve margins on revenues from maintenance  spare parts and supplies 
in addition  as described above  the margin for fiscal  compared with fiscal  was positively affected by the sale of inventory acquired with the delphax business in december  at values in excess of those originally assigned in the final purchase accounting for the acquisition and negatively affected by the costs of consolidating the manufacturing operations in canada and discontinuing the manufacturing operations in the united states 
in general  the company anticipates that its gross margin percentage for fiscal will be lower than for fiscal as the company expects to derive a greater proportion of fiscal revenues from the sale of equipment 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased  in fiscal  compared with fiscal  and were million higher in fiscal than in fiscal as a percentage of net sales in fiscal  and  these expenses were  and  respectively 
the decrease in the amount of these expenses in fiscal was primarily due to cost reduction efforts and lower sales volume 
the increase in fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to the acquisition of the delphax business  which added expense to fiscal for the entire year  but to fiscal for only about nine months 
bad debt expense also increased in fiscal to  compared with  in fiscal expense levels were also higher in fiscal than in fiscal as a result of an increased focus on marketing the company s products 
in addition  the strengthening of foreign currencies against the us dollar caused all expenses paid in those currencies and translated into us dollars to be significantly higher than the expenses paid in the equivalent local currencies in fiscal partially offsetting these increases was a reduction in customer support expenses as the company optimized use of in house support resources and third party support services over the course of fiscal the company anticipates that its selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal may continue to increase to support the projected growth in total revenues  but at a rate less than the projected total revenue rate of growth 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses in fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  they increased to from 
the increase was primarily due to purchased materials and components related to speed and print quality enhancements introduced in the cr research and development expenses decreased significantly in fiscal to million from million in fiscal  also decreasing as a percent of net sales to from 
in fiscal  as part of an overall restructuring of the north american activities  the research and development function  which had been split between the united states and canadian facilities  was combined in canada 
the additional expenses in canada were less than the expenses eliminated in the united states  resulting in an overall reduction in research and development costs for fiscal  compared with fiscal this reduction was partially offset by the strengthening of the canadian dollar against the us dollar  which caused expenses paid in canadian dollars and translated into us dollars to be significantly higher than equivalent canadian dollar expenses paid in fiscal interest expense 
interest expense in fiscal was  compared with  in fiscal and  in fiscal although on average the total debt outstanding in fiscal was lower than in fiscal  fiscal interest expense included  of non cash interest on the convertible subordinated notes convertible notes issued by the company in february as part of a refinancing of the company s 
table of contents debt 
the interest on the convertible notes is paid in the form of newly issued shares of company common stock  which is expensed at the average market price of the common stock over the interest period along with amortization of original issue discount 
see liquidity and capital resources and note f to the consolidated financial statement for more details on the company s debt 
interest expense for fiscal was  higher than for fiscal the interest rate in fiscal was higher than in fiscal  but applied to a lower average balance because the loan balance was paid down to million as of september   from million as of september  interest related to the credit facility was incurred throughout fiscal  but in fiscal for only the period following the december  acquisition date 
foreign exchange gains and losses 
the company incurs realized and unrealized transactional foreign exchange gains and losses on currency conversion transactions that are reflected on the company s statements of operations 
realized and unrealized transactional exchange gains and losses reflect actual and anticipated  respectively  gains or losses recognized as the result of transactions between entities with different functional currencies 
the net transactional exchange losses for fiscal and fiscal were  and  respectively 
the net transactional exchange gain for fiscal was  the company experiences translational foreign currency gains and losses  which are reflected on the company s statements of shareholders equity  with gains due to the weakening  and losses due to the strengthening  of the us dollar against the currencies of the company s foreign subsidiaries and the resulting effect of currency translation on the valuation of the intercompany accounts and certain assets of the subsidiaries  which are denominated in us dollars 
the company anticipates that it will continue to have transactional and translational foreign exchange gains or losses from foreign operations in the future  although strategies to reduce the size of the gains or losses will be reviewed and implemented whenever economical and practical 
income taxes 
for fiscal  the company recorded income tax expense of  due to applicable minimum taxes 
for fiscal  the company recorded an income tax expense of  as a result of foreign sourced income

the company fully reserved its net deferred tax assets  totaling million as of september  and  recognizing that the company has incurred losses in four of the last five fiscal years and there is no assurance that future years will be profitable 
net loss 
the company incurred a net loss of  or per share in fiscal  compared with net losses of million or per share in fiscal and million or per share in fiscal operating expenses in total were approximately  lower in fiscal than in fiscal when the company also incurred a million expense associated with the december restructuring 
in addition  the significantly lower net loss in fiscal was the result of the higher gross margin percentage for fiscal the reduction in the net loss in fiscal compared with fiscal was due to higher overall sales levels at slightly improved margins 
operating expenses were higher primarily due to the acquisition of the delphax business  which added expense to fiscal for the entire year  but to fiscal for only about nine months from the acquisition date to the end of the fiscal year 
in addition  the expense associated with the december restructuring added million to fiscal operating expenses  with the cost reductions associated with the restructuring only beginning to be realized over the course of the year 
fiscal operating expenses were also higher than for fiscal due to the effects of paying expense in foreign currencies significantly stronger against the us dollar in fiscal than in fiscal the weaker us dollar in fiscal  compared with fiscal  also resulted in net realized and unrealized losses in fiscal  compared with net realized and unrealized gains in fiscal restructuring initiatives 
no restructuring activities were initiated in fiscal since fiscal  the company has effected three restructuring initiatives for the purpose of improving operating efficiency and cost effective use of company resources 
by incurring a one time charge for each initiative  the company expected to achieve future cost savings specific to the restructuring 
however  the savings realized were not expected to be directly incremental to net income  but rather were reinvested in the company  supporting growth and product research and development 
the restructuring initiatives are summarized below 
see note h to the consolidated financial statements for more detail 

table of contents in february  the company closed its australian subsidiary and recorded a one time charge of  by closing the subsidiary  the company anticipated eliminating annual operating expenses of approximately  beginning in fiscal  with no further loss of revenues from pacific rim customers as a result of this change 
in april  the company reduced its workforce by eliminating approximately positions in the canadian subsidiary 
the cost of terminating the employees in these positions  approximately  was included in the cost of the acquisition in accordance with sfas by taking this action  the company anticipated eliminating annual operating expenses of approximately million without affecting its ability to fulfill future orders 
in december  the company announced plans to consolidate its north american manufacturing and engineering operations at its canadian subsidiary 
these operations were divided between the facilities in the united states and canada 
the company s worldwide headquarters and marketing function continued to be based in the united states 
the selling and customer support functions continued unchanged in the united states  as well as in the subsidiaries in the united kingdom and france 
the company incurred approximately million in restructuring expenses over the course of the consolidation 
these restructuring expenses were wholly comprised of employee severance costs unrelated to the acquisition of the delphax business and  therefore  were properly charged to operating expense in fiscal this action was estimated to eliminate annual operating expenses of million while improving the company s ability to provide customer service and fulfill future orders 
market risk the company has foreign subsidiaries in canada  the united kingdom and france 
the company does business in more than countries and generates approximately to of its revenues from outside north america 
the company s ability to sell its products in foreign markets may be affected by changes in economic  political or market conditions in the foreign markets in which the company does business 
the company s net investment in its foreign subsidiaries was million and million at september  and  respectively  translated into us dollars at the closing exchange rates 
the potential loss based on end of period balances and prevailing exchange rates resulting from a hypothetical strengthening of the dollar against foreign currencies was not material in the fiscal year ended september  the functional currency of the canadian subsidiary is the us dollar 
from time to time  the company has entered into foreign exchange contracts as a hedge against specific foreign currency receivables 
in fiscal and  the company did not enter into any foreign exchange contracts 
interest rate risk substantially all of the company s senior debt and the associated interest expense are sensitive to changes in the level of interest rates 
a hypothetical basis point one percentage point increase in interest rates would result in incremental interest expense in fiscal  and of approximately   and  respectively 
interest on the company s million of outstanding convertible notes is determined by dividing the monetary value of the accrued interest at a fixed rate by the initial conversion price of per common share  or  shares of common stock 
interest expense on the convertible notes is recorded quarterly based on the fair value of the  shares issued quarterly in payment of interest  measured at the average closing price of the common stock over the period 
accordingly  interest expense on the convertible notes may fluctuate from quarter to quarter but is not subject to interest rate risk 

table of contents risk related to operations the company s operations are subject to a number of risks  which include but are not limited the following limited sales of our new product lines 
acquisition of the delphax business in december significantly expanded the company s product lines to include the cr series and rs series of roll fed printing equipment 
to date  a limited number of cr series presses and rs series print system have been sold and there can be no assurance that these products can be sold in meaningful numbers in the future 
reliance on two significant customers 
the company has had two significant customers that each accounted for of revenue in fiscal the company anticipates  but cannot assure  that these customers will continue to be significant in fiscal the loss of  or a significant decrease in sales to  either of these customers could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operation 
requirements for availability of working capital 
the company depends on its revolving credit facilities for working capital 
the lender has a security interest in substantially all of the company s assets 
the company s ability to borrow under the credit facilities depends on the company maintaining a borrowing base of eligible accounts receivable and to a lesser extent eligible inventory and complying with financial covenants concerning tangible net worth  debt service coverage  interest coverage and maximum capital expenditures 
if the company is unable to generate a sufficient borrowing base and comply with the financial covenants and other requirements of the credit facilities  it will limit or prevent borrowing under the credit facilities and could have a serious adverse effect on the company 
substantial operations in foreign markets 
the company has foreign subsidiaries in canada  the united kingdom and france  does business in more than countries and generates approximately to of its revenues from outside north america 
the ability to sell products in foreign markets may be affected by changes in economic  political or market conditions in those foreign markets that are outside the company s control 
revenues are subject to fluctuations  which may be material 
the company s net sales and operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter because the sales cycle is relatively long  the size of orders may vary significantly  the availability of financing for customers in some countries is variable  customers may postpone or cancel orders  and economic  political and market conditions in some markets change with minimal notice and affect the timing and size of orders 
because the company s operating expenses are based on anticipated revenue levels and a high percentage of the operating costs are relatively fixed  variations in the timing of revenue recognition could result in significant fluctuations in operating results from period to period 
liquidity and capital resources the company entered into a credit agreement with a bank in december to finance the acquisition of the delphax business 
the remaining balance of this debt was million in february when it was refinanced 
the refinancing consisted of new three year senior secured credit facilities with a new lender under which million was borrowed at the time of the refinancing  and million in convertible subordinated notes the convertible notes accompanied by warrants to purchase company common stock 
the convertible notes have a four year maturity and bear interest at a fixed rate of per annum  which is paid by the company issuing quarterly  shares of common stock 
the number of shares issued each quarter is fixed  but the recorded interest expense for the issuance of these shares varies from quarter to quarter because it is measured at the average closing price of company common stock during the quarter 
see note f to the consolidated financial statement for more details on the company s debt 
the senior credit facilities are secured by substantially all the assets of the company and the convertible notes are unsecured 
the refinancing in february increased the company s working capital  because the debt which was being repaid was all short term  and most of the new debt was long term 
during fiscal the level of outstanding debt for borrowed money declined from million on september  to million on september  this million reduction in outstanding borrowings was accomplished primarily through 
table of contents operating cash flows  the reduction of customer receivables and increased vendor payables  partially offset by increased inventories 
the company s senior credit agreement was amended in july to delete a provision that made a material adverse change in the company an event of default 
the senior credit agreement was also amended in december the original terms provided for an increase  starting september   in the required level of tangible net worth  that the company did not meet 
the amendment changed the required levels of tangible net worth at that date and into the future  and as of the date of this filing  the company is in compliance with this and the other requirements of the credit agreement 
the company s ability to borrow under the senior credit facilities depends on maintaining a borrowing base of eligible accounts receivable and to a lesser extent eligible inventory  and complying with financial covenants concerning tangible net worth  debt service coverage  interest coverage and maximum capital expenditures 
if the company is unable to generate a sufficient borrowing base and comply with the financial covenants and other requirements of the credit facilities  it will limit or prevent borrowing under the credit facility and could have a serious adverse effect on the company 
accounts receivable decreased to million at september  from million at september   primarily due to the lower sales level in fiscal  compared with fiscal  particularly in the latter half of fiscal this decrease was partially offset by a decrease in the allowance for doubtful accounts 
inventory levels increased to million at september  from million at september   primarily due to an increase in finished goods inventory  related to the introduction of the cr series systems 
several units were produced for placement at customer sites for purchase evaluation 
as of september   the allowance for doubtful accounts was  during fiscal   was written off against that allowance and the allowance was increased by  to cover estimated credit exposures 
the balance of the allowance for doubtful accounts as of september  was  cash and short term investments decreased to million at september   from million at september  the decrease in cash and short term investments was primarily due to a change in the way revolving loans are repaid 
previously the company had a degree of discretion as to timing of principal payments on revolving loans 
under the new credit facility all cash receipts are automatically applied to pay down outstanding revolving loans and the company re borrows to obtain working capital 
in addition  as of september   cash levels were higher to meet anticipated near term cash requirements  including payroll funding by october  deferred revenue totaled  as of september   compared with million as of september  of which  was current and  was long term 
the decrease was primarily due to cancellation of a long term note receivable from a customer 
prior to cancellation  deferred revenue related to the note receivable was recognized in monthly installments  matched against proportionate cost of sales 
the company has undertaken no significant investing activities 
no significant capital investment has been undertaken or is planned  and at september   the company had no material commitments for capital expenditures 
short term investments are purchased as cash is available and sold as they mature 
the company expects higher equipment sales levels in fiscal  compared with  led by the introduction of the cr digital printing system 
revenue from maintenance  spare parts and supplies in fiscal  relative to fiscal  is anticipated to exceed the erosion in maintenance  spare parts and supplies sales for the company s legacy equipment products 
in general  the company anticipates that its gross margin percentage for fiscal will be lower than for fiscal as the company expects to derive a greater proportion of fiscal revenues from the sale of equipment 
the company anticipates  but cannot assure  that fiscal cash flow from operations will be higher than the million achieved for fiscal  and that a substantial portion of that cash flow  if achieved  would be used to reduce trade accounts payable and repay debt
