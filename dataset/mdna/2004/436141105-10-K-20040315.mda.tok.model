item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition about hollywood entertainment we are the second largest rental retailer of dvds  videocassettes and video games in the united states 
we opened our first video store in october and  as of december   we operated  hollywood video stores in states and the district of columbia 
as of december   we also operated game crazy stores  which are game specialty stores where game enthusiasts can buy  sell and trade new and used video game hardware  software and accessories 
a typical game crazy store carries over  video game titles and occupies an area of approximately to square feet adjacent to a hollywood video store 
hollywood video stores accounted for of consolidated revenue in while game crazy contributed 
hollywood video derives of its revenue from rentals of dvd and vhs movies and video games and from the sale of previously viewed movies and games 
the remaining of hollywood video s revenue is from the sale of new dvd and vhs movies and concessions 
although domestic consumer rental spending has remained fairly flat over the past five years  hollywood video stores have been able to generate positive same store sales by taking market share 
we believe we can continue to take market share as the rental industry is still highly fragmented 
we estimate approximately half of the market share remains divided amongst a relatively large number of smaller independent and regional operators 
the studio s current movie distribution practice provides an exclusive window for dvd and vhs retail channels before the movies are available to pay per view  video on demand and other distribution channels 
changes in the studio distribution practice or changes in pricing of movies could negatively impact our business 
for a discussion of risks inherent to rental retailers in general and hollywood video in particular  please see cautionary statements 
game crazy generates revenue from the sale of new and used game software  hardware and accessories 
the video game industry  an approximately billion market in the united states in according to npd group  inc  has historically experienced peaks and valleys in consumer spending dependent upon the availability of new technology 
in and  sony s playstation  nintendo s gamecube and microsoft s xbox  three new generation hardware technology products  were introduced 
these platforms have substantially increased the installed base of video game hardware units and have driven significant growth in the video game software segment 
as with the introduction of previous new platforms  consumers have increased both their purchase and rental of games 
buying  selling and trading used games is relatively new and has caused the used game category to grow rapidly for certain specialty retailers 
each new platform introduction has increased trade ins of used titles compatible with legacy hardware  which in turn extends the life of older platforms by enabling the game consumer access to additional software titles through the used market 
our strategy is to successfully build and operate two separately managed national chains  each with a retail model designed to compete favorably against the primary competitors in its segment of the entertainment industry 
the hollywood video retail model  including the types of real estate sites we pursue  the store design  employee hiring and training practices  and inventory and merchandising standards  is designed to maximize the number of customers per store  as well as the frequency of customer visits and the amount that consumers spend per visit 
hollywood video stores are typically located in high traffic  high visibility locations with convenient access and parking 
inside the store  we focus on providing a superior selection of movies and video games for rent  in a friendly and inviting atmosphere that encourages browsing 
we believe that consumers view movie rentals in general  and our pricing structure and rental terms in particular  as a convenient form of entertainment and an excellent value 
our game crazy retail model  including the core concept of allowing consumers to buy  sell and trade new and used merchandise  combined with store design  employee selection and training  and our inventory selection and merchandising presentation  is designed to appeal to both hard core and casual game consumers 
remerchandising a hollywood video in order to accommodate a game crazy  including reducing its size  does not cannibalize hollywood video revenue 
further  we believe that there is significant customer overlap  enabling the hollywood video and game crazy retail models to complement each other  allowing each of the concepts to have a competitive advantage versus its primary competitor 
we analyze operating results by segment  hollywood video and game crazy 
key indicators used in running our business include total revenue growth  same store sales  gross margin rates  inventory levels  and operating expenses in dollars and as percentage of revenue 
we also assess rental revenue performance by product type  dvd  vhs and games 
our operating results are subject to the application of critical accounting policies as discussed in critical accounting policies and estimates 
these policies require management to make significant estimates  judgements and assumptions that are subject to uncertainties that may change as additional information becomes known 
results of operations summary results of operations our income from operations for was million compared to million for the decrease was primarily due to operating losses incurred by game crazy for and a million reversal of an accrual related to the closure of our former internet business  reel 
com  that benefited income from operations for for  hollywood video generated million in income from operations while game crazy generated a net loss from operations of million 
our net income for was million compared with net income of million and million for and  respectively 
the decrease in net income was primarily the result of a change in our provision for income taxes 
net income for and benefited from a reduction in our valuation allowance on our deferred income tax assets  resulting in an income tax benefit of million and million  respectively 
we believe that an effective tax rate of would have represented a normalized provision for income taxes excluding the valuation allowance reductions 
the effective tax rate for was 
also contributing to the decrease in net income for was a million charge recorded in the first quarter of for early debt retirement compared to an early debt retirement charge in the first quarter of of million

we currently offer a day rental program on all products in the majority of our stores 
all dvds and new release vhs movies typically rent for 
catalog vhs movies typically rent for 
since the fourth quarter of  we have not increased prices on dvds  new release vhs or catalog vhs 
video games rent for and  with games designed for the newer platforms renting for the higher amount 
customers who choose not to return movies within the applicable rental period are deemed to have commenced a new rental period of equal length at the same price 
revenue recorded for extended rental periods is net of estimated amounts that we do not anticipate collecting based upon historical collection experience 
the percentage of rental revenues generated from extended rental periods has not changed significantly in several years 
game crazy revenue represented of consolidated merchandise revenue for game crazy revenue is generated from the sale of new and used video game hardware  software and accessories 
the remaining of merchandise revenue was generated in hollywood video stores through the sale of new dvd and vhs movies and concessions 
gross margin rental product margins rental gross margin as a percentage of rental revenue increased to for from for and for the increase for compared to was primarily due to a shift in revenue from vhs product to dvd product  which typically has higher gross margins 
the increase for compared to also benefited from increased dvd revenue as well as the absence of incremental amortization that was recorded in associated with an amortization change in estimate 
the company regularly evaluates and updates rental inventory accounting estimates 
effective october   estimated average residual values on new release movies was reduced from to for dvd and from to for vhs 
in addition  the estimated residual value of catalog dvd inventory was reduced from to 
these changes resulted in a million increase in cost of rental product in we also made several key observations that led us to change estimates regarding rental inventory lives and residual values during the fourth quarter of as a result of the growing demand for dvds  the estimated residual value of catalog vhs cassettes was reduced from to and the estimated useful life was reduced from five years to one year 
we adopted the changes in estimate prospectively on october   and recorded a charge of million 
by applying these changes prospectively  we also recorded incremental depreciation expense of approximately million and million in the fourth quarter of and in the first three quarters of  respectively 
merchandise sales margins merchandise sales gross margin as a percentage of merchandise sales increased to for from for and for the increase is primarily the result of an increase in the percentage of merchandise sales from game crazy and hollywood video s concessions business  which typically have higher margins than new movie sales in hollywood video 
in  game crazy revenue accounted for of consolidated merchandise revenue with a gross margin rate of  while hollywood video accounted for the remainder with a gross margin rate of 
operating costs and expenses operating and selling expenses total operating and selling expenses for decreased as a percentage of revenue to from for the percentage decrease was primarily the result of leverage from increased revenue 
total operating and selling expense for increased million to million from million for the increase was primarily the result of increased variable costs associated with increased store revenue  an increase of weighted average stores and an increase in operating and selling expenses associated with the expansion of our game crazy stores 
payroll and related expenses increased by million  rent and related expenses increased by million  advertising increased by million  and other operating and selling expenses increased by million for compared to total operating and selling expenses for decreased as a percentage of revenue to from for the percentage decrease was primarily the result of leverage from increased revenue 
total operating and selling expense for increased million to million from million for the increase was primarily the result of increased variable costs associated with increased store revenue and an increase in operating and selling expenses associated with the expansion of game crazy stores 
payroll and related expenses increased by million and other operating and selling expenses increased by million for compared to general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses for increased million to million  or of total revenue  from million  or of total revenue for included in general and administrative expenses for was a million charge recognized in the first quarter to increase a class action litigation settlement reserve related to extended rental periods 
general and administrative expenses for benefited from the net reversal of approximately million of non cash stock option expense 
the million benefit reflects stock option expense of million recorded in the first  second and fourth quarters and a net reversal of expense of million recorded in the third quarter primarily associated with the cancellation of stock options subject to variable plan accounting 
general and administrative expenses for also benefited from the reversal of a legal accrual in the amount of million  as a result of the final confirmation of the settlement of our california exempt non exempt class action lawsuit for an amount less than anticipated 
excluding these items  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue were consistent for and general and administrative expenses for decreased million to million  or of total revenue  from million  or of total revenue for general and administrative expenses for benefited from the net reversal of approximately million of non cash stock option expense and also benefited from a million reversal of a legal accrual 
included in general and administrative expenses in were million of non cash compensation expense related to a stock grant to our chief executive officer as part of a three year employment agreement 
also included was million of non cash stock compensation associated with other grants under our stock option plans 
excluding these items  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue declined slightly in as compared non operating income expense  net interest expense interest expense  net of interest income  decreased in as compared to by million 
the reduction was primarily due to decreased borrowing levels and lower interest rates see note to our consolidated financial statements for a description of our outstanding debt 
interest expense  net of interest income  decreased in as compared to by million 
the reduction was primarily due to decreased levels of revolving credit borrowings and lower interest rates offset by incremental interest for bonds issued on december  early debt retirement in the first quarter of  we redeemed the outstanding million senior subordinated notes due and retired our prior credit facility due as a result  we recorded a charge of million that included an early redemption premium of million and the write off of deferred financing costs 
in the first quarter of  we paid all amounts outstanding and retired our credit facility in place at that time  resulting in a million charge to write off deferred financing costs 
income taxes our effective tax rate was a provision of in  compared to a benefit of in and a benefit of in  which varies from the federal statutory rate as a result of adjustments to deferred tax asset valuation allowances  non deductible executive compensation  non deductible goodwill amortization associated with the reel 
com acquisition and state income taxes 
we anticipate an effective tax rate of for in the fourth quarter of  in light of significant doubt that existed regarding our future income and therefore our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards  we recorded a million valuation allowance on our million net deferred tax asset 
in and  as a result of our operating performance for each year  as well as anticipated future operating performance  we determined that it was more likely than not that certain future tax benefits would be realized 
consequently  we benefited by the reversal of million and million of the valuation allowance in and  respectively 
in the fourth quarter of we applied for a change in accounting method with the internal revenue service irs to accelerate the deduction of store pre opening supplies and the amortization of dvd and vhs movies and video games 
the application is under review by the irs 
based on internal forecasts and utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards  we do not anticipate significant cash tax payments until rental inventory analysis of rental inventory and investment in rental product when analyzing our rental inventory purchase activity  it is important to consider that we acquire new releases of movies under two different pricing structures  revenue sharing and sell through 
these methods impact the dollar amount of new releases held as rental inventory on our consolidated balance sheet 
under revenue sharing  in exchange for acquiring agreed upon quantities of dvds or tapes at reduced or no up front costs  we share agreed upon portions of the revenue that we derive from the dvds or tapes with the studio 
the studio s share of rental revenue is expensed  net of an estimated residual value  as revenue is earned on revenue sharing titles 
the resulting revenue sharing expense is considered a direct cost of sales rather than an investment in rental inventory 
under sell through pricing  we purchase movies from the studios with no obligation for future payments to the studios 
sell through purchases are recognized as an investment in rental inventory  which is then amortized to cost of rental product over its estimated useful life to an estimated residual value 
therefore  purchases of rental inventories  as shown on our consolidated statement of cash flows  are not reflective of the total costs of acquiring movies for rental and are impacted by the mix of movies acquired under these pricing structures 
cost of rental product included revenue sharing expense of million for  compared to million for and million for the decline in revenue sharing expense is primarily the result of an increase in the percentage of movies acquired in the dvd format compared to vhs  as we currently have fewer dvd revenue sharing arrangements than vhs revenue sharing arrangements 
merchandise inventory merchandise inventory in hollywood video stores consists of new dvd and vhs movies for sale  concessions and accessory items for sale  and the residual book value of movies and games that are transferred from rental inventory to merchandise inventory to be sold as previously viewed product 
merchandise inventory in our game crazy stores consist of new and used game software  hardware and accessories 
consolidated merchandise inventory increased million to million as of december   from million as of december  the increase was primarily due to the addition of game crazy stores in and an increase in the breadth and depth of games at existing game crazy stores 
liquidity and capital resources overview our primary source of operating cash flow is generated from the rental and sales of dvds  videocassettes and games 
the amount of cash generated from our video store operations in funded our debt service requirements  maintenance capital expenditures  and game crazy operating losses and provided the capital required to add game crazy stores and hollywood video stores 
at december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents on hand 
during and early  we completed several refinancing transactions that lengthened maturities on our long term debt  lowered our effective interest rate and increased working capital availability see cash used in financing activities below 
we believe that cash flow from operations  increased flexibility under our new credit facilities  cash on hand and trade credit will provide adequate liquidity and capital resources to execute our business plan for the foreseeable future  including our expansion plans discussed below in cash used in investing activities 
we continue to analyze our capital structure and our business plan and from time to time may consider additional capital and or financing transactions as a source of incremental liquidity 
cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was million and million for and  respectively 
the increase of million or was primarily due to an increase in income from operations in our hollywood video stores and favorable changes in working capital accounts  offset by operating losses incurred by our game crazy stores 
cash used in investing activities net cash used in investing activities was million and million for and  respectively 
net cash used in investing activities for included a million source of cash related to a financing transaction 
on december   we completed the sale of million senior subordinated notes due and delivered net proceeds of million to the indenture trustee to redeem million of the million senior subordinated notes due the delivery of the proceeds to the indenture trustee and the subsequent use of the proceeds to redeem the notes in the first quarter of were classified as investing activities 
in  we opened hollywood video stores  of which included a game crazy  and remerchandised stores to include a game crazy compared to opening hollywood video stores and remerchandising stores to include game crazy in we currently anticipate investing approximately million in to open hollywood video stores  of which approximately may include a game crazy  to remerchandise existing hollywood video stores to include a game crazy  and for maintenance capital expenditures in property and equipment 
we regularly consider new business initiatives that would enhance  expand  or complement our position in the entertainment industry 
some of those under consideration  such as in store subscription services and mail delivery rental services  are closely related to our existing business 
any initiative undertaken could require significant capital investment  could be unsuccessful  or  even if successful  could have a short term adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results 
cash used in financing activities net cash flow from financing activities was a million use of cash for compared to a million source of cash in the corresponding period of the prior year 
the million use of cash reflects the redemption of million senior subordinated notes and the retirement of our prior credit facility of million with million in proceeds from the indenture trustee and million of initial borrowings under our new credit facility 
the use of cash also reflects the repurchase of  shares of common stock for million and million for prepayment of term loan facility principal payments through in january  we paid an additional million on the term loan facility  and are now prepaid through and we also repurchased  shares of common stock for million 
on march   we completed a public offering of  shares of our common stock  resulting in proceeds of million before fees and expenses  of which million was applied to the repayment of borrowings under our prior revolving credit facility 
on march   we obtained senior bank credit facilities from a syndicate of lenders led by ubs warburg llc and applied a portion of initial borrowings thereunder to repay all remaining borrowings under our prior revolving credit facility  which was then terminated 
the bank credit facilities consisted of a million senior secured term facility maturing in and a million senior secured revolving credit facility maturing in on december   we completed the sale of million senior subordinated notes due we delivered the net proceeds from the transaction to the indenture trustee to redeem million of the million senior subordinated notes due  including accrued interest and the required call premium 
at december   the trustee was holding million and we continued to carry the million senior subordinated notes on our balance sheet  million of which was classified as a current liability titled subordinated notes to be retired with cash held by trustee 
on january   the redemption of million of the notes was completed 
on january   we obtained new senior secured credit facilities from a syndicate of lenders led by ubs warburg llc 
the new facilities consist of a million term loan facility and a million revolving credit facility  each maturing in we used the borrowings under the term loan facility to repay amounts outstanding under our existing credit facilities which were due in  redeem the remaining million principal amount of our senior subordinated notes due on february  and for general corporate purposes 
we have prepaid million of the term loan facility principal payments due through  including a million payment made on january  instruments governing our indebtedness contain various covenants  including covenants requiring us to meet specified financial ratios and tests and covenants that restrict our business including our ability to pay dividends and limitations on the amount of common stock we can repurchase 
at december   we were in compliance with all covenants contained within our debt agreements 
at december   maturities on long term obligations for the next five years are as follows in thousands capital year ending subordinated credit leases december  notes facility other total thereafter   paid on january  contractual obligations our contractual obligations consist of long term debt  operating leases primarily store leases and capital leases 
we lease all of our stores  corporate offices  distribution centers and zone offices under non cancelable operating leases 
all of our stores have an initial operating lease term of five to years and most have options to renew for between five and additional years 
contractual obligations as of december  are as follows in thousands contractual more than obligations total year years years years long term debt     capital leases  operating leases      total      other financial measurements working capital at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and a working capital deficit of million 
the working capital deficit is primarily the result of the accounting treatment of rental inventory 
rental inventories are accounted for as non current assets under gaap because they are not assets that are reasonably expected to be completely realized in cash or sold in the normal business cycle 
although the rental of this inventory generates a substantial portion of our revenue and the majority of this inventory has a relatively short useful life as evidenced by our amortization policies  the classification of these assets as non current excludes them from the computation of working capital 
the acquisition cost of rental inventories  however  is reported as a current liability until paid and  accordingly  included in the computation of working capital 
consequently  we believe working capital is not as significant a measure of financial condition for companies in the video rental industry as it is for companies in other industries 
because of the accounting treatment of rental inventory as a non current asset  we will  more likely than not  operate with a working capital deficit 
we believe the current existence of a working capital deficit does not affect our ability to operate our business and meet our obligations as they come due 
critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition we recognize revenue upon the rental and sale of our products 
rental revenue for extended rental periods when the customer chooses to keep the product beyond the original rental period is recognized when the extended rental period begins 
revenue recorded for extended rental periods is net of estimated amounts that we do not anticipate collecting based upon historical collection experience 
we continuously monitor actual collections 
estimates are revised when we believe it is appropriate in light of actual collection rates and other relevant circumstances 
historically  actual collections have approximated the related net revenue recorded 
however  if actual collections in the future are less than the related net revenue recorded  our results of operations would be adversely affected 
merchandise inventory valuation merchandise inventories  consisting primarily of new and used video game software and hardware  new dvd and vhs movies and concessions  are stated at the lower of cost or market 
we consider several factors in our assessment of market value including age and inventory turns 
due to the numerous variables associated with the judgments and assumptions we make in estimating market values  and the effects of changes in circumstances affecting these estimates including the effects of competing products and technologies  both the precision and reliability of the resulting estimates are subject to substantial uncertainties and  as additional information becomes known  we may change our estimates significantly 
amortization of rental inventory rental inventory  which includes dvd and vhs movies and video games  is stated at cost and amortized over its estimated useful life to an estimated residual value 
we analyze several metrics to validate our estimates such as inventory turns  previously viewed product sales and average inventory levels per store among many other variables 
our estimates of useful lives and residual values affect the amounts of amortization recorded  which in turn affects the carrying value of our rental inventory and cost of rental product and  upon the transfer of previously viewed items from rental inventory to merchandise inventory  the carrying value of our merchandise inventory 
for new release movies acquired for rental under revenue sharing arrangements  the studios share of rental revenue is expensed as revenue is earned net of average estimated residual values 
dvds  tapes and video games acquired for rental at fixed prices are amortized to estimated residual values in periods ranging from four months to five years for dvd library 
due to the numerous variables associated with the judgments and assumptions we make in estimating useful lives and residual values of these items  and the effects of changes in circumstances affecting these estimates including the effects of competing products and technologies and actual selling prices obtainable for previously viewed product  both the precision and reliability of the resulting estimates are subject to substantial uncertainties and  as additional information becomes known  we may change our estimates significantly 
for example  in the fourth quarter of  a number of observations led us to change our estimates of rental inventory lives and residual values  which resulted in a million increase to amortization expense in that quarter 
more recently  in the fourth quarter of  our updated estimates resulted in a million increase in cost of rental 
impairment of long lived assets and goodwill we review long lived assets and goodwill for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
we periodically review and monitor our internal management reports for indicators of impairment 
we consider a trend of unsatisfactory operating results that are not in line with management s expectations to be a primary indicator of potential impairment 
when an indicator of impairment is noted  assets are evaluated for impairment at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows eg at the store level 
we deem a store to be impaired if a forecast of undiscounted future operating cash flows directly related to the store  including estimated disposal value  if any  is less than the asset carrying amount 
if a store is determined to be impaired  the loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount on our balance sheet of the store exceeds its fair value 
fair value is estimated using a discounted future cash flow valuation technique similar to that used by management in making a new investment decision 
considerable management judgment and assumptions are necessary to estimate discounted future cash flows 
due to the numerous variables associated with our judgments and assumptions relating to the valuation of our assets in these circumstances  and the effects of changes in circumstances affecting these valuations  both the precision and reliability of the resulting estimates of the related impairment charges are subject to substantial uncertainties and  as additional information becomes known  our estimates may change significantly 
income taxes we calculate income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in our financial statements and tax returns 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets  including temporary timing differences and net operating loss carryforwards  to the amount expected to be realized in the future 
deferred assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
in the fourth quarter of  in light of significant doubt that existed regarding our future income and therefore our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards  we recorded a million valuation allowance on our million net deferred tax asset 
in and  as a result of our operating performance for each year  as well as anticipated future operating performance  we determined that it was more likely than not that certain future tax benefits would be realized 
we therefore reversed million and million of this valuation allowance in and  respectively  which resulted in a corresponding increase in net income and corresponding increases decreases in our shareholders equity deficit 
while changes in the valuation allowance have no effect on the amount of income tax we pay or on our cash flows  the effects on our reported income and shareholders equity may be viewed by some investors and potential lenders as significant 
due to the numerous variables associated with our judgments  assumptions and estimates relating to the valuation of our deferred tax assets  and the effects of changes in circumstances affecting these valuations  both the precision and reliability of the resulting estimates are subject to substantial uncertainties and  as additional information becomes known  we may change our estimates significantly 
legal contingencies our estimates of our loss contingencies for legal proceedings are based on various judgments and assumptions regarding the potential resolution or disposition of the underlying claims and associated costs 
due to the numerous variables associated with these judgments and assumptions  both the precision and reliability of the resulting estimates of the related loss contingencies are subject to substantial uncertainties 
we regularly monitor our estimated exposure to these contingencies with formal meetings between our chief financial officer and internal legal counsel and  as additional information becomes known  we may change our estimates significantly 
recently issued accounting standards see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recently issued accounting standards and the impact they may have on the financial condition or results of operations 
forward looking statements this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  that involve substantial risks and uncertainties and which are intended to be covered by the safe harbors created thereby 
these statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical information and include the words expects  believes  anticipates  plans  may  will  intend  estimate  continue or other similar expressions 
these forward looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those currently anticipated 
these risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  items discussed below under the heading cautionary statements 
forward looking statements speak only as of the date made 
we undertake no obligation to publicly release or update forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
you are  however  advised to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our quarterly reports on form q and any reports made on form k to the securities and exchange commission 
cautionary statements we are subject to a number of risks that are particular to our business and that may or may not affect our competitors 
we describe some of these risks below 
if any of these risks materialize  our business  financial condition  liquidity and results of operations could be harmed  and the value of our securities could fall 
we face intense competition and risks associated with technological obsolescence  and we may be unable to compete effectively 
the home video and home video game industries are highly competitive 
we compete with local  regional and national video retail stores  including those operated by blockbuster  inc  the largest video retailer in the united states  and with mass merchants  specialty retailers  supermarkets  pharmacies  convenience stores  bookstores  mail order operations  online stores and other retailers  as well as with noncommercial sources  such as libraries 
we also compete with internet based mail delivery video rental subscription services  such as netflix 
substantially all of our stores compete with stores operated by blockbuster  most in very close proximity 
some of our competitors have significantly greater financial and marketing resources  market share and name recognition than hollywood 
as a result of direct competition with blockbuster and others  pricing strategies for videos and video games is a significant competitive factor in our business 
our home video and home video game businesses also compete with other forms of entertainment  including cinema  television  sporting events and family entertainment centers 
if we do not compete effectively with competitors in the home video industry or the home video game industry or with providers of other forms of entertainment  our revenues and or our profit margin could decline and our business  financial condition  liquidity and results of operations could be harmed 
we also compete with cable and direct broadcast satellite television systems 
these systems offer both movie channels  for which subscribers pay a subscription fee for access to movies selected by the provider at times selected by the provider  and pay per view services  for which subscribers pay a discrete fee to view a particular movie selected by the subscriber 
historically  pay per view services have offered a limited number of channels and movies  and have offered movies only at scheduled intervals 
over the past five years  however  advances in digital compression and other developing technologies have enabled cable and satellite companies  and may enable internet service providers and others  to transmit a significantly greater number of movies to homes at more frequently scheduled intervals throughout the day 
in addition  certain cable companies  internet service providers and others are testing or offering video on demand services 
as a concept  video on demand provides a subscriber with the ability to view any movie included in a catalog of titles maintained by the provider at any time of the day 
if video on demand or other alternative movie delivery systems whether alone or in conjunction with sophisticated digital recording systems that allow viewers to record  pause  rewind and fast forward live broadcasts  achieve the ability to enable consumers to conveniently view and control the movies they want to see when they want to see them and they receive the movies from the studios at the same time video stores do  such alternative movie delivery systems could achieve a competitive advantage over the traditional video rental industry 
while we believe that there presently exist substantial technological  economic and other impediments to alternative movie delivery systems achieving such a competitive advantage  if they did  our business and financial condition could suffer materially 
changes in the way that movie studios price dvds and or videocassettes could adversely affect our revenues and profit margins 
movie studios use various pricing models to maximize the revenues they receive from the home video industry 
historically  these pricing models have enabled a profitable video rental market to exist and compete effectively with mass merchant retailers and other sellers of home videos 
if the studios were to significantly change their pricing policies in a manner that increases our cost of obtaining movies under revenue sharing or other arrangements  or decreases wholesale prices leading consumers to purchase movies instead of renting movies  our revenues and or profit margin could decrease  and our business  financial condition  liquidity and results of operations could be harmed 
we can neither control nor predict with certainty whether the studios pricing policies will continue to enable us to operate our business as profitably as we can under current pricing arrangements 
we could lose a significant competitive advantage if the movie studios were to adversely change their current distribution practices 
currently  video stores receive movie titles approximately to days earlier than pay per view  cable and satellite distribution companies 
if movie studios were to change the current distribution schedule for movie titles such that video stores were no longer the first major distribution channel to receive a movie title after its theatrical or direct to video release or to provide for the earlier release of movie titles to competing distribution channels  we could be deprived of a significant competitive advantage  which could negatively impact the demand for our products and reduce our revenues and could harm our business  financial condition  liquidity and results of operations 
the video store industry could be adversely impacted by conditions affecting the motion picture industry 
the video store industry is dependent on the continued production and availability of motion pictures produced by movie studios 
any conditions that adversely affect the motion picture industry  including constraints on capital  financial difficulties  regulatory requirements and strikes  work stoppages or other disruptions involving writers  actors or other essential personnel  could reduce the number and quality of the new release titles in our stores 
this in turn could reduce consumer demand and negatively impact our revenues  which would harm our business  financial condition  liquidity and results of operations 
the failure of video game software and hardware manufacturers to timely introduce new products could hurt our ability to attract and retain video game customers 
we are dependent on the introduction of new and enhanced video games and game systems to attract and retain video game customers 
we currently anticipate that hardware manufactures will release new products with enhanced features some time in if manufacturers fail to introduce or delay the introduction of new games and systems  the demand for games available to us could decline  negatively impacting our revenues  and our business  financial condition  liquidity and results of operations could be harmed 
expansion of our store base and new business initiatives have placed and may continue to place pressure on our operations and management controls 
we have expanded the size of our store base and the geographic scope of operations significantly since our inception 
between and we opened an average of stores per year 
in the second half of we began an accelerated rollout of our game crazy stores  stores within our hollywood video stores that specialize in selling and trading video games  opening new stores 
in we added game crazy stores and opened hollywood video stores and we anticipate adding additional game crazy stores and opening additional hollywood video stores in and beyond 
this expansion has placed  and may continue to place  increased pressure on our operating and management controls 
to manage a larger store base and additional game crazy stores  we will need to continue to evaluate and improve our financial controls  management information systems and distribution facilities 
we may not adequately anticipate or respond to all of the changing demands of expansion on our infrastructure 
in addition  our ability to open and operate new stores in a profitable manner depends upon numerous contingencies  many of which are beyond our control 
these contingencies include but are not limited to our ability under the terms of the instruments governing our existing and future indebtedness to make capital expenditures associated with new store openings  our ability to locate suitable store sites  negotiate acceptable lease terms  and build out or refurbish sites on a timely and cost effective basis  our ability to hire  train and retain skilled associates  and our ability to integrate new stores into our existing operations 
we may also open stores in markets where we already have significant operations in order to maximize our market share within these markets 
if we do so  we cannot assure you that these newly opened stores will not adversely affect the revenues and profitability of those pre existing stores in any given market 
we also regularly consider new business initiatives that would enhance  expand  or complement our position in the entertainment industry 
some of those under consideration  such as in store subscription services and mail delivery rental services  are closely related to our existing business 
any initiative undertaken could require significant capital investment  could be unsuccessful  or  even if successful  could have a short term adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results 
we depend on key personnel whom we may not be able to retain 
our future performance depends on the continued contributions of certain key management personnel 
from late through mid  we made significant changes to our management personnel  including reinstatement of mark j 
wattles  hollywood s founder and chief executive officer  full time as president  and hiring or restructuring other executive and senior management positions 
new members of management may not be able to successfully manage our existing operations and they may not remain with us 
a loss of one or more of these key management personnel  our inability to attract and retain additional key management personnel  including qualified store managers  or the inability of management to successfully manage our operations could prevent us from implementing our business strategy and harm our business  financial condition  liquidity or results of operations 
the failure of our management information systems to perform as we anticipate could harm our business 
the efficient operation of our business is dependent on our management information systems 
in particular  we rely on an inventory utilization system used by our merchandise organization and in our distribution centers to track rental activity by individual dvd  videocassette and video game to determine appropriate buying  distribution and disposition of dvds  videocassettes and video games 
in addition  our game crazy point of sale system is used to determine appropriate used game trade in values and used game prices 
we use a scalable client server system to maintain information  updated daily  regarding revenue  current and historical rental and sales activity  demographics of store membership  individual customer history  and dvd  videocassette and video game rental patterns 
we rely on these systems as well as our proprietary point of sale and in store systems to keep our in store inventories at optimum levels  to move inventory efficiently and to track and record our performance 
the failure of our management information systems to perform as we anticipate could impair our ability to manage our inventory and monitor our performance and harm our business  financial condition  liquidity and results of operations 
we have a substantial amount of indebtedness and debt service obligations  which could adversely affect our financial and operational flexibility and increase our vulnerability to adverse conditions 
as of december   we had total consolidated long term debt  including capital leases  of approximately million 
we and our subsidiary could incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future  including indebtedness that would be secured by our assets or those of our subsidiary 
if we increase our indebtedness  the related risks that we now face could intensify 
for example  it could require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to payments on our indebtedness  limit our ability to borrow additional funds  increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  limit our ability to fund future working capital  capital expenditures and other general corporate requirements  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate or taking advantage of potential business opportunities  limit our ability to execute our business strategy successfully  and place us at a potential competitive disadvantage in our industry 
our ability to satisfy our indebtedness obligations will depend on our financial and operating performance  which may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and is subject to economic  industry and market conditions and to risks related to our business and other factors beyond our control 
we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in amounts sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs 
instruments governing our existing and future indebtedness contain or may contain various covenants  including covenants requiring us to meet specified financial ratios and tests and covenants that restrict our business 
our failure to comply with all applicable covenants could result in our indebtedness being immediately due and payable 
the instruments governing our existing indebtedness contain various covenants which  among other things  limit our ability to make capital expenditures and require us to meet specified financial ratios  which generally become more stringent over time  including a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum interest and rent coverage ratio 
the instruments governing our future indebtedness may impose similar or other restrictions and may require us to meet similar or other financial ratios and tests 
our ability to comply with covenants contained in the instruments governing our existing and future indebtedness may be affected by events and circumstances beyond our control 
if we breach any of these covenants  one or more events of default  including cross defaults between multiple components of our indebtedness  could result 
these events of default could permit our creditors to declare all amounts owing to be immediately due and payable  and terminate any commitments to make further extensions of credit 
if we were unable to repay indebtedness owed to our secured creditors  they could proceed against the collateral securing the indebtedness owed to them 
at december   we were in compliance with all covenants contained within our debt agreements 
instruments governing our bank credit facilities and our senior subordinated notes contain  and our future indebtedness may contain  covenants that  among other things  significantly restrict our ability to open new stores  incur additional indebtedness  repurchase shares of our common stock  guarantee third party obligations  enter into capital leases  create liens on assets  dispose of assets  repay indebtedness or amend debt instruments  make capital expenditures  make investments  loans or advances  pay dividends  make acquisitions or engage in mergers or consolidations  and engage in certain transactions with our subsidiaries and affiliates 
we are subject to governmental regulations that impose obligations and restrictions and may increase our costs 
we are subject to various us federal and state laws that govern  among other things  the disclosure and retention of our video rental records and access and use of our hollywood video stores by disabled persons  and are subject to various state and local licensing  zoning  land use  construction and environment regulations 
furthermore  changes in existing laws  including environmental and employment laws  new laws or increases in the minimum wage may increase our costs 
terrorist attacks  such as the attacks that occurred in new york and washington  dc on september   and other acts of violence or war may affect the markets on which our common stock trades  the markets in which we operate  our operations and our profitability 
any of these events could cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease further or result in increased volatility in the united states and worldwide financial markets and economy 
they could also impact consumer television viewing habits and may reduce the amount of time available for watching rented movies  which could adversely impact our revenue 
they also could result in an economic recession in the united states or abroad 
any of these occurrences could harm our business  financial condition or results of operations  and may result in the volatility of the market price for our securities and on the future price of our securities 
terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war may negatively affect our operations and your investment 
there can be no assurance that there will not be further terrorist attacks or other acts of violence or war against the united states or united states businesses 
also  as a result of terrorism  the united states has entered into armed conflict 
these attacks or armed conflicts may directly impact our physical facilities or those of our suppliers 
furthermore  these attacks or armed conflicts may make travel and the transportation of our supplies and products more difficult and more expensive and ultimately affect our revenues 
our quarterly operating results will vary  which may affect the value of our securities in a manner unrelated to our long term performance 
our quarterly operating results have varied in the past and we expect that they will continue to vary in the future depending on a number of factors  many of which are outside of our control 
factors that may cause our quarterly operating results to vary include the level of demand for movie and game rentals and purchases  existing and future competition from providers of similar products and alternative forms of entertainment  the prices for which we are able to rent or sell our products  the availability and cost to us of new release movies  games and game hardware  changes in other significant operating costs and expenses  weather  seasonality  variations in the number and timing of store openings  the performance of newer stores  acquisitions by us of existing video stores  initial investments in and success of new business initiatives and related acquisitions  other factors that may affect retailers in general  changes in movie rental habits resulting from domestic and world events  actual events  circumstances  outcomes and amounts differing from judgments  assumptions and estimates used in determining the amount of certain assets including the amounts of related valuation allowances  liabilities and other items reflected in our consolidated financial statements  and acts of god or public authorities  war  civil unrest  fire  floods  earthquakes  acts of terrorism and other matters beyond our control 
our securities may experience extreme price and volume fluctuations 
the market price of our securities has been and can be expected to be significantly affected by a variety of factors  including public announcements concerning us  our competitors or the home video rental industry and video game industry  fluctuations in our operating results  introductions of new products or services by us or our competitors  the operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies  and changes in analysts revenue or earnings estimates 
in addition to these factors  the market price of our debt securities may be significantly affected by change in market rates of interest  yields obtainable from investments in comparable securities  credit ratings assigned to our debt securities by third parties and perceptions regarding our ability to pay our obligations on our debt securities 
in the past  companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their securities have been the target of securities class action litigation 
if we were sued in a securities class action  we could incur substantial costs and suffer from a diversion of our management s attention and resources 
future sales of shares of our common stock may negatively affect our stock price 
if we or our shareholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market  the market price of our common stock could fall 
in addition  sales of substantial amounts of our common stock might make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity related securities in the future 
we do not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future 
we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and we do not expect to declare dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
the instruments governing our existing and future indebtedness contain or may contain provisions prohibiting or limiting the payment of dividends on our common stock 
provisions of oregon law and our articles of incorporation may make it more difficult to acquire us  even though an acquisition may be beneficial to our shareholders 
provisions of oregon law condition the voting rights that would otherwise be associated with any shares of our common stock that may be acquired in specified transactions deemed to constitute a control share acquisitions upon approval by our shareholders excluding  among other things  the acquirer in any such transaction 
provisions or oregon law also restrict  subject to specified exceptions  the ability of a person owning or more of our common stock to enter into any business combination transaction with us 
in addition  under our articles of incorporation  our board of directors has the authority to issue up to million shares of preferred stock and to fix the rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions of those shares without any further vote or action by the shareholders 
these provisions of oregon law and our articles of incorporation have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of hollywood  may discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over the market price of our common stock and may adversely affect the market price of  and the voting and other rights of the holders of  our common stock and the occurrence of a control share acquisition may constitute an event of default under  or otherwise require us to repurchase or repay  our indebtedness 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position  operating results  or cash flows due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices and rates 
we have entered into certain market risk sensitive financial instruments for other than trading purposes  principally short term and long term debt 
historically  and as of december   we have not held derivative instruments or engaged in hedging activities 
however  we may in the future enter into such instruments for the purpose of addressing market risks  including market risks associated with variable rate indebtedness 
the interest payable on our bank credit facility is based on variable interest rates equal to a specified eurodollar rate or base rate and is therefore affected by changes in market interest rates 
if variable base rates had increased in compared to the end of  our interest expense would have increased by approximately million based on our outstanding balance on the facility as of december  the fair market value of long term fixed interest rate debt is also subject to interest rate risk 
generally  the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
the estimated fair value of our long term fixed interest rate debt at december  was we believe the effect of an estimated change in interest rates would not have a material impact on our future operating results or cash flows with respect to our fixed interest rate debt 
fair values were determined from quoted market prices
