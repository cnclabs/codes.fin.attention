in general  any statements contained in this report that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward looking statements within the meaning of section e 
without limiting the generality of the foregoing  the words believes  anticipates  plans  projects  expects  estimates  and other similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
investors should be aware that such forward looking statements are intended to provide management s current expectations for the future operating and financial performance of the company based on assumptions believed to be valid at the time 
thus  such expectations are inherently subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results of the company to differ materially from those reflected in forward looking statements 
in addition to general economic conditions and market trends  some of the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated include  but are not limited to  the following a major downturn of the united states or european automotive markets although lydall s automotive sales are not solely contingent on the strength of the automotive market  a significant downturn of the united states or european automotive industries or a major decline in production of specific vehicles on which lydall has significant content could have a substantial impact on lydall s results 
the company can also be affected when automotive manufacturers discontinue production of specific models that contain lydall s products 
conversely  lydall benefits from the introduction of new models that contain the company s products 
approximately percent of lydall s total net sales in were to the automotive market 
lydall s automotive products are thermal and acoustical barriers employed both inside and under the body of vehicles 
most of lydall s products are supplied to meet unique  niche applications 
lydall may have a number of components on a particular automotive platform and applications can range across all types of vehicles from sport utility models to trucks  vans and cars 
thus  there is not necessarily a direct correlation between the number of lydall products sold and the number of vehicles being built by automotive manufacturers 
raw material pricing and supply raw material pricing and supply issues affect all of lydall s businesses and can influence results in the short term 
the thermal acoustical segment uses aluminum to manufacture most automotive heat shields 
volatility in aluminum prices could impact the thermal acoustical segment s profitability where the company is selling its products under long term agreements with fixed sales prices 
new product introductions improved performance and growth is partially linked to new product introductions planned for the future 
the timing and degree of success of new product programs could impact lydall s anticipated results 
lydall does not undertake to update any forward looking statement made in this report or that may from time to time be made by or on behalf of the company 
overview during  the company experienced sales growth of percent and selling  product development and administrative expenses remained constant as a percentage of sales 
however  profitability from higher sales was significantly offset by manufacturing inefficiencies at several locations 
in addition  increased overhead costs related to capital investment depreciation and leasing expense for new machinery negatively impacted profitability as production and sales volumes associated with such costs were lower than planned levels in the second half of the year 
as part of the process to address these issues  the company took the following actions in the second quarter of the company consolidated its vital fluids operation from two locations to one 
in december  lydall announced major changes to the company s organizational structure 
the company streamlined the organization and eliminated the group structure in order to move closer to its customers and markets and to leverage logo 
table of contents manufacturing knowledge throughout the company 
as part of this change  the company formed marketing and sales and manufacturing councils comprised of key marketing and operating managers 
these councils will focus on current issues  as well as the long term strategic plans of the company 
in january  the company announced that it will consolidate its columbus  ohio operation into other lydall automotive facilities and close the columbus plant 
the company believes that these changes will help it towards its goal of improving gross margins  and correspondingly increasing profitability  by reducing costs  leveraging overall capacity of existing facilities more effectively  allocating resources more efficiently and allowing it to better serve its customers and markets 
consolidated results of operations net sales for the year ended december   lydall recorded net sales of million compared with million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or percent 
foreign currency translation  which was primarily related to the strengthening of the euro during  increased net sales by approximately percent 
after adjusting for foreign currency translation  net sales growth was attributable to increased sales in the thermal acoustical segment  primarily related to the automotive business during the first three quarters of and continued improvement in sales of active thermal products from the ossipee operation 
additionally  sales of building material and appliance thermal products  liquid filtration products  vital fluids blood transfusion and cell therapy products and products for bioprocessing applications  as well as improved revenues from the warehouse distribution operations of the transport business contributed to the overall sales improvement 
these increases were partially offset by lower sales of air filtration products  vital fluids sales of traditional blood filtration materials  sales of specialty products and a reduction in revenues from the trucking operations of the transport business 
in  the company generated million in net sales compared with million for the year ended december   an increase of million or percent 
the improvement in net sales was attributable to increased sales volumes across all core businesses 
these increases were driven by new platform and product awards in the automotive business and new business gains in filtration and bioprocessing coupled with the incremental sales added by the ossipee operation  acquired in october  and the favorable impact of foreign currency translation of approximately percent 
gross margin lydall recorded total gross margin for the year ended december  of million compared with million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or percent 
gross margin as a percent of net sales was percent compared with percent for the year ended december  although net sales for the company increased during from  several factors unfavorably impacted total gross margin and gross margin as a percent of sales 
these factors included costs related to the consolidation of the vital fluids operations  lower year over year operating performance at the columbus operation  higher fixed overhead costs  operational inefficiencies at several facilities  and changes in sales mix at certain operations 
the company recorded gross margin for the year ended december  of percent of net sales compared with percent for the year ended december  although the company realized an increase in net sales in from  several items negatively impacted gross margin 
these items included a significant operating loss at the columbus operation in the fourth quarter of  increased tooling sales  which typically have low or no gross margin  sales mix changes in other thermal products and start up costs associated with the newport news distribution center 
in addition  order deferrals for air filtration and bioprocessing products in the fourth quarter led to under absorption of factory overhead 
these negative events combined to more than offset the significant improvement in the operating performance of the vital fluids and industrial thermal businesses and gross margin improvement from increased sales volumes of automotive products

 goodwill and other intangible assets  was no longer amortized 
adjusting the amount for the goodwill amortization  selling  product development and administrative expenses increased 
million  or less than percent in from increases from the addition of the ossipee operation and additional accruals for incentive compensation under the eva program were substantially offset by controlled spending  targeted headcount reductions and minimized usage of external consulting 
restructuring activities as part of a strategic evaluation initiated in the fourth quarter of  the company decided to implement a plan to respond to the automotive market demands for increasingly faster  technologically advanced  cost effective solutions 
as a result of this decision  the company determined that it would consolidate the operations of the columbus  ohio plant into existing lydall facilities 
this consolidation within the automotive manufacturing operations supports long term growth strategies for this business and positions the company to more efficiently respond to current and projected market demands 
in line with announced corporate organizational structure changes  the consolidation of the automotive business is expected to improve flexibility  lower costs and utilize overall capacity of existing facilities more effectively

the effective tax rate for was impacted favorably by benefits derived from tax exempt export income  state income tax credits realized during the year  as well as the favorable resolution of a tax audit 
the effective rate on income from continuing operations for the year ending december  was percent 
this rate reflected a benefit associated with the settlement of a tax audit during the year

as a result  the president of the united states has indicated that tax law will be changed to comply with the wto ruling 
during  the eti benefit decreased the company s effective tax rate by approximately percentage points 
at this time the company is unable to determine the impact that the potential changes to united states tax law will have on future financial results  however  it is possible that such changes will adversely affect the company s results of operations and cash flows in future periods

the company had goodwill recorded  net of accumulated amortization  of million at december  and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  fas requires that goodwill and other intangible assets determined to have indefinite lives not be amortized  but rather are subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with the specific guidance and criteria described in the standard 
the identification and measurement of goodwill impairment involves the estimation of the fair value of reporting units as defined in fas  including related goodwill 
the estimates of fair value of reporting units are based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment  which incorporate management assumptions about expected future cash flows as well as other factors 
future cash flows can be affected by numerous factors including changes in economic  industry or market conditions  changes in the underlying business or products of the reporting unit  changes in competition and changes in technology 
any changes in key assumptions about the business and its prospects  changes in any of the factors discussed above or other factors could affect the fair value of one or more of the reporting units resulting in an impairment charge 
such a charge could have a material adverse effect on the company s reported financial condition and results of operations 
although no goodwill impairment has been recorded to date  there can be no assurance that a future impairment of goodwill will not occur

pensions the company accounts for its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for pensions  fas which requires that pension cost and the related obligations recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis 
the determination of such amounts is made in consultation with the company s outside actuaries based on information and assumptions provided by the company 
a substantial portion of the company s pension amounts relate to its defined benefit plans in the united states 
a significant element in determining the company s pension cost is the expected return on plan assets 
based on a review of market trends  actual returns on plan assets and other factors  the company lowered the expected long term rate of return on plan assets from percent used in determining pension cost to percent for determining pension cost and will continue to utilize this expected rate of return for determining pension cost 
the expected long term rate of return on assets is applied to the value of plan assets at the beginning of the year and this produces the expected return on plan assets that is included logo 
table of contents in the determination of pension cost for that year 
the difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred  within certain parameters  as discussed below 
the company continually evaluates its expected long term rate of return and will adjust such rate as deemed appropriate 
at the end of each year  the company determines the discount rate to be used to calculate the present value of plan liabilities  as well as the following year s pension cost 
the discount rate is an estimate of the current interest rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year 
in estimating this rate  the company looks to rates of return on high quality  corporate debt instruments 
at december   the company determined this rate to be percent  a decrease of basis points from the rate used at december  and basis points from that used at december  increases or decreases in the discount rate result in decreases and increases  respectively  in the projected benefit obligation 
the net effect on pension liabilities from changes in the discount rate is deferred within certain parameters  as discussed below 
fas requires that gains or losses as defined in fas be deferred unless the unrecognized net gain or loss at the end of a year exceeds a corridor as defined in fas 
if the deferred gain or loss exceeds the corridor at the end of the year  then the amount in excess of the corridor is amortized over a period equal to the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits 
as of december   the net deferred loss exceeded the corridor 
consequently pension cost for is expected to include amortization of a portion of the deferred loss in excess of the corridor 
the amount of amortization in future years will be dependent on changes in the components of the deferred loss amount  particularly actual return on plan assets in relation to the estimated return on plan assets  as well as future increases or decreases in the discount rate 
for the years ended december   and  the company recognized pension cost of million  million and million  respectively 
as discussed above  the company lowered the discount rate to percent for purposes of determining pension cost 
this is expected to negatively impact pension cost  however  the effect of higher than expected plan asset returns and significant contributions during is expected to offset this impact 
pension cost for is expected to be approximately million

income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes  fas which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
fas also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
deferred tax assets  net of valuation allowance  related to future tax benefits arising from deductible temporary differences and tax carryforwards were million and million at december  and  respectively 
management believes that the company s earnings during the periods when the temporary differences become deductible will be sufficient to realize the related net future income tax benefits 
for those jurisdictions where the projected operating results indicate that the ability to realize the future benefits is uncertain or not likely  a valuation allowance has been provided 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  the company estimates future taxable income  considering the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies and the realizability of tax loss carryforwards 
valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes in tax law  changes in statutory tax rates and future levels of taxable income 
in the event the company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or a portion of its deferred tax assets in the future  the company would reduce such amounts through a charge to income in the period that such determination was made 
conversely  if the company was to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net carrying amounts  the company would decrease the recorded valuation allowance and record an increase to income in the period that such determination was made

unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries have been included in the consolidated financial statements without giving effect to the united states taxes that may be payable on the distribution to the united states because it is not anticipated such earnings will be remitted to the united states

in  the world trade organization wto ruled that the extraterritorial income program eti as provided for in the united states internal revenue code represents a prohibited export subsidy under the wto agreement on subsidies and countervailing measures 
as a result  the president of the united states has indicated that tax law will be changed to comply with the wto ruling 
during  the eti benefit decreased the company s effective tax rate by approximately percentage points 
at this time the company is unable to determine the impact that the potential changes to united states tax law will have on future financial results  however  it is possible that such changes will adversely affect the company s results of operations and cash flows in future periods
