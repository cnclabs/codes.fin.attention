o on may   we received a letter from the american stock exchange amex stating that we were now in compliance with amex listing standards 
o in may  we began the process of converting our installed base of ntn itv network customers from our one way satellite technology  fm  to our new two way vsat technology

this represented our second deployment with suscom as we had launched on their york  pennsylvania system in june o in july  we partially paid down and then replaced our revolving line of credit 
our previous lender  an asset based lender  had been seized by the fdic and our then existing million credit line had been purchased by a third party 
we successfully entered into a million revolving line of credit with a new bank 
o on july   we acquired the assets  certain liabilities and operations of breakaway international  inc  a privately held provider of restaurant industry hardware and software enterprise solutions 
o in december  comcast cable began to trial the buzztime channel at its cable television system in baltimore  maryland

critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to deferred costs and revenues  depreciation of broadcast equipment  bad debts  investments  intangible assets  financing operations  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
o we record deferred costs and revenues related to the costs and related installation revenue associated with installing new customer sites 
based on staff accounting bulletin sab  we amortize these amounts over an estimated three year average life of a customer relationship 
if a significant number of our customers leave us before the estimated life of each customer is attained  amortization of those deferred costs and revenues would accelerate  which would result in net incremental revenue 
o we incur a relatively significant level of depreciation expense in relationship to our operating income 
the amount of depreciation expense in any fiscal year is largely related to the estimated life of handheld  wireless playmaker devices and computers located at our customer sites 
the playmakers are depreciated over a four year life and the computers over a three year life 
the depreciable life of these assets was determined based upon their estimated useful life which considers anticipated technology changes 
if our playmakers and servers turn out to have a longer life  on average  than estimated  our depreciation expense would be significantly reduced in those future periods 
conversely  if the playmakers and servers turn out to have a shorter life  on average  than estimated  our depreciation expense would be significantly increased in those future periods 
o we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
the allowance is determined based on reserving for all customers that have terminated our service and all accounts over days past due  plus five percent of outstanding balances for all unreserved customer balances 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
o we assess our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory and write down the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future sales and supply on hand 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
o revenues from sales of software generally contain multiple elements  and are recognized in accordance with statement of position sop no 
 software revenue recognition  as amended 
along with the basic software license agreement purchase  customers generally are provided annual support and maintenance pcs for an additional fee based on a stipulated percentage of the license fee 
in order to continue to use the licensed software  customers are required to annually renew the pcs contracts 
as vendor specific objective evidence does not exist for this pcs  we recognize the entire arrangement fee ratably over the life of the contract 
revenue from development services consists of customizations and  therefore  we recognize revenue from development services as the services are performed under the agreements 
we recognize revenues from post contract customer support  such as maintenance  on a straight line basis over the term of the contract 
we do not have any of the following o off balance sheet arrangements  o certain trading activities that include non exchange traded contracts accounted for at fair value or speculative or hedging instruments  or o relationships and transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from any non independent relationship other than the related party transactions discussed in item certain relationships and related transactions or which are so non material to fall below the materiality threshold of such item

   buzztime    other    total    operating income loss ntn hospitality technologies division 
   buzztime    total    ntn hospitality technologies revenue is generated primarily from providing an interactive entertainment service which serves as a marketing and promotional vehicle for the hospitality industry  from its wireless business with restaurant on site paging systems  stored value gift cards and loyalty programs and electronic data managed comment cards and from its hardware and software enterprise solutions 
buzztime s revenue is primarily generated from the distribution of its digital trivia game show content and play along sports games as well as revenue related to production services for third parties and from performance under a trial agreement with a major cable operator 
results of operations following is a comparative discussion by fiscal year of the results of operations for the three years ended december  we believe that inflation has not had a material effect on the results of operations for the periods presented

media general investment on may   media general  inc  a communications company with interests in newspapers  television stations  interactive media and diversified information services  made a million investment in ntn 
in return for the investment  we issued and sold  shares of unregistered ntn common stock through a private offering to media general 
pursuant to the terms of the transaction  upon receipt of million from media general  we issued the unregistered shares along with fully vested warrants to purchase  shares of buzztime common stock at per share  exercisable through may  in connection with the buzztime common stock  the parties agreed that media general would have co sale rights and ntn would have certain drag along rights 
media general has the right to convert each share of buzztime common stock into two shares of ntn common stock subject to adjustment on the second and fourth anniversaries of the transaction date  in the event of a sale of ntn  upon certain bankruptcy and other insolvency proceedings of buzztime  and in certain circumstances if ntn exercises its drag along rights 
media general has the further right to convert the warrant to purchase  shares of buzztime common stock into a warrant to purchase  shares of ntn common stock at per ntn share subject to adjustment in the event of bankruptcy or insolvency of buzztime 
ntn has the right to require media general to convert its equity interests in buzztime into equity interests in ntn if there is a sale of ntn 
simultaneous with the transaction described above  we issued  shares of unregistered ntn common stock to license selected technology and content boxerjam games from media general to add additional game content to the buzztime interactive television game channel and the ntn network 
the license includes a year exclusive interactive television license of certain intellectual property  with options to extend the license for an additional years 
in september  we entered into an amendment to the boxerjam games license with media general pursuant to which we agreed to pay to media general a license fee in the amount of  or  more than the original amount of  in exchange for the unilateral right to exercise the option to extend the boxerjam games license for an additional years following the initial year term on a non exclusive basis 
previously  that non exclusive right was at media general s option

we used the publicly traded stock price  as of the date of the transactions  of per share to determine the  fair value of the shares issued 
the consideration allocated to the acquired boxerjam game license was valued at million and is being amortized over the estimated contractual life of years  which assumes  based on management s intention that we will exercise our five year renewal option 
we determined that  based on the lack of marketability of buzztime common stock and limited convertibility into ntn common stock  the fair value of the buzztime warrants was not material and no allocation of fair value was made 
breakaway international transaction on july   we acquired  through ntn software solutions  inc software solutions  a wholly owned subsidiary of ntn  all of the assets and certain liabilities of breakaway international  inc breakaway  a privately held provider of restaurant industry hardware and software enterprise solutions 
we acquired breakaway s assets for  in cash   shares of unregistered ntn common stock and the assumption of certain liabilities 
ntn will pay additional contingent earn out amounts in ntn common stock and or cash over the next three years  provided that certain targets for earnings before taxes are met for the acquired assets

ntn canada s results of operations have been included in our consolidated statements of operations since december january financing on january   we completed the sale of  shares of our common stock at per share  resulting in gross proceeds of approximately million  pursuant to an existing shelf registration filed under the securities act 
roth capital partners  llc acted as placement agent in the offering 
after commissions and expenses  the net proceeds of this offering are expected to be approximately million 
the offering was purchased primarily by a number of institutional investors and by media general  inc  a related party  which invested approximately million 
future financing needs in light of the recent completion of the january financing  it is unlikely that we will require additional financing in our capital requirements in will depend upon the growth of our two business units 
in either a low growth scenario for example  net site growth of sites in the ntn itv network and a couple of incremental commercial trials of the buzztime trivia channel or a more rapid growth scenario in either or both business units  utilization of our cash and existing line of credit is expected to be sufficient to cover our financing requirements for our liquidity and capital resources  while stronger than in recent years  remain limited and this may constrain our ability to operate and grow our business 
future capital investment for our new satellite network and for new site installations  cash used for acquisitions and expenditures for buzztime will likely cause our cash expenditures to exceed cash inflows  though we currently do not anticipate using more than million in based on the above low growth scenario 
we expect the level of expenditures in buzztime to increase over as we are field testing the channel with time warner in portland  maine and now with comcast cable in baltimore  maryland 
we also continue in the pre field testing phase with certain other cable operators 
if current buzztime channel sales efforts to cable msos the largest multiple system operators in the united states succeed as planned and we enter into additional field trials or national agreements with those cable operators  management intends to aggressively increase buzztime sales and marketing efforts to more quickly advance our distribution within the us market  which likely will require additional capital in and or we also believe that any additional success that buzztime achieves in entering into additional field trials with major cable system operators may enhance our ability to raise additional capital at favorable pricing  although there can be no assurance that will happen 
the ntn hospitality technologies division has transmitted its data through the fm satellite platform for more than ten years 
that arrangement is scheduled to end in february we have entered into equipment purchase and satellite service agreements to convert the division to a much higher speed  two way vsat very small aperture technology satellite technology over the two year period ending february these agreements are with the same reseller of satellite services that provided the fm satellite platform to us 
this anticipated conversion to a two way satellite technology will require a significant use of capital resources 
we believe that the conversion of our us customer locations may require incremental capital expenditures of up to million and increased cash operating expenses including estimated installation costs of up to million over the two year conversion period  which will lower our historical positive cash flow 
as of december   approximately of sites had been converted to vsat 
during the two year conversion period  we believe that this upgrade will have a moderately adverse impact on our earnings when compared with what earnings would have been without the expenditures 
the offsetting benefits of the installation include the elimination  at completion  of telecom costs that currently average approximately  per year and an expected increase of revenues from the sites 
we also believe that ntn canada will also require a significant amount of capital investment 
the previous owner did not convert the canadian customer base to ditv  so we plan to convert the customer base of approximately sites to both ditv and vsat over the next months 
this investment may be on the order of million 
however  we believe that the majority or perhaps all of the canadian capital expenditures will be financed through operating cash flow we generate in canada 
risk factors risk factors that may affect future results our business  results of operation and financial condition could be adversely affected by a number of factors  including the following we have experienced significant losses and we expect to incur significant net losses in the future 
we have a history of significant losses  including net losses of  in   in and  in  and an accumulated deficit of  as of december  we expect to incur significant operating and net losses for the next four quarters due primarily to our continued development of buzztime 
furthermore  we may never achieve profitability  and even if we do  we may not sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future 
our limited liquidity and capital resources may constrain our ability to operate and grow our business 
at december   our current assets exceeded our current liabilities by approximately  our liquidity and capital resources remain limited and this may constrain our ability to operate and grow our business 
we have a revolving line of credit agreement with pacific mercantile bank  which provides for borrowings of up to  and which was originally to expire in july by its terms 
effective january   we entered into an agreement with pacific mercantile to extend the maturity date of the line of credit to february  as of december    was outstanding under the line of credit 
the line of credit is secured by substantially all of our assets 
any reduction in availability under our line of credit may further constrain our liquidity 
in january  we completed an equity financing transaction resulting in gross proceeds to us of approximately million  pursuant to an existing shelf registration filed under the securities act 
we intend to use the funds to implement our plan to significantly expand the digital interactive television network  including our current two way satellite rollout  and to develop buzztime into a leading content provider for interactive television platforms 
in light of the recent completion of the january financing  it is unlikely that we will require additional financing in but we do not know if we will require additional financing in and beyond 
new products and rapid technological change may render our operations obsolete or noncompetitive 
if we do not compete successfully in the development of new products and keep pace with rapid technological change  we will be unable to achieve profitability or sustain a meaningful market position 
the interactive entertainment and game industry  as well as the wireless paging and software applications industries  are becoming highly competitive and subject to rapid technological changes when compared to other industries 
we are aware of other companies that are introducing interactive game products on various platforms that allow players to compete across the nation 
we are also aware of other companies that are developing and introducing wireless technology and software applications that may be suitable for use in the hospitality industry 
the wireless paging industry is highly competitive  we may experience pricing pressure in the wireless markets that could impact our margins with respect to our wireless product line 
some of these companies have substantially greater financial resources and organizational capital than we do  which could allow them to identify emerging trends 
in addition  changes in customer tastes may render our network and its content  our technology and our wireless and software products obsolete or noncompetitive 
the emergence of new entertainment products and technologies  changes in consumer preferences and other factors may limit the life cycle of our technologies and any future products and services we develop 
accordingly  our future performance will depend on our ability to o identify emerging technological trends in our market  o identify changing consumer needs  desires or tastes  o develop and maintain competitive technology  including new product and service offerings  o improve the performance  features and reliability of our products and services  particularly in response to technological changes and competitive offerings  and o bring technology to the market quickly at cost effective prices 
we may not be successful in developing and marketing new products and services that respond to technological and competitive developments and changing customer needs 
such products and services may not gain market acceptance 
any significant delay or failure in developing new or enhanced technology  including new product and service offerings  could result in a loss of actual or potential market share and a decrease in revenues 
we must effectively compete within the highly competitive software industry 
the software industry is intensely competitive 
several large vendors develop and market database management programs  business and management applications  collaboration products and business intelligence products that compete with our ntn software solutions offerings 
some of these competitors have significantly greater financial and technical resources than we do 
we expect to continue to face intense competition in the software market in which we compete 
we could lose market share if our competitors introduce new competitive products into one or more of our markets  add new functionality into an existing competitive product  acquire a competitive product  reduce prices  or form strategic alliances with other companies 
in addition  because new distribution methods and opportunities offered by the internet and electronic commerce have removed many of the barriers to entry historically faced by small and start up companies in the software industry  we expect to face additional future competition from these companies 
if we fail to manage our growth effectively  we may lose business and experience reduced profitability 
continued implementation of our business plan requires an effective planning and management process 
our anticipated future growth will continue to place a significant strain on our management systems and resources 
if we are to grow successfully  we must o improve our operational  administrative and financial systems  o expand  train and manage our workforce  and o attract and retain qualified management and technical personnel 
the interactive gaming and entertainment industry is highly competitive 
the entertainment business is highly competitive 
we compete with other companies for total entertainment related revenues in the marketplace 
our network programming competes generally with broadcast television  direct satellite programming  pay per view  other content offered on cable television  and other forms of entertainment 
furthermore  certain of our competitors have greater financial and other resources available to them 
the entrance of motion picture  cable and television companies in the interactive entertainment and multimedia industries will likely intensify competition in the future 
in january  the walt disney company introduced interactive programming broadcast in conjunction with live sporting and other events which competes directly with our programming 
we also compete with other content and services available to consumers through online services 
the expanded use of online networks and the internet provide computer users with an increasing number of alternatives to video games and entertainment software 
with this increasing competition and rapidly changing factors  we must be able to compete in terms of technology  content and management strategy 
if we fail to provide quality services and products  we will lose revenues to other competitors in the entertainment industry 
increased competition may also result in price reductions  fewer customer orders  reduced gross margins  longer sales cycles  reduced revenues and loss of market share 
if intellectual property law and practice do not adequately protect our proprietary rights and intellectual property  our business could be seriously damaged 
we rely on a combination of trademarks  copyrights and trade secret laws to protect our proprietary rights in some of our products 
furthermore  it is our policy that all employees and consultants involved in research and development activities sign nondisclosure agreements 
our competitors may  however  misappropriate our technology or independently develop technologies that are as good as or better than ours 
our competitors may also challenge or circumvent our proprietary rights 
if we have to initiate or defend against an infringement claim in the future to protect our proprietary rights  the litigation over such claims could be time consuming and costly to us  adversely affecting our financial condition 
from time to time  we hire or retain employees or external consultants who may work for other companies developing products similar to those offered by us 
these former employers may claim that our products are based on their products and that we have misappropriated their intellectual property 
any such litigation could prevent us from exploiting our proprietary portfolio and cause us to incur substantial costs  which in turn could materially adversely affect our business 
we believe that the success of our business depends upon such factors as the technical expertise  innovative skills and marketing and customer relations abilities of our employees  as well as upon patents  copyrights  trade secrets and other intellectual property rights 
as of december   we owned one united states patent covering certain aspects of technology related to an interactive learning system 
this patent will expire in as of december   we had applied for two additional patents in the united states 
our pending patent applications and any future applications might not be approved 
our patents might not provide us with competitive advantages 
third parties might challenge our patents 
in addition  patents held by third parties might have an adverse effect on our ability to do business 
furthermore  third parties might independently develop similar products  duplicate our products or  to the extent patents are issued to us  design around those patents 
others may have filed and in the future may file patent applications that are similar or identical to those of ours 
to determine the priority of inventions  we may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the united states patent and trademark office 
such interference proceedings could result in substantial cost to us 
such third party patent applications might have priority over patent applications filed by us 
we may be liable for the content we make available on the ntn itv network  the buzztime trivia channel and the internet 
we make content available on the ntn itv network  the buzztime trivia channel and the internet 
the availability of this content could result in claims against us based on a variety of theories  including defamation  obscenity  negligence or copyright or trademark infringement 
we could also be exposed to liability for third party content accessed through the links from our web sites to other web sites 
we may incur costs to defend ourselves against even baseless claims  and our financial condition could be materially adversely affected if we are found liable for information that we make available 
implementing measures to reduce our exposure may require us to spend substantial resources and may limit the attractiveness of our services to users 
we may face exposure on sales and or use taxes in various states 
from time to time  state tax authorities will make inquiries as to whether or not a portion of our services might require the collection of sales and use taxes from customers in those states 
in the current difficult economic climate  many states are expanding their interpretation of their sales and use tax statutes to derive additional revenue 
while in the past our sales and use tax expenses have not been material  it is likely that such expenses will grow in the future 
our games and game shows are subject to gaming regulations 
we operate games of skill and chance that  in some instances  reward prizes 
these games are regulated in many jurisdictions 
the selection of prizewinners is sometimes based on chance  although none of our games require any form of monetary payment 
the laws and regulations that govern these games  however  are subject to differing interpretations in each jurisdiction and are subject to legislative and regulatory change in any of the jurisdictions in which we offer our games 
if such changes were to happen  we may find it necessary to eliminate  modify or cancel certain components of our products that could result in additional development costs and or the possible loss of revenue 
we are currently involved in litigation matters that could materially impact our profitability 
we are involved in litigation in canada with interactive network  inc both ntn and interactive network  inc have asserted claims involving patent infringement and validity and certain other proprietary rights 
these actions relate only to the broadcast of the ntn itv network to subscribers in canada and do not extend to our network operations in the united states or elsewhere 
to date  interactive network  inc has deposited a total of  in canadian dollars with the canadian court in compliance with the court s order as security for costs to be incurred by us in defense of the action 
a trial date has been established for april we intend to continue to defend the action vigorously 
on march   long range systems  inc lrs filed in the united states district court  northern district of texas  a patent infringement complaint against ntn wireless 
this complaint alleged trade dress and patent infringement and unfair competition 
this complaint relates to our repair and replacement activities of lrs pagers  which is not a significant percentage of our ntn wireless business 
on may   we filed with the court a motion to dismiss the lrs complaint 
the court denied our motion to dismiss and provided lrs an opportunity to amend its complaint 
lrs served the amended complaint on july  and  in turn  we filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint 
in february  lrs amended their complaint to eliminate certain allegations relating to infringement of its utility patent for wireless pagers 
the court recently appointed a special master to the case 
the parties will commence discovery 
on or about april   we filed a complaint in the superior court of the state of california  county of san diego  against lrs alleging defamation and trade libel  intentional interference with prospective economic advantage  lanham act trademark violations and california unfair competition 
the case was subsequently transferred to the united states district court  southern district of california 
our complaint alleges that lrs made false statements in its complaint and press release regarding our products infringing lrs patents  that lrs intentionally made false statements to disrupt our business relationships with our clients  and that lrs registered the domain name www 
ntnwireless 
com in violation of our trademark rights 
lrs has recently agreed to transfer ownership of the www 
ntnwireless 
com domain name to us 
lrs filed a motion for change of venue seeking to have the matter transferred to texas and a motion to strike under california s anti slapp statute 
both motions remain pending the court s ruling 
the foregoing claims may not be decided in our favor and we are not insured against claims made 
during the pendency of these claims  we will continue to incur the costs of our legal defense 
if our chief executive officer were to leave us  our business may be adversely affected 
our success greatly depends on the efforts of our chief executive officer  stanley b 
kinsey 
our ability to operate successfully will depend significantly on his services and contributions 
mr 
kinsey s employment agreement with ntn was amended on may  to provide for an extended term ending january  as well as an increase in annual salary and a grant of options to purchase up to  shares of common stock 
mr 
kinsey is presently discussing an extension of his employment agreement with the compensation committee of our board of directors 
our business and operations may be adversely affected if he were to leave 
we may have difficulty recruiting professionals for our business 
our business requires experienced programmers  creative designers and application developers 
our success will depend on identifying  hiring  training and retaining such experienced  knowledgeable professionals 
we must recruit talented professionals in order for our business to grow 
there is significant competition for employees with the skills required to develop the products and perform the services we offer 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract a sufficient number of qualified employees in the future to sustain and grow our business  or that we will be successful in motivating and retaining the employees we are able to attract 
if we cannot attract  motivate and retain qualified professionals  our business  financial condition and results of operations will suffer 
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could harm our business 
on december  we acquired  through ntn canada  most of the operating assets  certain liabilities and the operations of ntnin from chell group corporation 
this acquisition added an additional customer sites that pay us in canadian dollars to use our interactive technology  and to receive our game service 
since both the service fees and our canadian subsidiary s operating expenses are recognized in canadian dollars  our financial results could be significantly affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates or by weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
risk factors associated with the ntn itv network we depend on a single supplier of playmakers r 
we currently purchase our mhz playmakers from climax technology co 
ltd  an unaffiliated taiwanese manufacturer 
we are currently soliciting bids from alternative suppliers for the manufacture of our playmakers 
unless and until we succeed in establishing additional manufacturing relationships  we will continue to depend on our current sole source supplier of playmakers 
if we lose our supplier  our growth may be slowed until an alternative supplier is identified 
communication failures with our subscriber locations could result in the cancellation of subscribers and a decrease in our revenues 
we rely on both satellite and telephone systems to communicate with our subscriber locations 
we currently transmit the majority of our data to our hospitality customer sites via panamsat s galaxy iiir satellite and will rely upon galaxy iiic for data transmission in connection with our new vsat two way communication technology 
we have currently converted of our sites to the vsat technology 
interruption in communications with our subscriber locations under either system could decrease customer loyalty and satisfaction and result in a cancellation of our services 
we are continually reviewing alternative telephone service providers and establishing contingency plans  however  such alternative providers and contingency plans have not been finalized 
in the event that we were forced to switch to another satellite  we would incur significant costs associated with re pointing our satellite receivers 
in addition  we could experience higher operating costs to transmit data to our customers via telephone lines and the internet during the transition period 
another potential risk is the possibility that our government could pre empt our satellite for national security reasons  as the united states satellite operators are federally licensed 
this would appear to be unlikely as our government has a strong communications infrastructure in place domestically 
risk factors associated with buzztime we may sell equity interests in buzztime to third parties  which could result in the loss of control of buzztime or devaluation of our equity interest in buzztime 
in june  we sold a interest in buzztime to an affiliate of scientific atlanta  a leading cable television set top box manufacturer 
while scientific atlanta s investment position was converted to our common stock in january  we believe there may be divergent investment preferences between the strategies pursued by the ntn itv network and buzztime and may decide in the future to continue to raise additional financing by issuing and selling equity interests in buzztime to third parties 
to enhance the ability of buzztime to raise such financing  we have previously contributed and may contribute in the future some of our assets to buzztime in order to allow the development of a distinct identity that we believe is necessary for it to effectively grow as a separate concern 
these assets include our extensive trivia game show library and our interactive play along sports games and related intangible assets 
from an operational standpoint  we could lose control of buzztime 
if we lose control  buzztime may no longer provide adequate support and resources for content and programming for the ntn itv network  affecting the ability of the ntn itv network to continue its operations 
from a financial viewpoint  we could undervalue the stock of buzztime when selling it to third parties or undervalue assets transferred to buzztime and this could devalue your holdings in ntn because we would not receive the fair value for our interest in buzztime 
if our new buzztime programming is not accepted by consumers  we are not likely to generate significant revenues or become profitable 
the new buzztime channel faces risks as to whether consumers will accept interactive television products and the trivia programming produced by buzztime 
if interactive television does not become a successful  scaleable medium or if consumers do not accept trivia and play along sports games  then we will be unable to draw revenues from advertising  direct marketing of third party products  subscription fees and pay per play fees 
until a sufficient market develops for the digital set top boxes enabled to run our interactive television game applications  our profit potential is uncertain and we may also face competition from companies developing and marketing stand alone game products and services 
we will also be unable to attract local cable operators to add buzztime programming as a channel to their service 
the market for interactive television games and services is new and may not develop as anticipated 
the interactive television market currently is small and emerging 
the success of buzztime will depend on the growth and development of this market in the united states and it will depend upon the commercialization and broad acceptance by consumers and businesses of a wide variety of interactive television products 
demand and market acceptance of recently introduced products and services are subject to a high level of uncertainty and  as a result  our profit potential is unproven 
in addition  the potential size of this new market opportunity and the timing of its development and deployment are currently uncertain 
development schedules of interactive television offered by our competitors have been delayed or refocused as the industry evolves 
if the market for interactive television does not develop or develops more slowly than anticipated  our revenues will not grow as fast as anticipated  if at all 
the adoption of incompatible standards could render our products obsolete or non competitive 
if a new digital set top box standard or middleware platform is defined  we do not know whether buzztime s products will be compatible with such standards once defined 
the establishment of multiple standards could hurt our business and significantly increase our expenses  particularly if our products require significant redevelopment in order to conform to the newly established standards 
any delay or failure on our part to respond quickly  cost effectively and sufficiently to these developments could render our existing products and services obsolete and cause us not to be competitive  resulting in a decrease in our revenues without a corresponding decrease in our expenses 
we may have to incur substantial expenditures to modify or adapt our products or services to respond to these developments 
we must be able to incorporate new technologies into the products we design and develop in order to address the increasingly complex and varied needs of our customer base 
increasing government regulation could cause demand for our products and services to decline significantly 
we are subject not only to regulations applicable to businesses generally  but also laws and regulations that apply directly to the industry of interactive television products 
although there are currently few such laws and regulations  state and federal governments may adopt a number of these laws and regulations governing any of the following issues o user privacy  o copyrights  o consumer protection  o the media distribution of specific material or content  and o the characteristics and quality of interactive television products and services 
one or more states or the federal government could enact regulations aimed at companies  like us  which provide interactive television products 
the likelihood of such regulation being enacted will increase as interactive television becomes more pervasive and affects the daily lives of more people 
any such legislation or regulation could dampen the growth of the industry of interactive television 
if such a reduction in growth occurs  demand for our products and services may decline significantly 
on january   the federal communications commission issued a notice of inquiry concerning interactive television 
the notice raised a series of questions that suggest that cable systems might be regarded as essential  open platforms of spectrum for non discriminatory third party access  rather than facilities based providers competing in a wider market 
the notice sought comments on the nature of interactive television and whether cable systems will be a superior platform for providing interactive television 
the outcome of the inquiry will determine whether or not a subsequent rulemaking will be held in order to create regulations for the interactive television industry 
any regulation of this industry could impact on buzztime and its operations 
risk factors associated with our common stock our common stock could be delisted or suspended from trading on the american stock exchange 
on may   we received a letter from the american stock exchange amex stating that we are now in compliance with amex listing standards 
prior to that date we had been out of compliance since our shareholders equity was below million  which was the minimum threshold established by amex for companies with multiple years of losses 
new amex rules effective january permit a company  such as ntn  to remain listed on amex if it has a total market capitalization of at least million  has at least million shares publicly held  has a market value of publicly held shares of at least million and has a minimum of round lot shareholders 
should  at some future date  we fall out of compliance with the new rules from subsequent changes in market capitalization or otherwise  we could remain compliant by maintaining a level of shareholder s equity of million 
if we otherwise fail to maintain compliance with the amex listing standards  our common stock may not remain listed on amex or any other exchange or quotation system in the future 
if our common stock is delisted from amex  spreads can often be higher for securities traded on the over the counter market and the execution time for orders may be longer 
thus  removing our stock from amex may result in decreased liquidity by making the trading of our stock less efficient 
our stock price has been highly volatile and your investment could suffer a decrease in value 
the trading price of our common stock has been and may continue to be subject to wide fluctuations 
our stock price may fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors  such as quarterly variations in operating results  announcements of technological innovations or new products and media properties by us or our competitors  changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts  the operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable  and news reports relating to trends in our markets 
in addition  the stock market in general  and the market prices for technology related companies in particular  have experienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
these broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the price of our stock  regardless of our operating performance 
our charter contains provisions that may hinder or prevent a change in control of our company  which could result in our inability to approve a change in control and potentially receive a premium over the current market value of your stock 
certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us  even if such a change in control would benefit our stockholders 
for example  our certificate of incorporation requires a supermajority vote of at least of the total voting power  voting together as a single class  to amend certain provisions of such document  including those provisions relating to o the number  election and term of directors  o the removal of directors and the filling of vacancies  and o the supermajority voting requirements of our restated certificate of incorporation 
these provisions could discourage third parties from taking over control of our company 
such provisions may also impede a transaction in which you could receive a premium over then current market prices and your ability to approve a transaction that you consider in your best interests 
if the shares of our common stock eligible for future sale are sold  the market price of our common stock may be adversely affected 
future sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market or the anticipation of such sales could have a material adverse effect on then prevailing market prices 
as of december   there were approximately  shares of common stock reserved for issuance upon the exercise of outstanding stock options at exercise prices ranging from to per share 
as of december   there were also outstanding warrants to purchase an aggregate of approximately  shares of common stock at exercise prices ranging from to per share 
the foregoing options and warrants could adversely affect our ability to obtain future financing or engage in certain mergers or other transactions  since the holders of these options and warrants can be expected to exercise them at a time when we would be able to obtain additional capital through a new offering of securities on terms more favorable than those provided by such options and warrants 
for the life of such options and warrants  the holders are given the opportunity to profit from a rise in the market price of our common stock without assuming the risk of ownership 
to the extent the trading price of our common stock at the time of exercise of any such options or warrants exceeds the exercise price  such exercise will have a dilutive effect on our stockholders 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to risks related to currency exchange rates  stock market fluctuations  and interest rates 
as of december   we owned common stock of an australian company that is subject to market risk 
at december   the carrying value of this investment was  which is net of a  unrealized loss 
this investment is exposed to further market risk in the future based on the operating results of the australian company and stock market fluctuations 
additionally  the value of the investment is further subject to changes in australian currency exchange rates 
at december   a hypothetical decline in the value of the australian dollar would result in a reduction of  in the carrying value of the investment 
we do not have any derivative financial instruments 
nor do we have any speculative or hedging instruments
