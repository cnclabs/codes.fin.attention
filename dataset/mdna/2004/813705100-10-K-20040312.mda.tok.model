revenue 
our revenue increased to million in  up from million in the increase in revenue in was driven by growth across all product lines 
our sidewinder g firewall product line revenue increase was due to demand for our next generation firewall released in early our web filtering product line revenue increase was due to continued traction through our oem relationships and the incremental bess and sentian revenue contributed as a result of the nh  inc acquisition late in the year 
our safeword product lines revenue increase was driven by sustained demand for high assurance solutions 
we expect revenue to grow over driven by increasing our focus on channel partnerships  the launch of the sidewinder g security appliance line  our expanding safeword and smartfilter product lines  and the full year contribution of the bess and sentian product lines 
gross profit 
gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased from in to in this decline was driven by increased sales volume on products containing a hardware component  primarily the sidewinder appliance sales  which have a lower gross profit margin than our software products 
aggregate gross margins in are expected to be consistent with the that was achieved for  based on our current revenue mix projections 
operating expenses

we believe it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized based on historical earnings  expected levels of future taxable income in the us and certain foreign jurisdictions  and the implementation of tax planning strategies 
future taxable income of million is required to realize the million deferred tax asset at december  we had total net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million at december  of these carryforwards  million relates to stock option exercises  which currently have a full valuation allowance  and when realized for financial statement purposes will not result in a reduction in income tax expense 
rather  the benefit will be recorded as an increase to additional paid in capital 
of the remaining benefit associated with the carryforwards  approximately million have yet to be recognized as a benefit in the consolidated statement of operations

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion of the financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of any contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
management regularly reviews its estimates and assumptions  which are based on historical factors and other factors that are believed to be relevant under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions  estimates  or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies 
revenue recognition 
our revenue is derived from sales of our software licenses  hardware  royalties and maintenance arrangements to provide product upgrades and customer support 
we recognize revenue in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as modified by sop revenue from products is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collection is probable 
maintenance revenue for providing product upgrades and customer support is deferred and recognized ratably over the service period 
for arrangements with multiple elements we allocate revenue to the various elements based on the fair value of each element sold 
we determine the fair value of each element based on its selling price when sold separately 
evidence of fair value includes the approved price list and discount schedule and the actual prices charged for comparable arrangements 
these price lists and discount schedules may change from time to time in response to factors including market conditions  value of services and product provided and competitive positioning 
historically  we have not offered significant discounts off of our list prices 
further  it is our policy that our distributors and resellers are not allowed to hold inventory 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we make estimates regarding the collectibility of our accounts receivables 
when we evaluate the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts  we closely analyze specific accounts receivable balances  customer creditworthiness  changes in our customer payment cycles  and current economic trends 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
valuation of long lived assets  including goodwill and other intangible assets 
intangible assets consist of patents  trademarks  capitalized software costs  a purchased customer list  a purchased control list  capitalized developed technology and goodwill  all of which are recorded at cost or fair value 
patents  trademarks  customer and control lists  and capitalized developed technology are amortized using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets  which range up to years 
see accounting policy of capitalized software costs under research and development in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
goodwill is not amortized  but is tested for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level 
if impairment is indicated  a write down is recorded as an impairment loss in income from operations 
we review our long lived assets and finite lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable  except for goodwill as noted above 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
deferred tax assets 
the computations of our deferred tax assets and valuation allowance are based on taxable income we expect to earn on sales of existing products and projected interest and other income over the next three years 
the amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income are reduced 
sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires the consideration of a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that benefits of deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we believe it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets of million at december  will be realized 
however  the amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income are reduced 
inflation to date  we have not been significantly affected by inflation 

table of contents recently issued accounting standards in january  the fasb issued fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
in addition  on december   the fasb issued a revision of fin the revised interpretation 
the revised interpretation addresses consolidation of business enterprises of variable interest entities and is effective for variable interest entities for the first fiscal year or interim period ending after march  we do not expect the adoption of fin to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
this statement establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures in its statement of financial position certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
in accordance with the standard  financial instruments that embody obligations for the issuer are required to be classified as liabilities 
this statement shall be effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may  and otherwise shall be effective beginning in our first quarter of fiscal year the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial position 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we develop products in the united states and sell them worldwide 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
since our sales are currently priced in us dollars  a strengthening of the dollar could make our products less competitive in foreign markets and our accounts receivable more difficult to collect 
we invest our cash in a variety of financial instruments  including bank time deposits and commercial paper 
investments in fixed rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have seen a decline in market value due to changes in interest rates 
our investment securities are held as available for sale
