the market continues to pose challenges as semiconductor sales volumes continue to be affected by the prolonged downturn impacting the semiconductor industry 
however  increased customer bookings are beginning to show an indication of an improvement in the level of inventory held by customers 
revenue in fiscal decreased by  or  from revenue in fiscal the decrease in revenue was due to lower sales volumes  caused by the continued downturn in the semiconductor industry  in the consumer communications segment  principally in cellular wireless  and in the audiologic component market within the ultra low power communications segment 
in fiscal  the company recorded a net loss from continuing operations of  or per share 
this compares to a net loss from continuing operations of  or per share  in fiscal the fiscal net loss was primarily a result of lower revenue due to the continued downturn in the semiconductor industry  as well as restructuring costs incurred as a result of the industry downturn 
during the year  severance costs of were recorded as the company reduced its headcount in all areas 
in addition  the net loss included of asset impairment and other restructuring costs 
in fiscal  the company recorded a net loss from continuing operations of  or per share 
the fiscal net loss included a recovery of stock compensation expense of  as well as an non cash write down of its investment in mitel networks corporation and the impact of settling a defined benefit pension plan in the united kingdom 
the company also incurred of mostly non cash foreign exchange charges  principally related to holding significant us dollar cash balances in the canadian parent company

network communications millions of us dollars revenue as a of total revenue operating loss zarlink s network communications products provide connectivity to the enterprise and metropolitan markets through feeder  aggregation and transmission applications and products that address the multi protocol physical and network layers 
in simple terms  network communications semiconductor products connect network equipment 
revenue for fiscal totaled  down from in fiscal and from in fiscal revenue continued to be adversely affected by customer and channel inventory adjustments  a trend that began during the second half of fiscal and continued through fiscal revenue declines primarily resulted from decreased sales volumes of the company s packet switching and specialty products  partially offset by an increase in sales volumes of optical communication products 
the segment s operating loss increased to in fiscal from an operating loss of in fiscal  and decreased from an operating loss of in fiscal the increase in net loss in fiscal was due mainly to of asset impairments and other restructuring costs  partially offset by the results of cost control initiatives and lower r d spending 
during fiscal  the network communications segment also incurred approximately of severance costs 
the fiscal results of the network communications segment were adversely affected by lower sales volumes due to the downturn in the semiconductor industry 
in addition  the segment recorded an excess inventory charge of in cost of revenue for inventories estimated to be beyond its needs for the following months 
despite the above market conditions  the network communications segment continued its significant investment in research and development to develop and launch new products 
the impact of new products on revenue in the year of introduction is not normally significant  however management believes that new product introductions are critical to supporting future revenue growth 
during fiscal  the company continued to secure design wins and introduced new products to the market  up from new products introduced in fiscal and in fiscal consumer communications millions of us dollars revenue as a of total revenue operating loss zarlink s consumer communications products allow users to connect to the network 
these products include wireless for example  cellular chipsets and infotainment applications for example  set top boxes and digital tv 
revenue for fiscal totaled  up from in fiscal  but down from in fiscal fiscal revenue increases resulted primarily from increased shipments of the company s tuners and demodulators  partially offset by decreased sales volumes of the segment s specialty products 
fiscal revenue decreases resulted from lower sales volumes of the company s tuners and wireless products caused by the continued downturn in the semiconductor industry 
the segment s operating loss totaled in fiscal  up from operating losses of in fiscal and in fiscal the increase in operating loss from fiscal to fiscal was partially due to asset impairments and severance costs of and  respectively  as well as lower margins resulting from increasing price pressure on certain of the company s tuners 
these impacts were partially offset by increases in revenue 
the increase in operating loss from fiscal to fiscal resulted primarily from lower sales volumes during fiscal in addition  the fiscal results were adversely affected by an excess inventory charge of to cost of revenue for inventories estimated to be beyond its needs for the following months 
the consumer communications segment continues to invest in research and development to expand its new product portfolio of wireless and set top box semiconductor solutions 
during fiscal  the company continued to secure design wins and introduced seven new products to the market  in addition to the ten new products introduced in fiscal and nine in fiscal ultra low power communications millions of us dollars revenue as a of total revenue operating income loss zarlink s ultra low power communications business provides asic and assp solutions for applications such as pacemakers  hearing aids  portable instruments and personal area communications devices 
fiscal ultra low power communications sales of were up from in fiscal and up from in fiscal fiscal revenue increased due predominantly to improved shipments of the company s hearing aid and wireless products 
the decline in revenue between fiscal and resulted from higher customer inventories and reduced demand in the analog audiologic business 
the segment s operating loss improved to in fiscal from an operating loss of in fiscal  and declined from operating income of in fiscal the fiscal improvements resulted primarily from a more favorable product mix and increased margins  and savings resulting from cost control initiatives 
these favorable impacts were partially offset by in severance costs and asset impairment and other costs of fiscal operating results declined from fiscal due to lower revenues and a weaker product mix resulting in lower gross margins 
during fiscal  the ultra low power communications group introduced six new products in addition to the seven new products introduced in fiscal and the seven new products introduced in fiscal geographic revenue revenue from continuing operations  based on the geographic location of customers  was distributed as follows millions of us dollars of total of total of total asia pacific europe united states canada other regions total for the year ended march   there was no impact of the net movement in exchange rates on the company s revenue  as a result of the company changing its functional currency to the us dollar at the end of the prior fiscal year 
for the year ended march   the net movement in exchange rates from fiscal favorably impacted total revenue from continuing operations by 
asia pacific sales in the asia pacific region increased by in fiscal compared to fiscal  and continue to represent the largest geographic segment of customer revenues 
sales in this region improved due to increased volumes of tuners and demodulators shipped within the consumer communications segment  partially offset by decreased sales of packet switching and specialty products in the network communications segment 
asia pacific sales in fiscal increased by compared to fiscal due to higher product sales within the network communications segment resulting from market improvements primarily within the company s tdm switching  timing  and specialty product lines 
in addition  the company experienced increased shipments of tuners and demodulators in the consumer communications segment 
ultra low power communications sales in asia pacific decreased in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  due primarily to lower sales of the company s hearing aid products 
europe european sales decreased by in fiscal from fiscal due primarily to lower sales of the company s specialty products within the network communications and consumer communications segments 
these declines were partially offset by sales improvements of audiologic products in ultra low power communications segment 
fiscal sales into europe decreased by from fiscal due primarily to lower sales of network communications and consumer communications products caused by the downturn in the semiconductor industry 
united states sales into the united states increased by in fiscal from fiscal the increase was due predominantly to higher sales of audiologic and wireless products in the ultra low power communications segment  and increased shipments of wireless products within the consumer communications segment 
sales decreased by in the united states in fiscal from fiscal the decrease was due to lower product sales  predominantly in the consumer communications segment and also in the ultra low power communications segments caused by the downturn in the semiconductor industry 
canada canadian sales decreased by in fiscal from fiscal  and by in fiscal from fiscal due primarily to declining sales of the company s legacy products in the network communications segment 
other regions sales into other regions decreased by in fiscal compared with fiscal  and increased by in fiscal as compared to fiscal gross margin millions of us dollars gross margin as a of total revenue the company s gross margin as a percentage of revenue was for the year ended march   compared to in fiscal the gross margin declines in fiscal compared to fiscal were attributable to the increased proportion of consumer communications products in the overall mix 
margins in the consumer communications segment were also lower due to price pressure on the company s tuners 
gross margin also included severance costs of  as the company continues its outsourcing initiatives 
these impacts were partially offset by more favorable product mixes in the ultra low power and network communications segments 
the fiscal gross margin was favorably impacted by one percentage point principally due to selling previously written down network communications inventory 
the improvement was partially offset by severance costs of related to cost reductions undertaken within the operations group 
the higher gross margin in fiscal compared to fiscal was attributable to lower overall manufacturing costs  and a favorable product mix in the network communications and consumer communications segments 
in addition  fiscal gross margin was adversely impacted by a inventory obsolescence charge to cost of revenue 
margins were also lower in fiscal due to the declining sales volumes of network communications and consumer communications products and the associated negative manufacturing variances resulting from lower plant utilization

prior to march   the company incurred additional severance and benefit costs of related to the termination of employees throughout the world 
in addition  the special charge in the fourth quarter included the cost of excess space in ottawa  canada of approximately the company also reviewed the carrying value of certain manufacturing assets in the year ended march  based on an analysis of estimated future undiscounted cash flows resulting from changes in the expected use of these fixed assets  the company determined that the carrying value of these fixed assets was impaired and recorded a write down of the company also recorded a write down of in the year ended march   related to the economic uncertainty of certain long term investments held at cost 
the fourth quarter special charge was net of a reversal of from the first quarter restructuring provision that was no longer required 
the reversal was due to savings on the workforce reduction program and to the subsequent sub letting of vacant space in irvine  california just after the close of fiscal amortization of acquired intangibles amortization of acquired intangibles was nil in fiscal and fiscal and in fiscal the remaining acquired intangibles  including goodwill  resulting from the acquisition of vertex on july   were expensed in fiscal the fiscal expense was comprised of regular amortization of and an accelerated write down of associated with the impairment of other acquired intangibles to reduce the carrying value to nil as at march  other income expense in fiscal  other income was  as compared to an expense of in fiscal and income of in fiscal other income expense was comprised of interest income  foreign exchange gains and losses  and other non operating gains and losses 
interest income was for the year ended march  as compared to in fiscal and in fiscal the year over year decreases from fiscal to fiscal were due to lower average cash balances on hand and to lower interest rates 
foreign exchange losses in fiscal amounted to loss of  gain of 
in fiscal  net losses were recorded on monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar functional currency  and according to month end market rates 
during fiscal  there was a net decrease in earnings due to the foreign exchange revaluation of short term investments held in currencies other than the functional currency of the parent company

interest expense interest expense was for fiscal  compared with and for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
interest expense relates primarily to financing costs related to the company s pension plan in sweden and interest on capital leases 
income taxes the company s effective tax rate is based on pre tax income  statutory tax rates and tax planning strategies available to it in the various jurisdictions in which it operates 
in determining net income  significant management judgment is required in determining the company s effective tax rate  in evaluating its tax position and in determining the recoverability of deferred tax assets that arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenues and expenses 
the company establishes reserves when  despite its belief that its tax return positions are supportable  it believes these positions may be challenged 
the company adjusts these reserves as warranted by changing facts and circumstances 
although the company believes its estimates are reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different than what is reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accruals 
a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which the company has established a reserve is audited and finally resolved 
the number of years for which the company has audits that are open varies depending on the tax jurisdiction 
while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of the resolution  the company believes that its reserves reflect the probable outcome of known tax contingencies 
favorable resolutions would be recognized as a reduction of its tax expense in the year of resolution 
unfavorable resolutions would be recognized as a reduction to its reserves  a cash outlay for settlement and a possible increase to its annual tax provision 
such differences could have a material impact on the income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made 
income tax recovery for fiscal was  compared with an income tax expense of for fiscal and a recovery of for fiscal the tax recovery in fiscal was due primarily to tax recoveries on current year losses  tax refunds received  and changes in management estimates of future tax recoveries and probable outcomes on historical tax filings based on settlement of past audits  passage of time  and tax losses accumulated during our most recent fiscal years 
the tax expense in fiscal was mainly comprised of canadian income and capital taxes 
the recovery in fiscal was principally due to the loss on sale of the cmos foundry in bromont  canada 
during the year  the company received tax refunds in excess of its original provision estimates in both its domestic and foreign operations 
these amounts were booked as tax recoveries during the year 
the refunds account for of the income tax recovery 
based on its periodic review  management determined that an adjustment was required to its income tax provision  and deferred tax asset balances  in the fourth quarter of fiscal these adjustments were based upon an overall assessment of the settlements of past audits  passage of time in certain jurisdictions  and tax losses incurred in its domestic operations 
based upon this assessment  the company recorded an income tax recovery of related to the adjustment of these income tax accruals 
in addition  based upon consideration of recent losses  the company recorded a deferred income tax expense of related to an increase in the valuation allowance on the company s investment tax credits in canada  resulting in a net income tax recovery of booked during the year 
the remaining relates to income taxes recoverable for tax loss carrybacks  net of current year taxes paid 
in fiscal  zarlink s effective tax rate was a recovery of 
this rate was lower than the domestic tax rate due to unrecorded temporary differences and losses incurred during the year net of the recoveries discussed above 
the company s effective tax rate was an expense of in fiscal this tax rate was lower than the domestic tax rate due to unrecorded temporary differences and losses incurred during the year 
in fiscal  zarlink s effective tax rate was a recovery of 
this tax rate was lower than the domestic tax rate primarily due to unrecorded temporary differences and losses incurred during fiscal the company had a valuation allowance at the end of fiscal of fiscal  fiscal 
management has determined that sufficient uncertainties continue to exist regarding the realization of certain of its deferred tax assets and consequently a valuation allowance is required to reduce the recorded value of these assets 
the increase in the allowance relates mainly to unrecorded investment tax credits  losses  and reversing deductible temporary differences incurred in fiscal in the company s domestic and foreign jurisdictions 
discontinued operations communications systems business systems during fiscal  the company concluded the sale of the systems business to dr 
terence h 
matthews for net proceeds of  after adjustments  in exchange for selling a ownership interest in the company s communications systems business and most of its real property in ottawa  canada 
during fiscal the company recorded an adjustment of related to a tax recovery on discontinued operations  resulting from management s revision of estimates based on the closure of audit years in certain foreign jurisdictions 
during fiscal  and on the second anniversary of the sale of the systems business  the company recorded a recovery of related to the reversal of excess provisions based upon remaining costs to settle claims 
there were no discontinued operations included in the results of operations for the year ended march  net loss the company recorded a net loss of  or per share in fiscal this compares to a net loss of  or per share  in fiscal in fiscal  net loss was  or per share 
the net loss in fiscal was mainly due to lower revenue caused by the continued downturn in the semiconductor industry  as well as the impairment and restructuring expenses discussed elsewhere in this management discussion and analysis 
the net loss in fiscal was mainly due to lower revenue  caused by the continued industry downturn  and to non operating charges described and included in other expense 
the fiscal net loss resulted primarily from lower revenue due to the communications industry downturn  which in turn led to a charge for excess inventory of and special charges of the loss also included the loss on sale of the bromont foundry business  stock compensation expense of  and the impairment of the company s equity investment in optenia amounting to liquidity and capital resources at march   cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and restricted cash balances totaled  down from at march  cash and cash equivalents at march   included in the amount above  were cash used in operating activities during fiscal was as compared to during fiscal cash flow used in operations before changes in working capital was during fiscal compared to cash flow used in operations of during fiscal the decrease in cash flow used in operations during fiscal mainly resulted from improved operating earnings compared to fiscal since march   the company s working capital  as reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows  increased by  mostly due to the reduction of accounts payable and accrued liabilities and increases in accounts receivable and prepaid expenses  caused by the timing of cash receipts and payments during the year 
this was partially offset by a reduction in inventory levels 
management expects to further draw down inventory levels in fiscal by reducing cycle times and managing inventories on a build to order basis 
in comparison  the company s working capital decreased by during fiscal  mostly due to the reduction of inventories and improved cash collections from trade receivables 
this was offset by reductions of trade accounts payable and other accrued liabilities  increases in prepaid expenses  and on the settlement of certain pound sterling denominated hedge contracts 
cash provided from investing activities was for the year ended march  compared to cash used of used during fiscal the net cash inflow from investing activities during fiscal primarily resulted from net sales of short term investments totaling  and proceeds upon disposal of certain fixed assets of this increase was partially offset by purchases of fixed and other assets totaling the fixed asset additions were primarily related to test equipment and continuing improvements to existing information technology resources 
capital expenditures declined in fiscal as compared with fiscal management expects fiscal capital spending to remain consistent with fiscal levels 
in addition  proceeds of were received upon sale of the company s investment in a privately held company 
the cash outflow from investing activities during fiscal was primarily the result of net purchases of short term investments totaling cash balances were also reduced by purchases of fixed and other assets totaling  offset by proceeds of from the disposal of certain fixed assets 
the fixed asset additions were primarily related to design tools and continuing improvements to information technology resources 
capital expenditures declined significantly in fiscal when compared with fiscal a net reduction of long term investments of in fiscal resulted from cash proceeds of received as a result of the sale of the company s minority investment in dalsa  offset by a small investment purchased during the year 
cash used in financing activities during fiscal totaled the cash outflow was primarily the result of an increase in restricted cash of during fiscal  cash and cash equivalents of were hypothecated under the company s credit facility to cover outstanding letters of credit 
the company also pledged as a security for a custom bond and related credit facilities 
in addition  cash outflows resulted from the repayment of capital lease liabilities in the amount of  the repurchase of of the company s redeemable preferred shares  and the payment of for dividends on the preferred shares 
a cash inflow of was received from the issuance of new common shares upon the exercise of stock options 
during fiscal  cash flows used in financing activities totaled  primarily as a result of an payment to settle the company s defined benefit pension plan in the united kingdom 
during fiscal  the company also hypothecated of cash and cash equivalents under its revolving global credit facility to cover outstanding letters of credit 
the repayment of capital lease liabilities in the amount of  the repurchase of of the company s redeemable preferred shares  and the payment of for dividends on the preferred shares also negatively impacted cash flows 
these cash outflows were offset by received from the issuance of new common shares upon the exercise of stock options 
during fiscal  the company took steps to wind up its defined benefit pension plan in the united kingdom and replaced it with a defined contribution plan 
the company expects to make a final payment of approximately in fiscal after the final adjustments are calculated 
this amount was included in other accrued liabilities as at march  on june   the company announced its board of directors had authorized the continuation of its normal course issuer bid program to repurchase and cancel up to  common shares  over a twelve month period beginning on june  and ending on june  no common shares were repurchased under the renewed program for the year period ended june   or under the previous program during the period from june  to june  the program expired on june  and was not renewed by the company 
as at march   the company had not met a quarterly financial covenant with respect to shareholder s equity under the company s credit facility  as a result of restructuring and impairment losses recorded during the year 
a waiver was obtained from the bank in respect of the financial covenant 
during fiscal  the company cancelled the operating line component of its revolving global credit facility  as it was not being utilized or required by the company 
this resulted in reducing the total credit facility from cdn to a facility of cdn available for letters of credit 
in addition  the financial covenant with respect to the shareholder s equity was modified under the new agreement such that no waiver was required as at march  as at march   cash and cash equivalents totaling were hypothecated under the credit facility to cover outstanding letters of credit 
of this amount  was issued to secure letters of credit related to the company s pension plan in sweden  and of letters of credit were outstanding related to the company s supplementary executive retirement plan serp plan 
in addition  was issued to secure certain obligations under a performance guarantee and office lease arrangement 
the company has also pledged as a security for a custom bond and related credit facilities 
the credit facilities are subject to periodic review  including the determination of certain financial covenants 
it is uncertain if the company will be able to meet these financial covenants in the future and  if not  to obtain a waiver from the bank  which may result in the availability of the credit facility being reduced or restricted 
management does not anticipate that this would have a material adverse effect on the financial position of the company 
management believes the company is in a position to meet all foreseeable business cash requirements and capital lease and preferred share payments from its cash balances on hand  existing financing facilities and cash flow from operations

commitments and guarantees performance guarantees performance guarantees are contracts that contingently require the guarantor to make payments to the guaranteed party based on another entity s failure to perform under an obligating agreement 
the company has an outstanding performance guarantee related to a managed services agreement project agreement undertaken by the discontinued systems business  which was sold to companies controlled by dr 
terence h 
matthews on february  and is now operated as mitel networks corporation mitel 
this performance guarantee remained with the company following the sale of the systems business to dr 
matthews 
the project agreement and the company s performance guarantee extend until july  the terms of the project agreement continue to be fulfilled by mitel 
the maximum potential amount of future undiscounted payments the company could be required to make under the guarantee at may   was british pounds  assuming the company is unable to secure the completion of the project 
the company is not aware of any factors that would prevent the project s completion under the terms of the agreement 
in the event that mitel is unable to fulfill the commitments of the project agreement  the company believes that an alternate third party contractor could be secured to complete the agreement requirements 
the company has not recorded a liability in its consolidated financial statements associated with this guarantee 
the company periodically has entered into agreements with customers and suppliers that include limited intellectual property indemnifications that are customary in the industry 
these guarantees generally require the company to compensate the other party for certain damages and costs incurred as a result of third party intellectual property claims arising from these transactions 
the nature of the intellectual property indemnification obligations prevents the company from making a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount it could be required to pay to its customers and suppliers 
historically  the company has not made any significant indemnification payments under such agreements and no amount has been accrued in the accompanying consolidated financial statements with respect to these indemnification obligations 
in connection with the sale of the systems business described in note  the company provided to the purchaser certain income tax indemnities with an indefinite life and with no maximum liability for the taxation periods up to february   the closing date of the sale 
as at march   the taxation years to february  are subject to audit by taxation authorities in certain foreign jurisdictions 
as at march   the company has provided security to the financial institution of a subsidiary in the form of a guarantee amounting to in relation to the subsidiary s liabilities for custom and excise duties 
supply agreements the company has wafer supply agreements with three independent foundries  which expire from to under these agreements  the suppliers are obligated to provide certain quantities of wafers per year 
none of the agreements have minimum unit volume purchase requirements 
backlog the company s day backlog as at march  was 
generally  manufacturing lead times for semiconductor products are longer because of the nature of the production process 
however  as orders are sometimes booked and shipped within the same fiscal quarter often referred to as turns  order backlog is not necessarily indicative of a sales outlook for the quarter or year 
backlog increased from the prior quarter due to increased bookings across the consumer and network communications segments 
the comparative backlog amount has been adjusted to reflect the company s revised methodology of applying distributor stock rotations and allowances against distributor orders at the time of booking 
the revised methodology better matches order backlog with the net sales recorded at the time of shipment 
other critical accounting policies and significant estimates the company s consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies  which require management to make significant estimates and assumptions 
management believes that the following are some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of accounting policies that currently affect zarlink s financial condition and results of operations 
in general  any changes in estimates or assumptions relating to revenue recognition  provisions for inventory  and provisions for restructuring are directly reflected in the results of our reportable operating segments 
changes in estimates or assumptions pertaining to income tax asset valuations are not reflected in our reportable operating segments  but are reflected on a consolidated basis 
management has discussed the application of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the company s board of directors and with the full board of directors 
this review is conducted annually 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable  risk of loss has passed to the customer and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
the company s semiconductor products are primarily non commodity  specialized products that are proprietary in design and used by multiple customers 
customer acceptance provisions for performance requirements are generally based on seller specified criteria  which we demonstrate prior to shipment 
should management determine that these customer acceptance provisions are not met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for future reporting periods could be affected 
inventory the company periodically compares its inventory levels to revenue forecasts for the future twelve months on a part by part basis and records a charge for inventory on hand in excess of the estimated twelve month demand 
during the first quarter of fiscal  the company s inventory of network communications and consumer communications products exceeded the estimated month demand by as a result of the industry downturn to result in a charge of the same amount 
if future demand for the company s products continues to decline  an additional write down of inventory may be necessary 
restructuring the company has undertaken  and may in the future undertake  restructuring initiatives which have required the development of formalized plans for exiting certain activities 
all restructuring charges have been accounted for in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
eitf  liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring  and statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  depending on the time of the restructuring activity 
these activities require estimation of the cost and timing of expenses for lease cancellations  severance  and other restructuring costs 
given the significance  complexity and the timing of the execution of such activities  management periodically reassesses the assumptions used and estimates made upon initial recognition of the costs 
although management does not anticipate significant changes  actual costs may differ from these estimates 
during fiscal  the company continued to reduce its workforce and incurred and paid severance costs of reductions were performed globally across all job categories and business units 
during fiscal  zarlink reduced its workforce across all geographic regions and withdrew from the vdsl market in order to concentrate its r d resources on higher and more immediate growth opportunities 
as a result  the company incurred and paid severance costs of during fiscal  the company recorded significant reserves in connection with a restructuring program 
these reserves included estimates pertaining to employee separation costs and the settlements of contractual obligations resulting from our actions 
although management does not anticipate significant changes  the actual costs may differ from these estimates 
income taxes the company is subject to income taxes in canada  sweden  the united kingdom  the united states and numerous other foreign jurisdictions 
the effective tax rate is based on pre tax income  statutory tax rates and available tax planning strategies 
in determining net income  significant management judgment is required in determining the effective tax rate  in evaluating the tax position and in the recoverability of deferred tax assets that arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenues and expenses 
the company has recorded a valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets  and recorded only deferred tax assets that can be applied against income in taxable jurisdictions or applied against deferred tax liabilities that will reverse in the future 
in establishing the appropriate valuation allowance for tax loss carry forwards and investment tax credits  it is necessary to consider all available evidence  both positive and negative 
management periodically reviews the company s provision for income taxes and valuation allowance to determine whether the overall tax estimates are reasonable 
when management performs its quarterly assessments of the provision and valuation allowance  it may be determined that an adjustment is required 
this adjustment may have a material impact on the company s financial position and results of operations 
based on its periodic review  management determined that an adjustment was required to its income tax provision  and deferred tax asset balances  in the fourth quarter of fiscal these adjustments were based upon an overall assessment of the settlements of past audits  passage of time in certain jurisdictions  and tax losses incurred in its domestic operations 
based upon this assessment  the company recorded an income tax recovery of related to the adjustment of these income tax accruals 
in addition  based upon consideration of recent losses  the company recorded a deferred income tax expense of related to an increase in the valuation allowance on the company s investment tax credits in canada  resulting in a net income tax recovery of booked during the year 
long lived assets the company evaluates the recoverability of property  plant and equipment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
management assesses the impairment of long lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets or the asset groupings may not be recoverable 
in assessing the impairment  the company compares projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over their estimated remaining useful life against their carrying amounts 
if projected undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of the assets  the assets are written down to their estimated fair values based on expected discounted cash flows 
changes in the estimates and assumptions used in assessing projected cash flows could materially affect the results of management s evaluation 
as a result of the restructuring activities incurred in the year ended march   the company recorded an asset impairment charge of resulting from a review of the usage of the company s testing equipment and enterprise resource planning system 
in addition  the company recorded a charge of on patent assets  as management had assessed that it was no longer possible to reasonably forecast significant cash flows expected to be saved or generated related to these assets 
foreign currency translation since the third quarter of fiscal  the company has presented its financial statements in us dollars 
however  the company has historically measured the parent company s financial statements in canadian dollars and its subsidiaries financial statements in their respective local currencies 
effective march   the beginning of fiscal  as a result of the company s increased economic activities denominated in us dollars  the us dollar has become the functional currency across the company s operations 
prior to march   the financial statements of the foreign subsidiaries were measured using the local currency as the functional currency 
all balance sheet amounts were translated using the exchange rates in effect at the applicable period end  and income statement amounts were translated using the weighted average exchange rates for the applicable period 
any gains and losses resulting from the changes in exchange rates from year to year were reported as a separate component of other comprehensive loss included in shareholders equity 
effective march   the carrying value of monetary balances denominated in currencies other than us dollars were remeasured at the balance sheet date rates of exchange 
the gains or losses resulting from the remeasurement of these amounts have been reflected in earnings in the respective periods 
non monetary items and any related amortization of such items are measured at the rates of exchange in effect when the assets were acquired or obligations incurred 
all other income and expense items have been remeasured at the average rates prevailing during the period 
forward looking statements certain statements in this management s discussion and analysis constitute forward looking statements 
such forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual results  performance or achievements of zarlink  or industry results  to be materially different from any future results  performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
such risks  uncertainties and assumptions include the following general economic and business conditions  increasing price and product service competition by foreign and domestic competitors  including new entrants  demographic changes  import protection and regulation  rapid technological developments and changes  the ability to continue to introduce competitive new products on a timely  cost effective basis  delays in product development  changes in environmental and other domestic and foreign governmental regulations  product mix  protection and validity of patent and other intellectual property rights  industry competition  industry capacity and other industry trends  the ability of zarlink to attract and retain key employees and other factors referenced elsewhere in this form k 
the above factors are representative of the risks  uncertainties and assumptions that could affect the outcome of the forward looking statements 
in addition  such statements could be affected by general industry and market conditions and growth rates  general domestic and international economic conditions including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations and other risks  uncertainties and assumptions  as described elsewhere in this form k  including those identified under forward looking statements and risk factors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the financial statements of the company due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates 
zarlink is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange and interest rates 
to manage these risks  the company uses certain derivative financial instruments including foreign exchange forward contracts and other derivative instruments from time to time  which have been authorized pursuant to board approved policies and procedures 
zarlink does not hold or issue financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the company uses forward contracts  and to a lesser extent foreign currency options  to reduce the exposure to foreign exchange risk 
the most significant foreign exchange exposures for the company  after the change to the us dollar as the functional currency in fiscal  relate to the canadian dollar  the swedish krona and the uk pound sterling 
at march   there were unrealized losses of on the forward contracts and foreign currency options relating to fiscal the unrealized loss is calculated as the difference between the actual contract rates and the applicable current market rates that would be used to terminate the forward contracts and foreign currency options on march   if it became necessary to unwind these contracts 
additional potential gains in the net fair value of these contracts  assuming a appreciation in the us dollar against all currencies  at march   would have been approximately conversely  a depreciation in the dollar against all currencies would have produced a loss of management believes that the established hedges are effective against its known and anticipated cash flows  and that potential future losses from these hedges being marked to market would be largely offset by gains on the underlying hedged transactions 
for fiscal  the company s primary exposure to interest rates is expected to be in the rollover of its short term investment portfolio 
in accordance with company policy  cash equivalent and short term investment balances are primarily comprised of high grade money market instruments with original maturity dates of less than one year 
the company does not hedge the re investment risk on its short term investments 
based on a sensitivity analysis performed on the financial instruments held at march  that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  the impact to the fair value of our cash equivalents and short term investments portfolio by an immediate hypothetical parallel shift in the yield curve of plus or minus  or basis points would result in an insignificant decline or increase in portfolio value 
the estimated potential losses discussed previously assume the occurrence of certain adverse market conditions 
they do not consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors and do not represent projected losses in fair value that the company expects to incur 
any future financial impact would be based on actual developments in global financial markets 
management does not foresee any significant changes in the strategies used to manage foreign exchange and interest rate risks in the near future
