item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations analyzes the consolidated financial condition  changes in financial position  and results of operations for the three years ended december   of triad guaranty inc and its consolidated subsidiaries  collectively the company 
the discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes 
certain of the statements contained herein  other than statements of historical fact  are forward looking statements 
these statements are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of and include estimates and assumptions related to economic  competitive  and legislative developments 
these forward looking statements are subject to change and uncertainty  which are  in many instances  beyond our control and have been made based upon our expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and their potential effect on us 
there can be no assurance that future developments will be in accordance with our expectations or that the effect of future developments on the company will be those anticipated by us 
actual results could differ materially from those expected by us  depending on the outcome of certain factors  including the possibility of general economic and business conditions that are different than anticipated  legislative developments  changes in interest rates or the stock markets  stronger than anticipated competitive activity  and the factors described in the forward looking statements 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements  in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the ultimate outcome could differ from those estimates and assumptions utilized in the preparation of the financial statements 
we have identified the following estimates as critical in that they involve a higher degree of judgment and are subject to a significant degree of variability reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses  the timely identification of potentially impaired securities and valuation of those securities  and deferred policy acquisition costs 
in developing these estimates  we make subjective and complex judgments that are inherently uncertain and subject to material change as facts and circumstances develop 
although variability is inherent in these estimates  we believe the amounts provided are appropriate based on the facts available upon compilation of the financial statements 
reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses we establish reserves using estimated claim rates frequency and estimated claim amounts severity to project ultimate losses 
our reserving process incorporates numerous factors in a formula that give effect to current economic conditions and profiles delinquencies by such primary factors as policy year  geography  chronic late payment characteristics  and the number of months the policy has been in default 
because the estimate for loss reserves is sensitive to the estimates of claims frequency and severity  we perform sensitivity analyses to test the reasonableness of the best estimate generated by the loss reserve process 
the loss reserve estimation process and the sensitivity analyses support the reasonableness of the best estimate of loss reserves recorded as a liability in the financial statements 
our reserving process is based upon the assumption that past experience  taking into consideration the above factors  adjusted for anticipated economic conditions and projected future economic trends  provides a reasonable basis for estimating severity and frequency 
we consider severity and frequency to be the most significant assumptions in the establishment of our loss reserves 
inherently  there are risks and uncertainties involved in making these assumptions 
investments valuing our investment portfolio involves a variety of assumptions and estimates  particularly for investments that are not actively traded 
we rely on external pricing sources for highly liquid publicly traded securities and use an internal pricing matrix for privately placed securities 
this matrix relies on our judgment concerning a the discount rate we use in calculating expected future cash flows  b credit quality  and c expected maturity 
we regularly monitor our investment portfolio to ensure that investments that may be other than temporarily impaired are identified in a timely fashion  properly valued  and any other than temporary impairments are charged against earnings in the proper period 
our methodology to identify potential impairments requires judgment and is further described in the investments section of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the timely identification and valuation of potentially impaired securities involves many judgments 
inherently  there are risks and uncertainties involved in making these judgments 
changes in circumstances and critical assumptions such as unforeseen events which affect our investments in one or more companies  political subdivisions  or industries could result in additional write downs in future periods for impairments that are deemed to be other than temporary 
deferred policy acquisition costs the costs of acquiring new business  principally commissions and certain policy underwriting and issue costs which vary with and are primarily related to the production of new business  are capitalized as deferred policy acquisition costs dac 
amortization of such policy acquisition costs is charged to expense in proportion to premium recognized over the estimated policy life 
we make judgments in the identification of deferrable acquisition costs and the determination of estimated policy life utilized in the amortization assumptions 
see further discussion of deferred policy acquisition costs under the financial position section of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview through our subsidiaries  we provide mortgage guaranty insurance coverage to residential mortgage lenders and investors as a credit enhancement vehicle  typically when individual borrowers have less than equity in the property 
business originated by lenders and submitted to us on an individual basis is referred to as flow business 
mortgage guaranty insurance facilitates the sale of individual low down payment loans in the secondary market and provides protection to lenders who choose to keep the loans 
additionally  we provide mortgage insurance to lenders and investors who seek additional default protection  capital relief  and credit enhancement on groups of loans that are sold in the secondary market 
this business is referred to as structured bulk business 
we derive our revenues principally from a initial and renewal earned premiums from flow business net of reinsurance premiums ceded as part of our risk management strategies  b initial and renewal earned premiums from structured bulk transactions  and c investment income on invested assets 
we also realize investment gains periodically as a source of revenue when the opportunity presents itself within the confines of our overall investment strategy 
our expenses essentially consist of a amounts paid on claims submitted  b increases in reserves for estimated future claim payments  c costs of acquiring new business and servicing existing policies  and d other general business expenses including income taxes 
our profitability depends largely on a the adequacy of our product pricing and underwriting discipline relative to the risks insured  b persistency levels  c operating efficiencies  and d the level of investment yield  including realized gains and losses  on our investment portfolio 
consolidated results of operations following is a summary of our results for the last three years dollars in thousands except per share information earned premiums net investment income net realized investment gains losses other income total revenues net losses and loss adjustment expenses interest expense on debt amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs other operating expenses net of acquisition costs deferred income before income taxes income taxes net income diluted earnings per share a primary driver of our results is persistency 
we define persistency as the percentage of insurance in force remaining from twelve months prior 
in  we achieved record levels of production due primarily to the increased level of refinance activity and our increased penetration in the bulk marketplace 
however  low persistency levels  also reflective of the higher refinance activity  had a negative impact on our results 
lower persistency adversely affected us in two ways a renewal earned premium decreased as the mortgages generating the renewal premium refinanced and b expenses increased through higher amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs 
we saw persistency drop through most of  reaching its low point in the third quarter 
mortgage interest rates crept up in the latter part of the year  resulting in moderately improved persistency in the fourth quarter 
two other important drivers of our results have been the increase in bulk production and our continued commitment to risk sharing arrangements with our lender partners 
we address these primary drivers and the impact each had in the detailed year by year comparisons that follow this discussion 
the information is presented in three categories production and in force  revenues  and losses and expenses 
compared to net income for increased to million from million in net income per share on a diluted basis increased to for from per share for this improvement in net income was driven by a increase in earned premiums and a increase in net investment income 
net income for includes net realized investment gains  net of income taxes  of million  while net income for included net after tax realized investment losses of million 
production and in force total insurance written in was billion compared to billion in  an increase of 
total insurance written includes insurance written from flow production and structured bulk transactions 
flow insurance written for increased to billion from billion in this increase was primarily the result of expanding relationships with national lenders  strong demand for risk sharing arrangements and other product offerings  and a lower interest rate environment that contributed to a very strong refinance market 
insurance written in attributable to structured bulk transactions totaled billion compared to billion in the jump in structured bulk transactions written was driven by a robust growth in the overall bulk marketplace in coupled with our renewed strategic commitment to that market 
our investments in technology and personnel enabled us to participate successfully in this arena in structured bulk transactions are generally initiated by secondary mortgage market participants who wish to use mortgage insurance as a credit enhancement 
we compete against other mortgage insurers as well as other forms of credit enhancement provided by capital markets for these transactions 
insurance written attributed to structured bulk transactions is likely to vary significantly from period to period  as opposed to insurance written from flow originations  due to a the limited number of transactions but with larger size occurring in this market  b competition from other mortgage insurers  c the attractiveness in the marketplace of mortgage insurance versus other forms of credit enhancement  and d the changing loan composition and underwriting criteria of the market 
although terms vary  the bulk market can be broadly categorized into three different segments  or tiers  depending on the risk characteristics of the loans comprising a transaction 
the loan characteristics of the three segments are a predominantly high credit quality  low loan to value ltv  fully underwritten loans that may have niche characteristics such as non conforming loan balances and risk concentrations related to geography  transaction purpose  or occupancy type  b loans that generally have high credit quality and low to moderate ltvs that have been underwritten with reduced  streamlined  or no documentation  and c generally fully underwritten loans with credit impaired borrowers fico credit score less than 
in general  we believe that bulk business originated in segments b and c will report a higher default rate than our flow business 
however  we also believe that the lower ltvs associated with bulk business ultimately will generate proportionately lower claim rates as a proportion of the reported defaults and lower levels of severity than flow business 
we have entered into bulk transactions primarily in the first two segments mentioned above 
at december   only approximately of our insurance in force attributable to structured bulk transactions is categorized in segment c above 
according to industry data  our national market share of net new primary insurance written  which includes insurance written on a flow basis as well as that attributed to structured bulk transactions  was for for the fourth quarter compared to for for the fourth quarter 
our national market share of net new primary insurance written on a flow basis was for for the fourth quarter compared to for in the fourth quarter 
industry data indicates that we had of the national market share attributable to structured bulk transactions in compared to in periodically we enter into structured bulk transactions involving loans that have insurance effective dates within the current reporting period but for which detailed loan information regarding the insured loans is not provided by the issuer of the transaction until later 
when this situation occurs  we accrue premiums that are due but not yet paid based upon the estimated commitment amount of the transaction in the reporting period with respect to each loan s insurance effective date 
however  the policies are not reflected in our in force  insurance written  or related industry data totals until the loan level detail is reported to us 
at december   we had approximately billion of structured transactions with effective dates within the fourth quarter for which loan level detail had not been received and  therefore  are not included in our own data or industry totals 
these amounts will be reported as new production and insurance in force totals in when the issuer of the transactions provides loan level detail to us 
we have properly included in premium written and premium earned the respective amounts due and earned during the fourth quarter of related to this insurance 
total direct insurance in force reached billion at december   compared to billion at december  significant refinance activity in and resulted in a high level of policy cancellations that substantially offset the impact that the high level of insurance written had on in force growth 
as a result  insurance in force increased by only billion in  even though insurance written during was billion 
refinance activity was of insurance written in the fourth quarter in compared to in the fourth quarter in persistency was at december   compared to at december  the high level of refinance activity and the resulting decrease in persistency is reflective of the low interest rate environment that has been in place during the past year 
the annualized quarterly persistency rate for the fourth quarter of was compared to for the third quarter of and for the fourth quarter of changes in interest rates generally take a few months to affect persistency 
during the third and fourth quarters of  interest rates moderately increased from the record low levels seen in june and july 
if these interest rate levels persist or if interest rates increase further  we believe that persistency should improve in however  if rates decline significantly from current levels  persistency could return to levels comparable to the first nine months of we define persistency as the percentage of insurance in force remaining from twelve months prior 
cancellations of policies originated during the past twelve months are not considered in our calculation of persistency 
this method of calculating persistency may vary from that of other mortgage insurers 
we believe that our calculation presents an accurate measure of the percentage of insurance in force remaining from twelve months prior 
cancellations result primarily from the borrower refinancing or selling mortgaged residential properties and  to a lesser degree  from the borrower achieving prescribed equity levels at which the lender no longer requires mortgage guaranty insurance 
the primary driver of our reduced persistency over the past two years has been the record low interest rates on mortgage loans 
fico credit scores are one of the factors used in determining credit risk 
the following table presents the fico credit score distribution of our insurance in force at december  and percent of insurance in force december credit score less than credit score between and credit score greater than as the table shows  we insure some loans that have fico credit scores below we believe that these loans have a higher probability of loss than a loan with a fico credit score of or greater 
we do not expect loans with fico scores less than to become a significant portion of our insurance in force 
revenues total direct premiums written were million for  an increase of compared to million for net premiums written increased by to million in from million for contributing to the increase in premiums written for were significant writings under our annual premium payment plan 
the annual premium payment plan requires a first year premium paid at mortgage loan closing  with the entire amount reported as premium written 
the annual premium payment plan contrasts with our monthly premium payment plan which involves  in general  the payment of one or two months premium at mortgage loan closing and monthly renewal payments thereafter  with the associated amounts reported as premium written 
during  of total insurance written was under the annual premium payment plan compared to of total insurance written during the difference between direct premiums written and net premiums written is ceded premium 
ceded premium is comprised of premiums paid on both excess of loss reinsurance treaties as well as risk sharing arrangements with our lender partners referred to as captive reinsurance arrangements 
driven by an increase in the amount of premium subject to captive reinsurance arrangements  ceded premiums written increased to million in from million in our premium cede rate the ratio of ceded premiums written to direct premiums written was for compared to for our premium cede rate for captive reinsurance arrangements the ratio of ceded premiums written under captive reinsurance arrangements to total direct premiums written was for compared to for the average premium cede rate for direct premiums written subject to captive reinsurance arrangements was in compared to in during  approximately billion of insurance written  or of flow insurance written of total insurance written including structured bulk transactions was subject to captive reinsurance arrangements compared to billion of insurance written  or of flow insurance written including structured bulk transactions  in the same period of the decline in the percentage of flow insurance written subject to captive reinsurance arrangements from to is primarily a result of increased production in our lender paid mortgage insurance program that is not subject to captive reinsurance arrangements 
through december   insurance written attributable to structured bulk transactions was not subject to captive reinsurance arrangements 
approximately of direct flow insurance in force of total insurance in force was subject to captive reinsurance arrangements at december   compared to of total insurance in force at december  this increase was due primarily to the increased market penetration of our captive reinsurance arrangements and the high level of refinance activity in  as policies that were previously not subject to captive reinsurance arrangements refinanced and new policies issued were subject to captive reinsurance arrangements 
we anticipate that ceded premiums will continue to increase as a result of the expected increase in insurance in force subject to captive reinsurance arrangements 
we continue to see the success of our strategic initiatives to provide captive risk sharing alternatives to selected lender partners 
we remain committed to the concept of captive reinsurance arrangements on a lender by lender basis 
captive reinsurance arrangements have evolved during the past year and will continue to evolve in we will continue to be an active participant with our lender partners in structures utilizing alternative attachment points  risk bands  cede rates  and ceding commissions 
one of our competitors announced that  effective april   it would not participate in captive arrangements where the net premium cede rate is greater than deep ceded 
according to recent articles  two other competitors have recently announced that they will limit the amount of premium they will cede under deep ceded captive arrangements 
where prudent  we plan to continue to participate in captive risk sharing arrangements  including deep ceded arrangements  on a lender by lender basis 
it is uncertain at this time what impact  if any  the competitors decisions  as described above  will have on our production of insurance subject to captive reinsurance arrangements 
earned premiums increased to million for from million for the difference between net written premiums and earned premiums in is due to the significant writings of our annual premium product and the related increase in the unearned premium reserve 
our unearned premium liability increased to million at december   from million at december  direct written premium from the annual premium product represented of direct premium written in compared to of direct premium written in the growth in written and earned premiums resulted from strong levels of new insurance written offset by the impact of a low level of persistency and by the increase in ceded premiums 
net investment income for was million  a increase over million in average invested assets grew by million to million for the year ended december   an increase of from million for the increase in average invested assets is attributable to funds derived from normal operating cash flow in the percentage increase in net investment income was much lower than the percentage increase in invested assets primarily due to a decrease in investment yields 
we reported million of net realized investment gains during and million of net realized investment losses during net realized gains during included approximately  of impairment writedowns 
the writedowns primarily involved securities in the automotive  energy  and pharmaceutical sectors as well as a commercial mortgage backed security 
losses and expenses 
net incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses net of reinsurance recoveries increased by in to million from million in the increase in losses and loss adjustment expenses was anticipated based upon the growth in the number of delinquencies and is reflective of our overall growth of insurance in force  relative growth of our participation in the bulk market  and the seasoning of our in force business 
net paid losses  excluding loss adjustment expenses  increased to million during from million during  an increase of 
the increase in net paid losses approximates the increase in incurred losses and was within our expected range 
average severity direct paid losses divided by number of claims paid was approximately  for compared to  for the following table provides detail on direct paid losses from flow business and structured bulk business in thousands of dollars 
direct losses paid flow business bulk business total our loss ratio the ratio of incurred losses to earned premiums was for compared to for the loss ratio was for the fourth quarter of and for the fourth quarter of as mentioned earlier  the increase in the loss ratio is consistent with our expectations given the overall growth of insurance in force  relative growth of our participation in the bulk market  and the seasoning of our in force business 
as of december   approximately of our insurance in force was originated in the last months compared to at december  we believe  based upon our experience and industry data  that claims incidence for flow business is generally highest in the third through sixth years after loan origination 
we believe that the period of highest claims incidence for structured bulk transactions is earlier than that for flow business 
we expect our incurred losses to increase as a greater amount of our insurance in force reaches its anticipated highest claim frequency years 
changes in the economic environment could accelerate paid and incurred loss development 
due to the inherent uncertainty of future premium levels  losses  economic conditions  and other factors that affect earnings  it is difficult to predict with any degree of certainty the impact of such higher claim frequencies on future earnings 
amortization of dac increased by to million in from million for the increase reflects growth in dac related to the expansion of our insurance in force and accelerated amortization due to higher cancellations from refinance activity in our model calculates the amortization of dac separately for each book year 
the model accelerates dac amortization through a dynamic adjustment when persistency for a book year is lower than the estimated persistency originally utilized in the model 
the dynamic adjustment effectively adjusts the estimated policy life originally utilized in the model to a revised policy life based upon the current actual persistency 
low persistency levels during the past two years resulted in additional amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs through dynamic adjustments totaling million in and million in if persistency improves in compared to  we would expect additional amortization of dac resulting from the dynamic adjustment to be lower  depending on the level of improvement 
however  if persistency does not improve  we would expect similar levels of additional amortization through dynamic adjustments to that which occurred in other operating expenses decreased to million for from million for the decline in other operating expenses is primarily the result of operational efficiencies achieved through the use of technology 
we have made substantial investments in technology that allow for significant increases in volume without a proportional increase in operating expenses 
as a result  the substantial majority of our business now enters into our administrative systems through electronic interfaces at a lower cost than those requiring manual intervention 
the expense ratio ratio of the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and other operating expenses to net premiums written for was compared to for the expense ratio for improved because other operating expenses decreased and net written premium increased  offset somewhat by the accelerated amortization of dac 
our effective tax rate was for and for the decrease in the effective tax rate is due primarily to an increase in tax exempt interest resulting from a higher percentage of assets being invested in tax preferred securities 
we expect our effective tax rate to remain near current levels or increase slightly as we expect earned premium to grow faster than tax preferred income 
compared to net income for increased to million from million in net income per share on a diluted basis increased to for from per share for this improvement in net income was led by a increase in earned premiums and a increase in net investment income 
net income for included after tax net realized investment losses of million  while net income for included after tax net realized investment gains of  also included in net income for was the receipt of a nonrecurring incentive payment of approximately million  relating to the voluntary cancellation of one of our excess of loss corporate reinsurance contracts 
production and in force total insurance written in was billion compared to billion in  an increase of 
flow insurance written for increased to billion from billion in the increase in insurance written from flow production was primarily the result of expanding relationships with national lenders  strong demand for risk sharing arrangements  and an expanding marketplace as the result of lower interest rates 
insurance written in attributable to structured bulk transactions totaled billion compared to billion in according to industry data  triad s national market share of net new primary insurance written was for compared to for triad s national market share of net new primary insurance written on a flow basis was for compared to for total direct insurance in force reached billion at december   compared to billion at december   an increase of 
increased refinance activity in drove a high level of policy cancellations that partially offset the impact that the high level of insurance written had on in force growth 
refinance activity was of insurance written in compared to in excluding structured bulk transactions  refinance activity was of insurance written in compared to of insurance written in persistency was at december   compared to at december  the increased level of refinance activity and the resulting decrease in persistency was reflective of the low interest rate environment that was in place during revenues total direct premiums written were million for  an increase of compared to million for net premiums written increased by to million in from million for driven primarily by increases in captive arrangements and also by excess of loss reinsurance  ceded premiums written increased to million in from million in our premium cede rate was for compared to for our premium cede rate for captive reinsurance was for compared to for approximately of flow insurance written of total insurance written including structured bulk transactions during was subject to captive mortgage reinsurance compared to of flow insurance written of total insurance written including structured bulk transactions in approximately of direct insurance in force was subject to captive arrangements at december   compared to at december  the increase in insurance in force subject to captive arrangements was due primarily to the increased market penetration of our captive arrangements and the increased level of refinance activity during earned premiums increased to million for from million for the growth in written and earned premium resulted from record levels of insurance written offset by the impact of a declining persistency rate due to a high level of refinance activity 
net investment income for was million  a increase over million in this increase was the result of growth in the average balance of invested assets by million to million for the year ended december   from million for the growth in invested assets was attributable to normal operating cash flow 
the percentage increase in net investment income was lower than the percentage increase in invested assets primarily due to a decrease in investment yields that were a result of the low interest rates in for new investments and the disposal of a number of higher yielding corporate bonds with lower credit quality during to enhance the overall quality of the portfolio 
we reported million of net realized investment losses during  which included approximately million of impairment writedowns 
the writedowns primarily involved securities in the telecommunications and technology sectors and  to a lesser degree  the airline  energy  electronic manufacturing  and textile manufacturing industries 
losses and expenses 
net losses and loss adjustment expenses net of reinsurance recoveries increased by in to million from million in the rise reflected an increase in paid losses and delinquent loans as our insurance in force grew and the condition of the economy remained weak 
net paid losses and loss adjustment expenses increased to million during from million during reported delinquent loans totaled  at december   compared to  at december   an increase of 
our loss ratio was for compared to for amortization of dac increased by to million in from million for the increase in amortization reflected growth in dac related to the growth of our insurance in force and accelerated amortization due to higher cancellations from refinance activity in decreased persistency levels during and resulted in additional dac amortization through dynamic adjustments totaling million in and million in other operating expenses increased to million for from million for this increase in expenses was primarily attributable to personnel  technology amortization  and equipment and software costs required to support our increased levels of production  product development  system enhancements  and geographic expansion 
the expense ratio for was compared to for our effective tax rate was for both and significant customers our objective is to continually grow market share through controlled  profitable growth in both the flow and bulk arenas while adhering to our risk management strategies 
our strategy is to continue our focus on national lenders while maintaining the productive relationships that we have built with regional lenders 
however  consolidation within the mortgage origination industry has resulted in a greater percentage of production volume being concentrated among a smaller customer base 
our ten largest customers were responsible for   and of flow insurance written during   and  respectively 
our two largest customers were responsible for   and of flow insurance written during   and  respectively 
measured by risk in force  our ten largest customers were responsible for   and of flow risk in force at december    and  respectively 
additionally  our two largest customers were responsible for   and of flow risk in force at december    and  respectively 
the loss of one or more of these significant customers could have an adverse effect on our business 
financial position total assets increased to million at december   a growth over the same date in total liabilities increased to million at december   from million in this section identifies several items on our balance sheet that are important in the overall understanding of our financial position 
these items include deferred policy acquisition costs  prepaid federal income tax and related deferred income taxes  and loss and loss adjustment expense reserves 
our mortgage insurance operations and reserves are primarily supported by our investment portfolio 
the majority of our assets are contained in the investment portfolio 
a separate investments section follows the financial position section and reviews our investment portfolio  key portfolio management strategies  and methodologies in which we manage credit risk 
deferred policy acquisition costs costs expended to acquire new business are capitalized as deferred policy acquisition costs dac and recognized as expense over the anticipated premium paying life of the policy 
we employ dynamic models that calculate amortization of dac separately for each book year 
the models rely on assumptions that we make based upon historical industry experience and our own unique experience regarding the annual persistency development of each book year 
persistency is the most important assumption utilized in determining the timing of reported amortization expense reflected in the income statement and the carrying value of dac on the balance sheet 
a change in the assumed persistency can impact the current and future amortization expense as well as the carrying value on the balance sheet 
however  our models are dynamic and adjust when actual book year persistency is lower than the assumptions employed in the models 
when this happens  the dac amortization is accelerated through a dynamic adjustment in order to match the amortization expense with the life of the policies on which the acquisition costs were originally deferred 
the following table shows the dac asset for the previous three years and the effect of persistency on amortization amounts in thousands dac asset balance beginning of year costs capitalized amortization normal amortization dynamic adjustment total amortization balance end of year annual persistency prepaid federal income taxes and deferred income taxes we purchase ten year non interest bearing united states mortgage guaranty tax and loss bonds tax and loss bonds in lieu of paying current federal income taxes to take advantage of a special contingency reserve deduction for mortgage guaranty companies 
the cumulative sum of the tax and loss bonds purchased  net of those matured  is classified on our balance sheet as prepaid federal income taxes 
these purchases of tax and loss bonds are essentially a prepayment of federal income taxes that will become due in ten years when the tax and loss bonds mature 
at december   prepaid income taxes amounted to million  compared to million at december  the change from year to year approximates the change in deferred income tax liability for the year 
deferred income taxes are provided for the differences in reporting taxable income in the financial statements and on the tax return 
these cumulative differences are enumerated in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the largest cumulative difference is the special contingency reserve deduction for mortgage insurers mentioned above 
the remainder of the deferred tax liability has primarily arisen from book and tax reporting differences related to deferred policy acquisition costs and unrealized investment gains 
loss and loss adjustment expense reserve we establish reserves using estimated claim rates frequency and claim amounts severity to estimate ultimate losses 
our reserving process incorporates numerous factors in a formula that gives effect to current economic conditions and profiles delinquencies by such factors as policy year  geography  chronic late payment characteristics  and the number of months the policy has been in default 
because the estimate for loss reserves is sensitive to the estimates of claims frequency and severity  we perform sensitivity analyses to test the reasonableness of the best estimate generated by the loss reserve process 
we periodically review the loss reserve process in order to improve its estimate of ultimate losses on loans currently in default 
adjustments to reserve estimates are reflected in the financial statements in the periods in which the adjustments are made 
our loss and loss adjustment expense reserves increased to million at december   compared to million at december  note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contains a roll forward of these amounts for the last two years showing the incurred losses and the actual payments for the current and prior years 
loss and loss adjustment expense reserves are established when notices of default on insured mortgage loans are received 
reserves also are established for estimated losses incurred on notices of default not yet reported by the lender 
consistent with industry practices  we do not establish loss reserves for future claims on insured loans that are not currently in default 
the growth in loss reserves is primarily the result of the increase in reported defaults 
over of our insurance in force was written within the last two years 
experience indicates that years three through six have the highest incidence of defaults 
because of this fact  we expect loss reserves to continue to grow  reflecting the growth and aging of our insurance in force 
the following table shows default statistics as of december   and default statistics number of insured loans in force number of loans in default percentage of loans in default default rate number of insured loans in force excluding bulk loans number of loans in default excluding bulk loans percentage of loans in default excluding bulk loans number of bulk loans in force number of bulk loans in default percentage of bulk loans in default the number of loans in default excludes those loans days past due or less 
the increase in the default rate for bulk business is attributable primarily to the maturing of the bulk portfolio and the higher expected default rate 
contributing to changes in default rates is changes in the number of policies in force  which is the denominator in the default rate calculation 
all else being equal  an increase decrease in the policies in force results in a lower higher default rate 
as a result  production levels as well as persistency have an effect on the reported default rates 
the default occurrences for both flow business and structured bulk business are consistent with management s expectation 
investment portfolio portfolio description our strategy for managing our investment portfolio is to meet or exceed regulatory and rating agency requirements while appropriately managing credit risk 
we invest for the long term  and most of our investments are held until they mature 
our investment portfolio includes primarily fixed income securities  and the majority of these are tax sheltered state and municipal bonds 
we have established a formal investment policy that describes our overall quality and diversification objectives and limits 
our investment policies and strategies are subject to change depending upon regulatory  economic  and market conditions and the existing or anticipated financial condition and operating requirements  including the tax position  of our company 
during  we strengthened our investment portfolio by increasing the overall credit quality 
at the end of  of the portfolio was rated a or higher as compared to at the end of additionally  we focused our new purchases on state and municipal tax preferred securities in our investment portfolio consists entirely of available for sale securities  therefore  all values are carried on our balance sheet at fair value

we attempt to maintain a level of liquidity and duration in our investment portfolio consistent with our business outlook and the expected timing  direction  and degree of changes in interest rates 
see note in notes to consolidated financial statements that describes the scheduled maturity of our fixed maturity investments 
another way that we manage risk and liquidity is to limit our exposure on individual securities 
as of december   no investment in the securities of any single issuer exceeded of our investment portfolio 
the growth in net investment income has moderated recently in spite of an increase in our overall investment portfolio 
the drop in the effective pre tax yield reflects the decrease in new money rates available for investment coupled with our strategies to increase the overall credit quality of the portfolio and increase our investment in state and municipal bonds 
the portfolio s yield was also affected by a higher percentage of the fixed income portfolio invested in short term investments at low yielding money market rates

we manage this risk through a structured approach in which we assess the effects of the changing economic landscape 
in identifying potentially distressed securities  we first screen for all securities that have a fair value to cost or amortized cost ratio of less than 
additionally  as part of this identification process  we utilize the following information for inclusion on the potentially distressed securities list length of time the fair value was below amortized cost industry factors or conditions related to a geographic area negatively affecting the security downgrades by a rating agency past due interest or principal payments or other violation of covenants deterioration of the overall financial condition of the specific issuer in analyzing our potentially distressed securities list for other than temporary impairments  we pay special attention to securities that have been on the list for a period greater than six months 
our ability and intent to retain the investment for a sufficient time to recover its value is also considered 
we assume that  absent reliable contradictory evidence  a security that is potentially distressed for a continuous period greater than nine months has incurred an other than temporary impairment 
such reliable contradictory evidence might include  among other factors  a liquidation analysis performed by our investment advisers or outside consultants  improving financial performance of the issuer  or valuation of underlying assets specifically pledged to support the credit 
when we conclude that the decline is other than temporary based on management s judgment  the security is written down to fair value through a charge to realized investment gains and losses 
we adjust the amortized cost for securities that have experienced other than temporary impairments to reflect fair value at the time of the impairment 
we consider factors that lead to an other than temporary impairment of a particular security in order to determine whether these conditions have impacted other similar securities 
unrealized losses at december   we had unrealized investment gains of million and unrealized investment losses of  these unrealized gains and losses do not necessarily represent future gains or losses that we will realize 
changing conditions related to specific securities  overall market interest rates  or credit spreads  as well as our decisions concerning the timing of a sale  may impact values we ultimately realize 
we monitor unrealized losses through further analysis according to maturity date  credit quality  individual creditor exposure and the length of time the individual security has continuously been in an unrealized loss position 
unrealized losses related to fixed maturities amounted to  at december   with the preponderance of the unrealized losses related to bonds with a maturity date in excess of ten years 
the largest individual unrealized loss on any one security at december   was  on a million par bond 
of the  gross unrealized losses at december   none was included in our potentially distressed securities list mentioned above 
information about unrealized gains and losses is subject to changing conditions 
securities with unrealized gains and losses will fluctuate  as will those securities that we have identified as potentially distressed 
the recent volatility of financial markets has led to an increase in both unrealized gains and losses 
we consider all of the factors discussed earlier when we determine if an unrealized loss is other than temporary  including our ability and intent to hold the security until the value recovers 
our current evaluation of other than temporary impairments reflects our positive intent to hold certain securities until maturity 
however  we may subsequently decide to sell certain of these securities in future periods within the overall context of our portfolio management strategies 
if we make the decision to dispose of a security with an unrealized loss  we will write down the security to its fair value if we have not sold it by the end of the reporting period 
liquidity and capital resources our sources of operating funds consist primarily of premiums written and investment income 
operating cash flow is applied primarily to the payment of claims  interest  expenses  and prepaid federal income taxes in the form of tax and loss bonds 
we generated positive cash flow from operating activities of million in compared to million for and million for the increase in cash flow from operating activities in reflects the growth in premiums and investment income and a decrease in other operating expenses paid offset partially by an increase in losses paid 
our business does not routinely require significant capital expenditures other than for enhancements to our computer systems and technological capabilities 
positive cash flows are invested pending future payments of claims and expenses 
cash flow shortfalls  if any  could be funded through sales of short term investments and other investment portfolio securities 
the insurance laws of the state of illinois impose certain restrictions on dividends that an insurance subsidiary can pay the parent company 
these restrictions  based on statutory accounting practices  include requirements that dividends may be paid only out of statutory earned surplus and that limit the amount of dividends that may be paid without prior approval of the illinois insurance department 
there have been no dividends paid by the insurance subsidiaries to the parent company 
we cede business to captive reinsurance subsidiaries of certain mortgage lenders captives  primarily under excess of loss reinsurance agreements 
generally  reinsurance recoverables on loss reserves and unearned premiums ceded to these captives are backed by trust funds or letters of credit 
total stockholders equity increased to million at december   from million at december  this increase resulted primarily from net income of million  an increase in net unrealized gains on invested assets classified as available for sale of million net of income tax  and additional paid in capital of million resulting from the exercise of employee stock options and the related tax benefit 
total statutory policyholders surplus for our insurance subsidiaries increased to million at december   from million at december  the primary difference between statutory policyholders surplus and equity computed under generally accepted accounting principles is the statutory contingency reserve 
the balance in the statutory contingency reserve was million at december   compared to million at december  statutory capital  for the purpose of computing the total risk in force to statutory capital  includes both policyholders surplus and the contingency reserve 
statutory capital amounted to million at december   compared to million at december  triad s ability to write insurance depends on the maintenance of its financial strength ratings and the adequacy of its capital in relation to risk in force 
a significant reduction of capital or a significant increase in risk may impair triad s ability to write additional insurance 
a number of states also generally limit triad s risk to capital ratio to to as of december   triad s risk to capital ratio was to as compared to to at december   and to for the industry as a whole at december   the latest industry data available 
the risk to capital ratio is calculated using net risk in force  which takes into account risk ceded under reinsurance arrangements  including captive risk sharing arrangements as well as any applicable stop loss limits  as the numerator  and statutory capital as the denominator 
triad is rated aa by both standard poor s ratings services and fitch ratings and aa by moody s investors service 
in july of  s p revised its rating outlook for the us private mortgage insurance industry to negative from stable 
according to s p  industry outlooks are primarily determined by the expected course of rating actions during the next one to two years 
s p stated that they see little chance that there will be any outlook or rating improvements among the mortgage insurers in the next one to two years  but they do see a considerable possibility that there will be some negative revisions in outlooks and ratings 
in january  fitch revised its rating outlook for the us private mortgage insurance industry to negative from stable 
currently  fitch  s p  and moody s all report a stable ratings outlook for triad 
a reduction in triad s rating or outlook could adversely affect our operations 
fannie mae has recently completed the process of revising its approval requirements for mortgage insurers 
the new requirements require prior approval by fannie mae for many of triad s activities and new products  allow for other approved types of mortgage insurers rated less than aa  and give fannie mae increased rights to revise the eligibility standards of mortgage insurers 
while continuing to study the final requirements  we do not see any material impact on our current or future operations as a result of the new rules  although a material impact could still occur if our interpretation is incorrect 
the office of federal housing enterprise oversight ofheo issued its risk based capital rules for fannie mae and freddie mac in the first quarter of the regulation provides capital guidelines for fannie mae and freddie mac in connection with their use of various types of credit protection counterparties including a more preferential capital credit for insurance from a aaa rated private mortgage insurer than for insurance from a aa rated private mortgage insurer 
the phase in period for ofheo s risk based capital rules is ten years 
we do not believe the new risk based capital rules had an adverse impact on our financial condition for nor that these rules will have a significant adverse impact on our financial condition in the future 
however  if the risk based capital rules result in future changes to the preferences of fannie mae and freddie mac regarding their use of the various types of credit enhancements or their choice of mortgage insurers based on their credit rating  our financial condition could be significantly harmed 
off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations we lease office facilities  automobiles  and office equipment under operating leases with minimum lease commitments that range from one to ten years 
we have no capitalized leases or material purchase commitments 
our long term debt has a single maturity date of the following schedule represents our aggregate contractual obligations as of december  in thousands of dollars 
payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt operating leases total market risk exposure fixed maturity securities represented approximately of our invested assets at december  while the fair value of these fixed rate securities generally bears an inverse relationship to changes in prevailing market interest rates  a change in market interest rates would not immediately impact earnings because we generally hold these securities until maturity 
however  a decrease in market interest rates generally will have the effect of initiating an early call provision of those securities possessing such provisions 
the proceeds relating to the early called securities in a decreasing interest rate environment generally are invested in lower yielding investments that would ultimately decrease earnings 
our long term debt matures in with no early call or put provisions and bears interest at a fixed rate of per annum 
the fair value of this debt is sensitive to changes in prevailing interest rates  however  a change in rates would not impact earnings 
we believe that a increase or decrease in market interest rates is reasonable for the upcoming year 
a relative increase or decrease in market interest rates that affect our financial instruments would not have a material impact on earnings during the next fiscal year 
safe harbor statement under the private securities litigation reform act of management s discussion and analysis and this report contain forward looking statements relating to future plans  expectations  and performance which involve various risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to  the following interest rates may increase or decrease from their current levels  housing transactions requiring mortgage insurance may decrease for many reasons including changes in interest rates or economic conditions  our market share may change as a result of changes in underwriting criteria or competitive products or rates  the amount of insurance written could be adversely affected by changes in federal housing legislation  including changes in the federal housing administration loan limits and coverage requirements of freddie mac and fannie mae  our financial condition and competitive position could be affected by legislation or regulation impacting the mortgage guaranty industry or the government sponsored entities  specifically  and the financial services industry in general  rating agencies may revise methodologies for determining our financial strength ratings and may revise or withdraw the assigned ratings at any time  decreases in persistency  which are affected by loan refinancings in periods of low interest rates  may have an adverse effect on earnings  the amount of insurance written and the growth in insurance in force or risk in force as well as our performance may be adversely impacted by the competitive environment in the private mortgage insurance industry  including the type  structure  and pricing of our products and services and our competitors  if we fail to properly underwrite mortgage loans under contract underwriting service agreements  we may be required to assume the costs of repurchasing those loans  with consolidation occurring among mortgage lenders and our concentration of insurance in force generated through relationships with significant lender customers  our margins may be compressed and the loss of a significant customer may have an adverse effect on our earnings  our performance may be impacted by changes in the performance of the financial markets and general economic conditions  economic downturns in regions where our risk is more concentrated could have a particularly adverse effect on our financial condition and loss development  ofheo risk based capital rules could severely limit our ability to compete against various types of credit protection counterparties  including aaa rated private mortgage insurers  changes in the eligibility guidelines of fannie mae or freddie mac could have an adverse effect on the company  proposed regulation by the department of housing and urban development to exclude packages of real estate settlement services  which may include any required mortgage insurance premium paid at closing  from the anti referral provisions of the real estate settlement procedures act could adversely affect our earnings 
accordingly  actual results may differ from those set forth in the forward looking statements
