such statements are based on current expectations that involve inherent risks and uncertainties  including those discussed below and under the heading risks associated with our business and future operating results that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed 
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date hereof 
we undertake no obligation to update any forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 
overview business portal develops  markets  provisions  and supports customer management and billing cm b solutions for telecommunications and information service providers 
our convergent platform enables service providers to deliver voice  data  video and content services with multiple networks  payment models  pricing plans and value chains 
portal believes that the growth and rapid change in the telecommunications and information service provider market provide a unique opportunity for portal s solutions which provide real time  flexible and scalable solutions for these markets 
to fully realize this opportunity  portal must expand its penetration in this market enabling us to grow our revenues and to achieve profitability and positive cash flow 
while portal currently provides solutions for some of the leading global telecommunications and information service providers  we face competitors with substantially more financial resources than portal 
as such  we must demonstrate to our customers our ability to successfully compete with larger solution providers and that we are able to provide an equal or greater ability to support our products today and in the future and our ability to continue to enhance our products to support this rapidly changing market into the future 
financial beginning with fiscal  substantially all of our revenues have come from the license of one product line  infranet  and from related services 
revenues consist of infranet licenses  professional services and maintenance fees 
license revenues are comprised of perpetual or multi year license fees  which are primarily derived from contracts with telecommunications and information service providers 
professional services consist of a broad range of implementation services  training  business consulting and operational support services 
these services are provided throughout the customer lifecycle 
we believe that future revenues will be generated primarily from the following sources services for the deployment of licenses and follow on solutions related to our customers end to end billing needs  license fees from new customers  for new products or new infranet modules to existing customers  and growth in the subscriber base of existing customers  which will lead to increased revenue from subscriber based licenses  and annual maintenance fees for the support of existing deployments and rights to access when and if available upgrade enhancements to our platform 

table of contents we have established a series of relationships with systems integrators and hardware platform  software and service providers 
we have derived  and anticipate that we will continue to derive  a substantial portion of our revenues from customers that have significant relationships with our integration and platform partners 
as a result of continuing consolidation in the telecommunications and information delivery industries and the reduction in capital available for emerging companies  we expect to derive an increasing portion of our total revenues from large telecommunications and information service providers 
the company continues to focus on increasing the number of arrangements where license and services fees are combined and payments are scheduled over an extended period as services are provided 
to date  the company has not entered into a significant number of these arrangements 
one of the impacts of this change in license structuring could be that license revenue would be recognized ratably as payments from customers become due or as services are completed rather than being recorded as revenue upon delivery 
the portion of our total revenues that is derived from international operations has increased in recent years 
as a result  we will face greater exposure to the risks associated with international operations 
we believe that in the future a larger portion of our services revenues will be based on fixed price contracts and that our future contracts will contain a larger component of engineering services 
this could result in a higher portion of revenue being recognized under the proportional performance method or increase the risk of delays in achieving contractual milestones 
in addition  our margins and overall profitability on fixed price contracts is more difficult to estimate than on time and materials contracts 
for a description of factors that may affect our future results see risks associated with our business and future operating results 
we have adopted a week fiscal accounting year commencing with our fiscal year 
each quarter will consist of weeks ending on a friday 
our fiscal year began on february   the day following the last day of our fiscal year  and ended on january  accordingly  all references as of and for the period ended january  reflect amounts as of and for the period ended january  the year ended january  was comprised of days while the year ended january  was comprised of days 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on a regular basis  we evaluate and may revise our estimates  including those related to the allowance for doubtful accounts  non marketable investments  long lived assets and goodwill and accrued restructuring expenses 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition portal recognizes revenue in accordance with current generally accepted accounting principles that have been prescribed for the software industry 
revenue recognition requirements are very complex and are affected by interpretations of the rules and industry practices  both of which are subject to change 
portal follows specific and detailed guidelines in measuring revenue  however  certain judgments and current interpretations of rules and guidelines affect the application of its revenue recognition policy 
revenue from license fees is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of the product has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
one of the critical judgments we make is our assessment of the probability of collecting the related accounts receivable balance on a customer by customer basis 
as a result  the timing or amount of revenue recognition may have been different if different assessments of the probability of 
table of contents collection had been made at the time the transactions were recorded in revenue 
in cases where collectibility is not deemed probable  revenue is recognized upon receipt of cash  assuming all other criteria have been met 
we are also required to exercise judgment in determining whether the fixed and determinable fee criteria have been met by evaluating the risk of our granting a concession to our customers  particularly when payments terms are beyond our normal credit period of to days 
for multiple element arrangements that include software products  we allocate and defer revenue for the undelivered elements based on their vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value  which is generally the price charged when that element is sold separately 
we are required to exercise judgment in determining whether vsoe exists for each undelivered element and to determine whether and when each element has been delivered 
we believe that we have sufficient consistency of pricing for each undelivered element and we periodically perform analyses to support our assertion that vsoe has been maintained 
if we were to change any of these assumptions or judgments  it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period 
for fixed price contracts on consulting services we recognize revenue on a proportional performance basis as determined by the relationship of contract costs incurred to date and the estimated total contract costs  subject to meeting agreed upon milestones 
estimated total contract costs are regularly reviewed during the life of the contract 
the recognition of services revenue based on a proportional performance basis involves an estimation process and is subject to risks and uncertainties inherent in projecting future events 
a number of internal and external factors can affect our estimates  including the nature of the services being performed  the complexity of the customer s information technology environment and the utilization and efficiency of our professional services employees 
recognized revenues and profit are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion 
revisions in profit estimates are charged to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts is established through a charge to general and administrative expenses 
this allowance is for estimated losses resulting from our customers inability to make required payments 
it is a significant estimate and is regularly evaluated for adequacy by taking into consideration factors such as past experience  credit quality of the customer  age of the receivable balance  individually and in the aggregate  and current economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay 
the use of different estimates or assumptions could produce different allowance balances 
our customer base is highly concentrated in the telecommunications and information service provider industries 
several of the leading companies in these industries have experienced financial difficulty 
if collection is not probable at the time the transaction is consummated  we do not recognize revenue until cash is collected 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
long lived assets we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets and intangible assets  whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
when impairment indicators are identified  the estimated future net undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset are compared to the asset s carrying amount to determine if impairment has occurred 
if such assets are deemed impaired  an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the assets is recognized 
if quoted market prices for the assets are not available  the fair value is calculated using the present value of estimated net cash flows 
the cash flow calculations are based on management s best estimates  using appropriate assumptions and projections at the time 
accrued restructuring expenses during the fiscal years ended january  and  we implemented restructuring plans that were a combination of reductions in workforce  consolidations of facilities and the write off of assets 
the restructuring 
table of contents charges were based on actual and estimated costs incurred in connection with these restructuring plans 
these estimates have been impacted by the rules governing the termination of employees  especially those in foreign countries 
we have accrued restructuring charges for lease commitments  net of estimated projected sublease income  for the various facilities included as part of the restructuring 
the assumptions we have made are based on the current market conditions in the various areas we have vacant space and necessarily entail a high level of management judgment 
these market conditions can fluctuate greatly due to such factors as changes in property occupancy rates  the rental prices charged for comparable properties and the general economic condition of the areas in which our facilities are located 
these changes could materially affect our accrual 
if  in future periods  it is determined that we have over accrued restructuring charges for the consolidation of facilities  the reversal of such over accrual would have a favorable impact on our financial statements in the period this was determined and would be recorded as a credit to restructuring costs 
conversely  if it is determined that our accrual is insufficient  an additional charge would have an unfavorable impact on our financial statements in the period this was determined 
additionally  we recorded certain asset write offs relating to our restructuring efforts during the fiscal years ended january  and  including leasehold improvements as a result of the abandonment of various leased facilities  portal wrote off the net book values of the related leasehold improvements 
portal continued to record depreciation expense  included in operating expenses  for the leasehold improvements until it no longer occupied the facilities or portions of the facilities 
upon vacating these facilities  portal wrote off the net book value of these leasehold improvements as they were not deemed recoverable due to unfavorable sub leasing market conditions 
furniture and fixtures as a result of abandoning facilities  portal decided to also abandon furniture and fixtures in the vacated facilities or portion of the facilities 
upon vacating the facilities and abandoning the furniture and fixtures  portal wrote off the net book value of the abandoned assets 
internally used software as a result of the reductions in force  portal assessed its need for the number of licenses for software currently in use 
based on current and projected future needs  portal determined that the number of licenses purchased exceeds the actual number needed 
accordingly  portal abandoned the unused licenses and wrote off the related portion of the license fees associated with these purchased software packages 
laptop computers used by exiting employees portal wrote off the book value of its laptop computers used by exiting employees that either it did not expect to be returned by the severed employees or it expected to scrap or sell 
portal made a decision to sell the computers returned by exiting employees  as it believed that by the time it begins to experience personnel growth  the computers would be obsolete 
portal recorded the charge for the computer write offs net of expected proceeds received from the sale of computers 
as this cost is related to employees who were terminated as part of the restructuring plans  we included the charge as part of the restructuring expense 
income taxes we allocate our income losses among our parent and international subsidiaries based on a methodology that we believe is in accordance with organization for economic cooperation and development oecd guidance 
the allocation of income losses is inherently subjective 
if we were to change our allocation methodology  or if the authorities in a specific tax jurisdiction successfully disagreed with our methodology  it could cause a material increase or decrease to our provision for income taxes in a particular period 
we currently have million of deferred tax assets  mostly arising from net operating losses  tax credits  accruals and timing differences offset by a full valuation allowance 
we believe there is sufficient uncertainty regarding the realization of deferred tax assets to require a valuation allowance 
these factors include consideration of past operating losses  the competitive nature of our market and the unpredictability of future operating results 
therefore  we continue to provide a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets as of 
table of contents january  we will continue to assess our ability to realize tax benefits available to us based on actual and forecasted operating results 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  each item from our consolidated statements of operations  the relative percentage that those amounts represent to consolidated revenues unless otherwise indicated and the percentage change in those amounts from period to period 
all percentages are calculated using actual amounts rounded to the nearest thousand

license fees revenues decreased in fiscal from fiscal primarily due to a decline in the volume of orders and average order size 
the decline in the average order size in fiscal has been driven by a change in our customer base  which has shifted from internet based companies to wireless operators and content providers 
sales arrangements with wireless operators and content providers have resulted in smaller initial sales of licenses and a larger amount of service fees 
services revenues increased in fiscal primarily due to increased demand for our consulting services from wireless operators and content providers 
wireless customers have purchased smaller licenses initially for 
table of contents internal purposes and then have entered into consulting engagements spanning multiple quarters prior to making a decision to purchase additional licenses to be used in a production environment based on a specific number of subscribers 
this has led to an increase in the overall volume of consulting services performed and a decrease in license revenues in fiscal our fourth quarter and fiscal revenues exclude million that we originally reported as revenues in our earnings release and conference call dated february  this revenue was associated with a customer who was  subsequent to the company s earning s release  unwilling to consent in writing that the company has fully met all of the customer s expectations under the agreement as of january  the company believes it has met and is in substantial compliance with all contractual requirements 
although the cash associated with this revenue has been received by the company and the company believes the customer has no right to a refund  the company has decided to defer such revenue to reflect the disagreement with the customer 
total revenues decreased in fiscal from fiscal primarily due to a decrease in license fees 
license fee revenues decreased in absolute amounts and as a percentage of total revenues in fiscal and primarily in the us as a result of the collapse of existing internet companies and the dramatic drop off in the formation of new communications and internet companies that might have used our product 
in addition  there was a continued general economic slowdown  and in particular  reduced capital spending by communications service providers  which all contributed to the decrease in our revenues from fiscal to fiscal service revenues decreased in fiscal from fiscal due to a decline in maintenance renewals as a result of customer terminations and the collapse of our internet customer base that had not fully been replaced by new customer contracts  along with a reduction in consulting services revenue as result of fewer new customer implementations 
affiliates majority owned by vodafone group plc vodafone  as publicly reported by vodafone  accounted for  and of total revenues during fiscal   and  respectively 
no individual vodafone affiliate or other customer accounted for more than of revenues during fiscal or fiscal one individual customer  america online  inc  accounted for of total revenues during fiscal the following table shows our revenues by region year ended january  change to year ended january  change to year ended january  in millions  except percentages geographical revenues north america percentage of total revenues international europe percentage of total revenues intercontinental percentage of total revenues total international percentage of total revenues total revenues north american revenues  which are defined as revenue from the united states and canada  decreased in fiscal from fiscal and decreased in fiscal from fiscal primarily due to the shift from internet based customers to customers in the wireless industry 
north american wireless carriers largely outsource their billing applications to billing providers  and have not allocated significant funds to internal billing projects due to ongoing consolidations within the industry 
in addition  we experienced a decline in both volume of orders and our average order size in north america in fiscal when compared to fiscal revenues for emea  
table of contents defined as europe  middle east and africa increased in fiscal from fiscal and in fiscal from fiscal  primarily as a result of our success in obtaining new business with wireless and content service providers in this region 
intercontinental revenues  which are defined by us as asia pacific  japan and latin america including mexico increased in fiscal from fiscal primarily as a result of obtaining new business with a wireless provider in japan  and with wireless and cable providers in latin america 
intercontinental revenue decreased in fiscal from fiscal due primarily to a continued deferral of capital expenditures by telecommunications companies as well as a general economic slowdown in that region 
cost of license fees cost of license fees consists of resellers commission payments to systems integrators and third party royalty obligations with respect to third party technology included in portal infranet 
in fiscal compared to fiscal  these costs decreased due to a reduction in reseller commission payments 
the decrease in the cost of license fees from fiscal to is primarily due to the decreases in license revenue discussed above 
cost of services cost of services primarily consists of consulting  maintenance  and training expenses 
cost of services increased in fiscal from fiscal due to increases in headcount and increased subcontractor expense for fiscal this was largely due to the increase in our consulting revenue  which required additional headcount 
cost of services decreased in fiscal from fiscal primarily due to a reduction in our services workforce resulting from the geographic realignment of consulting and support resources 
gross margin for services was approximately  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
service gross margins are generally negatively impacted during periods of growth in service providers  such as in fiscal  due to the costs of recruiting and initial training of new employees and a temporary proportionately higher level of use of higher cost sub contractors 
the increase in the gross margin for fiscal from fiscal was primarily the result of the efficiencies achieved through reductions in our consulting workforce 
we expect margins to improve over the next year as we staff our consulting workforce and decrease the level of use of higher cost subcontractors 
amortization and impairment of purchased developed technology in fiscal year  we purchased third party software for which certain functionality was integrated into our product 
due to our restructuring plan in july  we re assessed our need for this software and we decided against further integration due to the reductions in workforce 
as a result we incurred a charge of million for the write off of the amortized balance of technology originally capitalized in connection with the purchase  in the quarter ended october   that has been included in this category in the consolidated statements of operations 
in fiscal  we recorded an asset of million for purchased developed technology as a result of acquiring solution and baygate 
purchased developed technology was being amortized  on a straight line basis  over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets of three to four years 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the value was determined by using the income approach which estimates the present value of future cash flows from developed technology based on management and industry assumptions and market data 
during fiscal  we recorded charges of million and million to reflect the impairment of purchased developed technology related to our investment in baygate and solution  respectively see reduction in intangibles due to impairment below 
as of january   purchased developed technology related to our investment in baygate was fully expensed due to a combination of impairment charges and amortization during fiscal amortization and impairment of purchased developed technology was million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
future amortization expense of the remaining purchased developed technology related to our investment in solution is estimated to be million in fiscal 
table of contents research and development expenses research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel and related costs for our development and certain technical support efforts 
research and development expenses were million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease in fiscal from fiscal is primarily due to a shift of our engineering workforce from higher cost us locations to our lower costs operations in bangalore  india 
in addition facility costs decreased as a result of our restructuring programs initiated in fiscal and the decrease in fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to a reduction in our workforce as a result of our restructuring programs 
we expect to continue to increase our bangalore based personnel 
we have not capitalized any development costs to date 
sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses consist of personnel and related costs for our direct sales force  marketing staff and marketing programs  including trade shows  advertising and costs associated with the recruitment of new and maintenance of existing  strategic partnerships 
sales and marketing expenses were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease in sales and marketing expenses in fiscal from fiscal and fiscal is primarily due to a decrease in the number of sales and marketing personnel and a reduction in facilities costs as a result of our restructuring plans initiated in fiscal and general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and related costs for general corporate functions  including finance  accounting  legal and human resources  as well as information system and facilities expenses not allocated to other departments 
general and administrative expenses were million  million  and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses decreased in fiscal due to decreases in headcount related costs of million  decreased expenses of million for consultants who assisted in various general and administrative related functions  decreased travel and other miscellaneous expenses of million  offset by increases in legal and audit fees of million and a reduction in credits recorded to bad debt expense of million 
general and administrative expenses decreased in fiscal from fiscal primarily as a result of a reduction in bad debt expense of million 
this included a reversal of million of accruals no longer considered necessary in fiscal additionally  general and administrative expenses declined due to reductions in personnel  facilities costs and depreciation expenses resulting from the restructuring plans initiated in fiscal and our policy has been to maintain accounts receivable allowances based on specifically identified credit concerns and on our historical experience of delinquencies 
during  we determined that a protracted business deterioration in a class of our customers was impacting their ability to make payments when due 
accordingly  we determined that an increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts was required 
in fiscal  as a result of better than anticipated collections and more stringent credit policies  no additions to bad debt expense were required and the allowance for doubtful accounts was decreased for the write off of uncollectible amounts 
during  the allowance was decreased due to the write off of uncollectible amounts 
stock compensation charges in fiscal  the compensation committee of the board of directors approved a plan to reprice stock options for continuing employees excluding the chief executive officer and members of the board of directors 
under this repricing plan  approximately  outstanding options with an exercise price greater than per share the closing market price on the date of repricing were repriced to an exercise price of per share 
these repriced options became subject to variable accounting resulting in a stock compensation charge of million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents we recorded deferred stock compensation of approximately million in fiscal in connection with stock options and restricted stock issued in and prior to we recorded deferred stock compensation of million in fiscal in connection with the acquisition of baygate 
the deferred stock compensation reflects the difference between the exercise prices of options granted to acquire certain shares of common stock and the deemed fair value for financial reporting purposes of our common stock on their respective grant dates 
we amortized deferred compensation expense of approximately million and million during fiscal years and  respectively 
this compensation expense relates to options awarded to individuals in all operating expense categories 
there was no deferred compensation remaining at january  and january  the following table shows the amounts of stock compensation charges that would have been recorded under the following expense categories if it had not been separately stated on the consolidated statements of operations in thousands years ended january  cost of services research and development sales and marketing general and administrative amortization of goodwill goodwill related to the acquisition of solution accounted for approximately and of total assets and stockholders equity  respectively  as of january  in fiscal  amortization expense of goodwill was million 
during fiscal  we recorded impairment charges to goodwill totaling million see reduction in intangibles due to impairment below and further reduced goodwill by million due to the reversal of excess accrued direct acquisition costs 
there was no goodwill balance as of january  or reduction in intangibles due to impairment long lived assets and intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
on at least an annual basis  the estimated future net undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset are compared to the asset s carrying amount to determine if impairment has occurred 
if such assets were deemed impaired  an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the assets is recognized 
if quoted market prices for the assets are not available  the fair value is calculated using the present value of estimated expected future net cash flows 
the cash flow calculations are based on management s best estimates  using assumptions and projections it deemed appropriate at the time 
during the quarter ended october   we recorded a charge of million in impairment of assets related to computer equipment and software that we abandoned 
of the total impairment charge  million was related to third party software for which some of the functionality was previously integrated into our product 
due to the reductions in the workforce  portal re assessed its need for this third party software and abandoned it when the related resources to integrate and maintain the software were eliminated 
the impairment of this software is included in amortization and impairment of purchased developed technology in the consolidated statements of operations 
the remaining million in impairment of assets is included in impairment of long lived assets in the consolidated statements of operations 
during the fiscal year ended january   we identified indicators of possible impairment of the intangible assets arising from our acquisitions 
these indicators included deterioration in the business climate and prospects and intentions for these subsidiaries  implying that the downturn may be for a long period of time 

table of contents as related to our acquisition of solution  the indicators of impairment included the other than temporary decline in market values of technology companies in general and portal specifically 
our stock price experienced a steady decline over the course of several quarters  with a slight rebound at the end of the first quarter of fiscal the slight rebound in stock prices appeared to indicate a temporary decline in market values  but the stock continued on a downward trend in the second quarter of fiscal had solution been an independent company  we concluded that its valuation would have declined in a similar manner to ours based on the similarity of products  target markets and declining revenue 
additionally  in the second quarter of fiscal the forecasted revenue for solution products deteriorated significantly from the forecasts made at the time of the acquisition 
in connection with our restructuring plans see restructuring costs below and note of notes to consolidated financial statements  we planned to reduce our headcount overseas which included many solution employees and cancelled research and development activities related to the solution product  both of which were a result of an other than temporary deterioration in business climate and a drastic reduction in forecasted revenue opportunities 
we measured the impairment loss related to intangible assets based on the amount by which the carrying amount of such assets exceeded its fair value 
in  our total reduction in intangibles  including goodwill and identified intangible assets  due to impairment was million 
this consisted of several charges  including charges related to solution and baygate 
for solution  measurement of fair value was based on an analysis of the future discounted cash flows at the solution level 
the analysis indicated that our long lived assets for solution were impaired by an amount totaling million 
accordingly  we recorded an impairment write down of this amount during the second quarter of fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we identified additional indicators of impairment of our remaining solution intangible assets 
as a result  we recorded charges of million and million to reflect the full impairment of goodwill and purchased developed technology  respectively  related to our investment 
due to the lack of revenues generated from baygate products together with the october reduction of workforce associated with baygate s product  we cancelled the further planned development of baygate related products 
based on these key factors  we recorded a charge of million during fiscal  to reflect the impairment of purchased developed technology related to our investment in baygate 
in the fourth quarter of  we issued  additional shares valued at million to the former solution stockholders under the terms of the original purchase agreement 
the value of these shares was deemed impaired in the same quarter they were issued  resulting in an additional impairment charge during the quarter of million 
restructuring costs in july  our board of directors approved and we began implementation of a plan to change our operations and cost structure to more fully align our structure with market conditions and our increased focus on satisfying the needs of diversified business strategy telecommunications service providers 
the plan included a reduction in workforce of approximately employees  facilities reductions and asset write offs 
we recorded restructuring charges of million and million for the quarters ended july  and october   respectively 
the restructuring charges included approximately million of severance related amounts  million of committed excess facility lease payments net of estimated sublease income  million in asset write offs and million for other costs 
additionally  we had integrated certain functionality of third party software into our product 
due to the reduced labor resources associated with the restructuring  we abandoned and wrote off the software 
in may and october  portal s board of directors approved plans to reduce our cost structure as a result of a change in market conditions 
the plans were a combination of reductions in our workforce  consolidations of facilities and asset write offs 
the workforce reductions affected all of our functional areas and all affected employees were notified prior to the end of the respective quarters 
as a result of the restructuring plans  we incurred charges of million  million and million  in the quarters ended july   october  and january   respectively 

table of contents the may plan reduced our workforce by approximately employees 
the million restructuring charge incurred during the quarter ended july  included approximately million of severance related amounts  million of committed excess facilities  primarily related to lease expenses net of anticipated sublease income  and million in asset write offs 
the october plan reduced our workforce by approximately employees 
the million and million charges in the quarters ended october  and january   respectively  included approximately million of severance related amounts  million of committed excess facilities  primarily related to lease expenses net of estimated sublease income  and million in asset write offs 
as of january   the remaining restructuring accruals were million of which million represents committed excess facilities  net of anticipated sublease income  million for severance related costs and million for other restructuring related costs 
during fiscal  the company recorded reclassification adjustments to previously recorded restructuring estimates totaling million  primarily due to sublease income and final severance settlement costs in certain european countries exceeding our original estimates 
as of january   the remaining restructuring accruals were million  of which million represented committed excess facilities  net of anticipated sublease income  million for severance related costs and million for other restructuring related costs 
as of january   the remaining restructuring reserves were million  of which million represented committed excess facilities  net of estimated sublease income  million severance related costs  million for asset write offs and million for other restructuring related costs see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
severance payments are expected to be paid through the first quarter of fiscal and payments for the excess facilities are expected to occur through while we believe that our business realignment will assist us in streamlining operations  reducing expenses and achieving profitability  there is no assurance that we will achieve these anticipated results 
we may in the future take additional actions  including further changes to the business organization  in order to realign the business with anticipated requirements 
if we are not successful in realigning our business to increase revenues and decrease costs  we may not achieve profitability 
interest and other income interest and other income  net includes foreign currency exchange gain  interest and dividend income from cash  cash equivalents and investments offset by interest expense paid on capital leases and notes payable 
interest and other income  net was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
interest income was million  million and million  respectively 
the decrease in interest income during fiscal was due to declining interest rates 
the decrease in interest income during fiscal was due to declining interest rates and a declining investment balance 
net foreign currency exchange gain was million  million  and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
the gain in foreign currency exchange increased in fiscal due to a decline in the us dollar during the period 
write down of impaired investments in fiscal  we held non marketable securities of three private companies  each with a cost basis of million 
during fiscal  two of the three companies demonstrated cash burn rates significantly in excess of their respective working capital levels and their anticipated access to funding 
further  both companies were in loss positions and  despite efforts to reduce their respective spending levels  continued to record losses due to slow growing revenues 
considering the downturn in the economy  we believed that it would be difficult for the companies to obtain additional financing 
consequently  we believed that these were sufficient indicators that these non marketable investments experienced other than temporary declines in value 
as we did not foresee these investments generating any value or cash in the foreseeable future  and as such did not foresee the investments returning to the valuation levels at the time of portal s initial investment  we deemed the decline in value to be other than temporary and consequently wrote off the million of cost in fiscal 
table of contents provision for income taxes the income tax provision was million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
the income tax provision for each of these fiscal years primarily relates to foreign withholding taxes on revenue 
withholding taxes  when applicable  attach to gross income regardless of overall profitability 
we recorded net losses of million  million  and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
these worldwide losses were allocated among portal and it s subsidiaries in accordance with our transfer pricing policies which we believe are in accordance with oecd guidance 
however  this guidance is inherently subjective and in some jurisdictions income taxes have been paid or accrued 
we believe there is sufficient uncertainty regarding the realization of our deferred tax assets to require a valuation allowance 
these factors include consideration of past operating results  the competitive nature of our market and the unpredictability of future operating results 
therefore  we continue to reserve our deferred tax assets as of january  we will continue to assess our ability to realize tax benefits available to us based on actual and forecasted operating results 
liquidity and capital resources we have generated net losses from operations during the past several years 
our operations have largely been funded by our sale of common stock 
in  we raised million through the sale of common stock in a registered offering 
the proceeds of this stock offering were partially used to fund our operating losses incurred in and fund our restructuring efforts 
we may continue to generate operating losses in the future which may require us to raise additional capital 
we believe we have adequate funds to meet our operating needs for the next twelve months 
cash  cash equivalents and investments including restricted investments of million and million as of january  and january   respectively totaled million at january   compared to a balance of million at january  we used cash totaling million in operations during the year ended january   a decrease of million from the million used in the year ended january  net cash used in operations during fiscal was primarily comprised of an increase in accounts receivable of million  a decrease in other accrued liabilities of million  and an increase in deferred revenue of million 
in fiscal  adjustments made for non cash expenses  including depreciation  amortization  stock compensation charges  and amortization of purchased intangibles amounted to million 
in fiscal  adjustments made for non cash expenses  including depreciation  amortization  stock compensation charges  amortization of purchased intangibles and goodwill  reduction in intangibles due to impairment  non cash restructuring costs  and write down of impaired investments amounted to million 
the increase in accounts receivable for fiscal was primarily due to the growth in revenues for fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease in other accrued liabilities was primarily due to lease payments for facilities included in accrued restructuring costs 
the increase in deferred revenue was due to growth in initial maintenance contracts and increases in deferred consulting as more customers have entered into agreements with larger consulting components 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended january   a decrease of million from the million provided by investing activities in the year ended january  net cash used in investing activities for fiscal years and primarily reflected net purchase activity in short and long term investments 
during the year ended january   we purchased computer equipment and software  made leasehold improvements and purchased other capital equipment amounting to approximately million  primarily to support our ongoing operations and information systems 
historically  we have also used debt and leases to partially finance our operations and capital purchases 
no capital leases were entered into during fiscal 
table of contents the million of cash provided by financing activities for fiscal primarily related to the issuance of common stock in a registered offering completed in september the transaction involved the sale of  shares of common stock at per share 
portal received proceeds of million net of million in placement agent fees and other offering costs 
the remainder of the cash provided by financing activities for fiscal was primarily due to the issuance of common stock related to our stock incentive plans  partially offset by the repayment of notes payable 
the total future cash outlay for the restructuring plans enacted in fiscal and is currently estimated to be approximately million  which includes severance related costs as well as lease liabilities related to the consolidation of facilities and is expected to be funded by available cash 
lease payments for impacted facilities  net of expected sublease income  are expected to be million and will be paid out through in the normal course of business  we enter into leases for facilities in both domestic and international locations 
these leases are for terms expiring from september through march in connection with our facility leases  we issued letters of credit in lieu of a security deposit for the facilities see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
due to the restructuring activities that occurred during fiscal and  several facilities were vacated or are underutilized 
some of these facilities have been subleased 
we are also attempting to sublease additional surplus facilities comprising approximately  square feet 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations  including related interest charges  as of january  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
of the million in non cancelable operating leases  net of sublease income  million has been included in accrued restructuring expenses as of january  in thousands 
total less than year years years over years long term notes payable non cancelable operating leases  net of sublease income the following table summarizes our other commitments as of january  and the effect such commitments could have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods if the letters of credit or the guarantees were drawn upon 
restricted investments represent the collateral for these commitments 
in thousands 
total less than year years over years letters of credit guarantees our capital requirements depend on numerous factors  including the timing of customer orders and engagements  and related obligations and payments  market acceptance of our products  the resources we devote to developing  marketing  selling and supporting our products  the timing and extent of changes in the size of our operations and other factors 
our planned expense levels for each of the fiscal quarters of fiscal exceed the revenues we generated in the fourth quarter of fiscal as a result  we will need to generate increased revenues from licenses of our products and sale of our services to achieve and maintain operating profitability 
we believe that our current cash balances and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next months 
however  we may seek financing at any time that we determine market conditions are favorable 
additional funding  if needed  may cause dilution to our stockholders or the incurrence of debt and such funding may not be available on terms acceptable to us  or at all 

table of contents risks associated with our business and future operating results our future operating results may vary substantially from period to period 
the price of our common stock will fluctuate in the future and an investment in our common stock is subject to a variety of risks  including but not limited to the specific risks identified below

our revenues may continue to be adversely affected as a result of economic and political conditions affecting our target markets we primarily market our products and services to providers of telecommunications and information services 
during the past few years  the telecommunications industry has experienced a difficult economic environment 
the substantial number of business failures and the decline in the market value of dot com and other technology companies in the past few years has made it more difficult for emerging communication and electronic content companies to obtain financing for their operations 
moreover  the market value  financial results and prospects of many large and established companies  including many large telecommunications companies  have also declined or degraded significantly 
many communications and content companies have significantly reduced their expenditures and have reduced or deferred their purchases of software and related products and the introduction of many new communication services has been delayed or cancelled 
cancellations of existing or planned services also adversely impact our potential professional service  maintenance and support revenues 
reductions in spending by these companies have resulted in intense competition for their available spending and increased price competition and reductions for products and professional services 
any general decrease by our customers and potential customers in their rate of software and network investments results in a significant decrease in our revenues and operating income 
these trends in technology and software spending dramatically impacted our business in fiscal  and and will continue to adversely affect our business until conditions improve 
in addition  even after business conditions improve  our customers and potential customers may continue to demand price discounts and other benefits 
in addition  political instability in various geographic areas has resulted in companies reducing spending for technology projects generally and the delay or reconsideration of potential purchases of our products and related services 
the war on terrorism and in iraq and the potential for war or other hostilities in various parts of the world continues to contribute to a climate of economic and political uncertainty and low consumer confidence that has adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our revenue growth and results of operations 

table of contents we expect to incur additional losses and cannot be certain that we will be profitable or generate positive cash flow in order to be profitable or generate positive cash flow  we must significantly increase our revenues or further reduce our expenses 
we may not be able to increase or even maintain our revenues and we may not achieve sufficient revenues to attain profitability in any future period 
moreover  we have already significantly reduced our expenses through a series of restructurings and there may be a limit to our ability to further reduce expenses without significantly damaging our operational capabilities 
we incurred net losses of approximately million  million  and million for fiscal years  and  respectively 
the decrease in capital expenditures by telecommunications companies as well as the general economic slowdown has adversely affected our revenues and will make it difficult to increase revenues until spending in our target markets increases 
we also expect that we will face increased competition that may make it more difficult to increase our revenues 
even if we are able to increase revenues  we have experienced and may continue to experience price competition that would lower our gross margins and reduce our ability to become profitable 
the company continues to focus on increasing the number of arrangements where license and services fees are combined and payments are scheduled over an extended period as services are provided 
to date  the company has not entered into a significant number of these arrangements 
one of the impacts of this change in license structuring would be that license revenue would be recognized ratably over the term of the license arrangement or as payments from customers become due  or as services or our solutions are accepted rather than being recorded as revenue upon delivery of the license 
such a change may significantly delay the timing of our revenue recognition and could decrease our revenues in the short term 
an increase in the percentage of our revenues that is derived from indirect channels and from services  both of which have lower margins than our license revenues  could increase gross margin dollars and may decrease our gross margin percentage 
in addition  our planned expense levels for each of the fiscal quarters of fiscal exceed the revenues we generated in the fourth quarter of fiscal we cannot be certain that we will achieve operating or net profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
additionally  failure to achieve a positive cash flow will continue to result in reductions in our existing cash resources 
our quarterly revenue is generated from a limited number of customers and our customer base is concentrated  the loss of one or more of our customers or prospective customers could cause our business to suffer a substantial portion of our license and services revenues in any given quarter has been  and is expected to continue to be  generated from a limited number of customers with large financial commitments 
for example  affiliates majority owned by vodafone group plc vodafone  as publicly reported by vodafone  accounted for of revenue recognized during fiscal as a result  if a large contract is cancelled or deferred or an anticipated contract does not materialize  our business would be harmed 
for example  in the third quarter of  a number of anticipated contracts did not occur within the quarter  which adversely affected our financial results for that period 
our total revenues could also be adversely affected if revenues from a significant customer in one period are not replaced with revenues from that customer or other customers in subsequent periods 
the telecommunication and information service provider industries we have targeted are consolidating  which could reduce the number of potential customers available to us 
moreover  many of our customers may have purchased sufficient quantities of our products to satisfy their current or anticipated requirements 
a few of our large telecommunications customers own or have an interest in companies in numerous countries and to varying degrees may control or influence the buying decisions of those affiliated companies 
in the event one customer decides not to purchase our products  the decision may adversely affect our ability to market our products and services to that company s affiliates  which may be existing or potential customers of ours 
because there are a limited number of customers and competition for them is intense  these customers have substantial bargaining power to negotiate terms and conditions favorable to the customer 
any of the foregoing could cause our business to suffer in the future 

table of contents it is difficult to predict the timing of individual orders and revenues because our solution has complex  long and variable sales cycles and implementation periods the sales cycle for our solution varies greatly  generally ranging between to months 
sales cycles have recently lengthened as the competitive environment has become more intense  the financial position of our potential customers has weakened and price discounting has further delayed customer decision processes 
our sales cycles are also typically longer with larger customers such as national and international telecommunications companies 
along with systems integrators and our other distribution partners  we spend significant time educating and providing information to our prospective customers regarding the use and benefits of our solution 
customers increasingly require vendors to perform proof of concept projects and performance benchmarks as a part of the sales cycles 
these tests can further lengthen sales cycles and increase our sales costs 
the long sales and implementation cycles for our solution make it more difficult to predict our future financial results and may cause license revenues and operating results to vary significantly from period to period 
even after purchase  our customers tend to deploy our solution slowly and deliberately  depending on the specific technical capabilities of the customer  the size of the deployment  the complexity of the customer s network environment and the quantity of hardware and the degree of hardware configuration necessary to deploy our solution 
the length of time to implement and deploy systems involving our solution may have an impact on the timing and amount of revenues ultimately received from customers  particularly if payments are tied to implementation or production milestones 
for example  in the third quarter of fiscal year  failure to obtain acceptance of certain milestones during the quarter reduced the amount of revenue recognizable during the quarter 
as a result  the revenues derived from a sale may not be recognized immediately and could be spread over an extended period 
as a result  an increase in the period of time over which revenue is recognized may cause a decline in the amount of revenues in the short term 
our inability to sublease or reduce surplus office space would increase our use of cash and operating expenses and adversely effect operating results and our financial condition we must periodically acquire and dispose of our office facilities in various locations as the number of existing and projected employee s changes for those locations or as existing leases expire 
securing and building out facilities takes significant lead time 
historically  because of the need to satisfy projected future expansion  the amount of space we leased was generally more than the amount required at the time 
our significant office leases have terms of between and years 
as a result  we frequently attempt to sublease the portions of leased facilities that we have leased but do not currently need 
in addition  our reductions in our workforce undertaken over the past two years have substantially reduced our facilities requirements in several locations 
as a result  we are attempting to sublease the facilities that we have previously leased but do not currently need or to negotiate reductions in our rent obligations relating to those facilities or cancellations of the applicable leases 
we have leased approximately  square feet for our headquarters facilities in cupertino  california through the amounts leased significantly exceed our current requirements and we intend to sublease a majority of the facilities for a substantial portion  if not the entire balance  of the lease term 
there is currently a large amount of vacant commercial real estate in the san francisco bay area and in other locations where we have facilities 
moreover  currently prevailing rental rates in many locations  including the san francisco bay area  are significantly lower than those that we are obligated to pay under the leases 
we may therefore continue to encounter significant difficulties or delays in subleasing our surplus space and will likely not be able to sublease it for rents equal to those that we are obligated to pay 
in connection with our restructuring plan adopted in fiscal  we have vacated additional facilities in the united states and in other locations 
to the extent that we are unable to renegotiate the terms or cancel the applicable leases or to sublease this and other surplus space at an amount equal to or greater than our rent obligations for that space or to the extent sublessees fail to perform their obligations to pay rent  we could incur greater operating expenses than we initially anticipated or included within accrued restructuring charges 
such increases in operating expenses in a period could cause us to exceed our planned expense levels and significantly adversely affect our financial results for that period 
cancellation of leases will likely result in use of significant amounts of cash and additional 
table of contents restructuring charges 
furthermore  inability to sublease such space may adversely affect our planned uses of cash and our capital resources 
moreover  we have reduced the amount of the facilities restructuring charges we accrued by the estimated amount of sublease income 
the assumptions we have made were based on the then current market conditions  as of each reporting period  in the various areas where we have vacant space 
these market conditions can fluctuate greatly  thus causing our accrual to be inaccurate 
if  in future periods  it is determined that we have over accrued for restructuring charges related to the consolidation of facilities  the reversal of such over accrual would have a favorable impact on our financial statements in the period this was determined 
conversely  if it is determined that our accrual is insufficient  an additional charge would have a significant unfavorable impact on our financial statements in the period this was determined 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate in future periods and we may fail to meet expectations our revenues and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors 
in future quarters  our operating results may be below the expectations of one or more public market analysts and investors and the price of our common stock may fall 
failure by technology companies to meet or exceed analyst expectations or any resulting changes in analyst recommendations or ratings frequently results in substantial decreases in the market value of the stock of such companies 
factors that could cause quarterly fluctuations include variations in demand for our products and services  including decreases caused by reductions in technology spending within our target markets  the timing  execution  and revenue recognition of individual contracts  particularly large contracts that would materially affect our operating results in a given quarter  large contracts with extensive consulting services or product commitments may contain contract terms and conditions or require the use of contract accounting for revenue recognition purposes that have the effect of extending the period of time over which revenue is recognized  our ability to develop and attain market acceptance of enhancements to the portal solution and new products and services  market acceptance of new communications services that our products are intended to support  delays in introducing new products and services  delays in the completion  delivery or acceptance of milestones and deliverables  new product introductions by our competitors  changes in our pricing policies or the pricing policies of our competitors  announcements of new versions of our products that cause customers to postpone purchases of our current products  the mix of products and services sold  our ability to sublease our excess real estate or renegotiate our leases  the mix of sales channels through which our products and services are sold  the mix of domestic and international sales  costs related to acquisitions of technologies or businesses  the timing of releases of new versions of third party software and hardware products that work with our products  our ability to attract  integrate  train  retain and motivate a substantial number of sales and marketing  research and development  technical support and other management personnel with the needed competencies  
table of contents the variability of future stock based compensation charges or credits as a result of our stock option repricing during fiscal year  global economic conditions generally  as well as those specific to providers of communications and content services  and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
we have difficulty predicting the volume and timing of orders for new license transactions 
in any given quarter  our sales have involved  and we expect will continue to involve  large financial commitments from a relatively small number of customers 
as a result  the cancellation or deferral of even a small number of licenses of the portal solution would reduce our revenues  which would adversely affect our quarterly financial performance 
also  we have often booked a large amount of our sales in the last month of the quarter and often in the last week of that month 
accordingly  delays in the closing of sales near the end of a quarter could cause quarterly revenue to fall substantially short of anticipated levels 
furthermore  delays in the closing of license transactions may result in a consequential delay or loss of services revenues relating to the projects for which the software would be licensed 
while a portion of our revenues each quarter is recognized from deferred revenue relating to previously signed contracts  our quarterly performance will depend primarily upon entering into new contracts to generate revenues for that quarter 
we may not be successful in entering into contracts with new or existing customers 
new contracts that we enter into may not result in revenue in the quarter in which the contract is signed and we may not be able to predict accurately when revenues from these contracts will be recognized 
we determine our operating expenses largely on the basis of anticipated revenue trends and a high percentage of our expenses are fixed in the short and medium term 
as a result  a failure or delay in generating or recognizing revenue could cause significant variations in our operating results from quarter to quarter and could result in substantial operating losses 
if the market for our products does not improve  we may be forced to incur additional restructuring charges during the fiscal year ended january  and the quarters ended july  and october  we incurred charges of million  million and million  respectively  in connection with restructuring plans implemented to reduce our cost structure 
these restructuring plans were implemented in response to the continued global deferral of capital expenditures by telecommunications companies  as well as the general downturn in the economy 
if the poor market environment for telecommunications and content service providers continues and capital expenditures continue to be deferred or our business otherwise continues to suffer  we may implement additional restructuring plans to further reduce our cost structure and incur additional restructuring charges 
these restructuring plans may not achieve or only partially achieve the desired benefits 
any additional restructuring charges could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
the markets in which we sell our product are highly competitive and we may not be able to compete effectively we compete in markets that are intensely competitive and rapidly changing 
we face competition from providers of customer management and billing software  such as amdocs ltd  convergys corporation  and csg systems international  inc and we also compete with systems integrators and with internal information technology departments of larger communications providers 
most of our current principal competitors have significantly more personnel and greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than we have 
many of our competitors also have more diversified businesses  established reputations in particular market segments  larger customer bases and are not as dependent on customers in our target market 

table of contents our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements than we can 
intense competition has recently been exemplified by deep price discounting by our competitors that has resulted in a lengthening of our sales cycles  and price reductions and may threaten our ability to close forecasted business 
additionally  our financial strength or that of a competitor is a significant factor considered by many potential customers in their vendor selections 
because many of our competitors have greater financial resources than we do  this can adversely affect our selection by potential customers 
increased competition can result in price reductions  fewer customer orders  reduced gross margins and loss of market share  any of which would harm our business 
our failure to develop and market products and services that compete successfully with those of other suppliers in the market would harm our business 
we anticipate that the market for our products and services will remain intensely competitive 
rapid changes in demand for our services can increase our costs and adversely affect our margins and profitability services contracts can require that we rapidly provide qualified consulting personnel in particular locations 
in addition  such personnel may be required to have particular language speaking abilities and technical skills 
recruitment and training of qualified personnel can take significant time and expense 
to meet rapidly changing requirements for personnel  we may need to relocate personnel from one geographic area to another which can result in increased costs 
in some cases  we may choose to satisfy resource requirements by retaining subcontractors where the cost may exceed the cost of using our employees 
in addition  we may experience declines in the rates we are able to charge customers in certain locations due to local market conditions and competitive factors 
all these factors may increase the costs of performing services and reduce margins for services 
failure to provide adequate consulting services to our customers could result in loss of revenue  damaged customer relationships or financial penalties 
as a result  if we experience difficulties in managing the size  location and availability of our services workforce  our revenues  profitability and business will suffer 
fixed price services engagements can impact our profitability if we fail to complete them within the estimated budget we perform some of our professional services engagements on a fixed price basis 
if the project requires more labor or products than was estimated by us in determining the fixed price agreed to with the customer  our margins and profitability could be adversely affected 
in addition  failure to complete services as required or to obtain written acceptance of completed milestones may result in deferral of revenue until such completion or acceptance occurs and may cause revenues to be recognized in periods other than as initially expected or forecast 
our operating plans rely on our ability to successfully increase the size and scope of our operations in india and a failure to manage that process and organization could adversely affect our operations in fiscal we opened an engineering center in bangalore  india 
in fiscal we significantly increased the size of this organization and expanded its scope 
the expansion of this organization is an important component of our strategy to address the business needs of our customers  increase our revenues and achieve profitability 
a portion of the personnel in this organization are our employees but a substantial majority of the personnel is provided through an independent contractor 
the success of this operation will depend on our ability and our independent contractor s ability to attract  train  assimilate and retain sufficient highly qualified personnel in the required periods 
a disruption of our relationship with the independent contractor would adversely impact the effectiveness of the india organization and could adversely affect our operations and financial results 
failure to effectively manage and integrate these operations will harm our business and financial results 

table of contents our quarterly operating results may fluctuate in future periods due to seasonal variations and we may fail to meet expectations we may also experience seasonality in our business 
in many software companies  the rate of growth or absolute amount of license fee revenues tends to decline from the fourth quarter of one year to the first quarter of the next year  due in part to the structure of sales compensation plans 
our revenue in the first quarter of fiscal and was significantly lower than the preceding fourth quarter 
if we experience such seasonality in the future our rate of growth or absolute revenues could decline in the first quarter of a fiscal year compared to the preceding fourth quarter 
such seasonality may cause our results of operations to fluctuate or become more difficult to predict and could cause us to fail to meet internal or analyst expected financial results 
our significant international operations make us much more susceptible to risks from international operations for fiscal and  we derived approximately and of our revenue  respectively  from sales outside north america 
in addition  in fiscal we opened an engineering center in bangalore  india 
as a result  we face risks from doing business internationally  including  among others reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  licenses  tariffs and other trade barriers  fluctuations in the value of local currencies relative to the us dollar and greater difficulties in collecting accounts receivable  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  longer sales and payment cycles  political and economic instability  seasonal reductions in business activity  terrorism  war or the potential for hostilities  potentially adverse tax consequences  compliance with a wide variety of complex foreign laws and treaties other circumstances  such as epidemics for example  sars or natural disasters affecting the applicable area or that have a dampening effect on international business or travel  and variance and unexpected changes in local laws and regulations 
we currently have offices in a number of foreign locations including australia  canada  china  france  germany  india  italy  japan  malaysia  poland  singapore  spain  south korea  taiwan and the united kingdom and may establish additional facilities in other parts of the world 
expansion of our existing international operations and entry into additional international markets will require significant management attention and financial resources 
we cannot be certain that our investments in establishing facilities in other countries will produce desired levels of revenue 
historically  we have typically denominated most of our international license revenues in us dollars 
because our foreign currency denominated revenues have been minimal  we have not engaged in currency hedging activities 
commencing in fiscal  we denominated a larger number of international transactions in euros and certain other currencies see also impact of foreign currency rate changes in item quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk below 
as a result  we will face greater exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 
in order to reduce the effect of foreign currency fluctuations  we may hedge our exposure on certain transactional balances 
table of contents that are denominated in foreign currencies through the use of foreign currency forward exchange contracts 
failure to effectively hedge foreign currency fluctuations would adversely affect our financial results 
to the extent that we are unable to successfully manage our international business or if any of the foregoing risks should occur  our business could be adversely affected 
our historical and current revenues and earnings could be adversely affected as a result of future changes in the rules and interpretations of those rules by the sec and other accounting authorities as well as political responses to the rules promulgation process over the past several years  the american institute of certified public accountants has issued statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  and sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
in addition  in december  the securities and exchange commission staff issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition which explains how the sec staff believes existing revenue recognition rules should be applied to or interpreted for transactions not specifically addressed by existing rules 
these standards address software revenue recognition matters from a conceptual level and include implementation guidance 
the issuance of new interpretations could lead to unanticipated reductions in recognized revenue 
they could also drive significant adjustments to our business practices  including the terms of our agreements with our customers  which could result in increased administrative costs  lengthened sales cycles and other changes which could adversely affect our reported revenues and results of operations 
we believe that our revenue has been recognized in compliance with sop  sop and sab in addition  we currently account for the issuance of stock options under apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
certain proposals related to treating the grant of an employee stock option as an expense are currently under consideration by accounting standards organizations and governmental authorities 
if such proposals are adopted  our earnings could be negatively impacted 
as a result  we may decide to reduce the number of stock options granted to employees or to grant options to fewer employees 
this could affect our ability to retain existing employees and attract qualified candidates  and increase the cash compensation we would have to pay them 
our business will suffer dramatically if we fail to successfully plan and manage changes in the size of our operations our ability to successfully offer our products and services in a rapidly evolving market requires an effective planning and management process 
we have experienced rapid changes in our number of employees in recent years 
on february   we had employees compared to on february  and on march  in calendar  we plan to significantly increase the number of employees and contractors in our india operations 
these changes and reorganizations and realignment of personnel have placed  and our anticipated future operations will continue to place  a significant strain on our management resources and our ability to train and allocate sufficient personnel resources to achieve our many objectives 
failure to effectively manage the size  location and availability of our services workforce  could adversely affect our services revenues  profitability or customer relationships 
we expect that we will need to continue to evolve our financial  personnel  and managerial controls and reporting systems and procedures and will need to continue to recruit  train and manage our worldwide work force 
this is particularly true as we continue to analyze and improve our internal controls in order to ensure we are in compliance with sec rule regarding certification and attestation of our internal controls over financial reporting 
we may need to increase our finance staff and improve our systems in order to ensure we are in compliance with this new requirement 
we expect that we will have to change our facilities in certain locations and we may face difficulties and significant expenses identifying and moving into suitable office space and subleasing or assigning any surplus space 
in addition  reduction in the number of employees can result in significant severance  administrative and legal expenses 
reductions in the number of personnel or reorganization of responsibilities from personnel in one 
table of contents organization or region to another may also adversely affect  or delay  various sales  marketing and product development programs and activities 
reductions in force may result in a temporary lack of focus and reduced productivity  may cause employees to seek alternative employment  may cause delays in product introductions  and may continue to affect revenues in future quarters 
in addition  prospects and current customers may decide to delay or not purchase our products due to perceived uncertainty caused by the reductions 
we cannot assure you that we will not reduce or otherwise adjust our workforce again in the future or that the related transition issues associated with such a reduction will not occur again 
our business will suffer dramatically if we fail to effectively manage changes in the size and scope of our operations 
our future success depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel we will continue to hire sales  support  marketing and administrative personnel as needed 
in addition  we plan to continue to increase the number of research and development personnel we employ or contract with in india 
we may not be able to attract  assimilate or retain highly qualified personnel in the future 
in particular  our financial success and our ability to increase revenues in the future depend considerably upon the productivity of our direct sales force that has historically generated a majority of our license revenues 
this productivity will depend to a large degree on our success in recruiting  training and retaining qualified direct salespeople 
our business will be harmed if we fail to hire or retain qualified personnel  or if newly hired employees  particularly salespeople  fail to develop the necessary sales skills or develop these skills more slowly than we anticipate 
our future success also depends upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key sales  marketing and support personnel in general 
disruption of travel due to disease  terrorism or civil unrest could cause our business to suffer because a substantial portion of our revenues are generated from a limited number of customers each quarter  widespread disruption of travel to a region or country in which we have large customers  prospective customers or services engagements could disrupt our ability to win or perform contracts 
such disruption could occur as a result of terrorism  such as the decline in travel following the september  attacks  of disease  such as the decline in travel to china and hong kong due to the outbreak of sars  or as a result of political unrest or war 
inability or unwillingness by our employees to travel to an affected region could adversely affect our efforts to obtain or perform contracts  which could result in the loss of revenue and cause our business to suffer 
we also use systems integrators and other strategic relationships to implement and sell the portal solution we have entered into relationships with third party systems integrators  as well as with hardware platform and software applications developers and service providers 
we have derived  and anticipate that we will continue to derive  some portion of our market opportunities and revenues from these relationships 
many of these partners also work with competing software companies and our success will depend on their willingness and ability to devote sufficient resources and efforts to marketing and resale of our products versus the products of others 
we may not be able to enter into additional  or maintain our existing  strategic relationships on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
our agreements with these parties typically are in the form of nonexclusive referral fee or reseller agreements that are effective for a limited period of time and may be renewed only by mutual agreement of both parties 
therefore  there is no guarantee that any single party will continue to market our products 
we could lose sales opportunities if we fail to work effectively with these parties or fail to grow our base of market and platform partners 
we may also be at a serious competitive disadvantage if we fail to maintain and enhance these indirect sales channels 
failure to successfully or timely implement solutions could adversely effect our financial results and prospects the implementation of customer management and billing systems can be lengthy and expensive 
delays or other problems associated with the successful completion of such projects  could result in the need to provide 
table of contents additional services or warranty work  and may have an adverse effect on the timing and amount of revenues and margins associated with such projects  as well as on customer relationships  the perception and acceptance of our products and services in our target markets generally 
our business will suffer if our software contains significant errors or our product development implementation is delayed we face possible claims and higher costs as a result of the complexity of our products and the potential for undetected errors 
due to the mission critical nature of the portal solution  undetected errors are of particular concern 
complex software  such as ours  always contains undetected errors 
the implementation of the portal solution  which we accomplish through our services division and with our partners  typically involves working with sophisticated software  computing and communications systems 
if we experience difficulties with an implementation or do not meet project milestones in a timely manner  we could be obligated to devote more customer support  engineering and other resources to a particular project and to provide these services at reduced or no cost 
moreover  some contracts subject us to financial penalties if we are unable to correct errors within the required time 
if our software contains significant undetected errors or we fail to meet our customers expectations or project milestones in a timely manner we could experience monetary penalties or contract damages  loss of or delay in revenues and loss of market share  loss of customers  failure to achieve market acceptance  diversion of development and implementation resources  injury to our reputation  increased service and warranty costs  legal actions by customers against us  and increased insurance costs 
our licenses with customers generally contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential product liability claims  such as disclaimers of warranties and limitations on liability for special  consequential and incidental damages 
in addition  our license agreements generally cap the amounts recoverable for damages to the amounts paid by the licensee to us for the product or service giving rise to the damages or to a multiple of such amounts 
however  these contractual limitations on liability may not be enforceable  in certain jurisdictions and under certain circumstances  and we may be subject to claims based on errors in our software or mistakes in performing our services including claims relating to damages to our customers internal systems 
a product liability claim  whether or not successful  could harm our business by increasing our costs  damaging our reputation and distracting our management 
our future success will depend on our ability to manage technological change the market for our products and the services they are used to support is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions  changes in customer requirements  and evolving industry standards 
future versions of hardware and software platforms embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards could render our products obsolete 
our future success will depend upon our ability to develop 
table of contents and introduce a variety of new products and product enhancements to address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers 
the portal solution is designed to work on a variety of hardware and software platforms used by our customers 
however  the portal solution may not operate correctly on evolving versions of hardware and software platforms  programming languages  database environments  accounting and other systems that our customers use 
we must constantly modify and improve our products to keep pace with changes made to these platforms and to back office applications and other systems as well as respond to meet the changing requirements of our customers 
this may result in uncertainty relating to the timing and nature of new product announcements  introductions or modifications  which may harm our business 
if we fail to modify or improve our products in response to evolving industry standards  our products could become obsolete  which would harm our business 
if we fail to release products on time or deliver solutions on time  our business will suffer in the past we have failed to release certain new products and upgrades on time and an increasing number of customers are requesting us to provide custom solutions to them to enhance the capability of the portal products 
these delays may result in customer dissatisfaction  cancellation of orders and license agreements  monetary penalties for delays in delivery  negative publicity  loss of revenues  slower market acceptance  or legal action by customers against us 
in addition  any inability to perform our services in a timely and satisfactory manner would likely have similar effects 
our business may be harmed if we are unable to develop and release our products and or solutions or perform our services in a timely manner 
our proprietary rights may be inadequately protected and there is a risk of infringement our success and ability to compete depend substantially upon our internally developed technology  which we protect through a combination of patent  copyright  trade secret and trademark law 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology or to develop products with the same functionality as our products 
in addition  current or former employees may seek employment with our business partners  customers or competitors 
although our employees are required to sign confidentiality agreements at the time of hire  we cannot assure you that the confidential nature of certain proprietary information will be maintained in the course of such future employment 
policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our technology  particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
others may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology 
moreover  as the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps  we expect that our software products may in the future become subject to third party infringement claims 
some of our competitors in the market for cm b software may have filed or may intend to file patent applications covering aspects of their technology upon which they may claim our technology infringes 
any litigation  brought by us or by others  could be time consuming and costly and could divert the attention of our technical and management personnel 
in addition  litigation could cause product shipment delays or require us to develop non infringing technology or enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
such royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all  and could have a material and adverse impact on our gross margins and profitability 
if a successful claim of product infringement were made against us  our business could be significantly harmed 

table of contents we incorporate software licensed from third parties into the portal solution and any significant interruption in the availability of these third party software products or defects in these products could harm our business portions of the portal solution incorporate software developed and maintained by third party software vendors 
we may incorporate additional software from third party vendors and developers in our future products 
any significant interruption in the availability of these third party software products or defects in these products or future products could harm our sales unless and until we can secure another source 
we may not be able to replace the functionality provided by the third party software currently offered with our products if that software becomes obsolete  defective or incompatible with future versions of our products or is not adequately maintained or updated 
the absence of  or any significant delay in the replacement of that functionality  could result in delayed or lost sales and increased costs and could harm our business 
we are currently a party to securities litigation class action lawsuits and stockholder derivative lawsuits which  if determined adversely  could negatively affect our business and results of operations we are currently a party to a number of securities litigation class action lawsuits and stockholder derivative lawsuits that are described below in part i  item legal proceedings 
these legal proceedings will be expensive to conduct  and if determined adversely to us  could result in our payment of significant damages  which would harm our business and financial condition 
from time to time we may become a party to other threatened legal action including mediation arising from the normal course of business activities 
an unfavorable resolution of theses matters could materially affect our future results of operations or cash flows in a particular period 
in addition  the litigation has been  and may continue to be  time consuming and costly and could divert the attention of our management personnel 
the price of our common stock has been and will continue to be volatile the trading price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and will continue to fluctuate in the future 
for example  the price of our common stock from our initial public offering in may through march  has fluctuated between and per share 
future fluctuation could be a result of a number of factors  many of which are outside our control 
some of these factors include quarter to quarter variations in our operating results  failure to meet the expectations of industry analysts  changes in earnings estimates by us or by analysts  general conditions in the communications and content service industries  announcements and technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors  increased price competition  and developments or disputes concerning intellectual property rights 
in addition  the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations  which have particularly affected the market prices of many internet and computer software companies  including ours  and which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies or our company 
decreases in the trading prices of stocks of technology companies are often precipitous 
for example  the price of our stock dropped rapidly and significantly during the first quarter of fiscal  the fourth quarter of fiscal  the first quarter of fiscal and  most recently  the fourth quarter of fiscal anti takeover provisions in our charter documents  stockholder rights plan and in delaware law could prevent or delay a change in control and  as a result  negatively impact our stockholders we have taken a number of actions that could have the effect of discouraging a takeover attempt 
for example  we have adopted a stockholder rights plan that would cause substantial dilution to a stockholder  and 
table of contents substantially increase the cost paid by a potential acquirer  who attempts to acquire us on terms not approved by our board of directors 
this could prevent us from being acquired or reduce the price paid by any potential acquirer 
in addition  our certificate of incorporation grants the board of directors the authority to fix the rights  preferences and privileges of and issue up to  shares of preferred stock without stockholder action 
although we have no present intention to issue shares of preferred stock  such an issuance could have the effect of making it more difficult and less attractive for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
preferred stock may also have other rights  including economic rights senior to our common stock that could have a material adverse effect on the market value of our common stock 
in addition  the following factors could also delay or prevent a change in control our classified board  certain provisions of our charter  and certain provisions of our bylaws 
in addition  we are subject to the anti takeover provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law 
this section provides that except in certain limited circumstances a corporation shall not engage in any business combination with any interested stockholder during the three year period following the time that such stockholder becomes an interested stockholder 
this provision could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of portal 
financial difficulties of companies we have invested in could adversely affect our financial results we have made investments in several companies and may make investments in others in the future 
if at any time our investment in a company were deemed impaired  we may be required to reduce the book value of that investment  which would in turn reduce our earnings in that period 
such investments could be deemed impaired  for example  if the financial condition of those companies deteriorates 
we have reduced the value of some of these investments previously 
because the financial condition of these companies is outside our control  we cannot predict if  or when  we would be required to reduce the value of such investments 
as of january   we had approximately million total investment of million net of a million write down invested in other companies 
acquisitions of companies or technologies may result in disruptions to our business and management due to difficulties in assimilating personnel and operations we may make acquisitions or investments in other companies  products or technologies 
if we make any acquisitions  we will be required to assimilate the operations  products and personnel of the acquired businesses and train  retain and motivate key personnel from the acquired businesses 
we may be unable to maintain uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies if we fail in these efforts 
similarly  acquisitions may cause disruptions in our operations and divert management s attention from day to day operations  which could impair our relationships with our current employees  customers and strategic partners 
the issuance of equity securities for any acquisition could be substantially dilutive to our stockholders 
in addition  our profitability may suffer because of acquisition related costs or amortization costs for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets 
future regulation of the internet or next generation communication services may slow their growth  resulting in decreased demand for our products and services and increased costs of doing business it is possible that state and federal regulators could adopt laws and regulations that may impose additional burdens on those companies providing communications and content services 
the growth and development of new services may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws or for imposition of additional taxes 
the adoption of any additional laws or regulations affecting communication services may slow their adoption or impose additional burdens on those companies providing such services 
a decline in the growth of next generation communication services could decrease demand for our products and services and increase our cost of doing business  or otherwise harm our business

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about portal s risk management activities includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements for the reasons described under the caption management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risks associated with portal s business and future operating results 
short term investment portfolio we do not hold derivative financial instruments in our short term investment portfolio 
our short term investments consist of instruments rated the equivalent of standard poor s and moody s short term rating a p or long term rating of at least a a this policy dictates that we diversify our holdings and limit our short term investments to a maximum of million to any one issuer 
our policy also dictates that all short term investments mature in months or less 
the following table presents the amounts of cash equivalents and investments that are subject to market risk and the weighted average interest rates  by year of expected maturity for portals investment portfolios 
this table does not include cash because cash is not subject to market risk 
in thousands  except weighted average yields  unaudited 
maturing within year maturing within years thereafter total as of january  cash equivalents weighted average yield investments weighted average yield total portfolio weighted average yield impact of foreign currency rate changes during fiscal  most local currencies of our international subsidiaries strengthened against the us dollar 
because we translate foreign currencies into us dollars for reporting purposes  currency fluctuations can have an impact on our results 
for the fiscal year ended january   we recorded million in foreign exchange gains as a result of remeasuring intercompany transactions from local currencies to u 
s dollar 
to date  we have not engaged in foreign currency hedging 
as a global concern  we anticipate that our sales outside the united states will increasingly be denominated in other currencies 
in such event  we will face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations
