item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
critical accounting policies  estimates and judgements our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accountin g principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the accountin g principles we use require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect th e reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financia l statements and amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period s presented 
we believe in the quality and reasonableness of our critica l accounting policies  however it is likely that materially different amount s would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions tha t we have consistently applied 
we believe our critical accounting policies are a s follows  including our methodology for estimates made and assumptions used 
o revenue recognition policy 
revenues from royalty and finder s agreements are recognized when earned by applying contractua l royalty rates to quarterly point of sale data  among othe r criteria  received from the company s licensees 
the company s royalty recognition policy provides for recognition of royaltie s in the quarter earned  although a large portion of such royalt y payments are actually received during the month following the en d of a quarter 
revenues are not recognized unless collectibilit y is reasonably assured 
o trade receivables 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations o n existing and new customers daily 
we apply reserves fo r delinquent or uncollectible trade receivables based on specifi c identification methodology and also apply a general reserve base d on our trade receivable aging categories 
credit losses have bee n within our estimates over the last few years 
o deferred taxes 
deferred taxes are determined based on th e differences between the financial statement and tax bases o f assets and liabilities  using enacted tax rates in effect for th e year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
valuatio n allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred ta x assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
in assessing th e need for a valuation allowance management considers estimates o f future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible ta x planning strategies 
in accordance with apb opinion  th e company does not accrue income taxes on the undistribute d earnings of a subsidiary which is a disc since the repayment o f the earnings of the disc is not expected in the foreseeabl e future 
if circumstances change and it becomes apparent that som e or all of the undistributed earnings of the disc will be remitte d in the foreseeable future  then taxes will be accrued 
o inventory 
our inventory is valued at the lower of cost o r market 
cost has been derived principally on the standard cos t methodology  where we utilize a first in first out method 
w e provide for reserve allowances on finished goods and specificall y identify and reserve for slow moving or obsolete raw material s and packaging 
o valuation of goodwill  long lived assets and intangible assets the company periodically evaluates goodwill  long lived asset s and intangible assets for potential impairment indicators judgements regarding the existence of impairment indicators ar e based on estimated future cash flows  market conditions  an d legal factors 
future events could cause the company to conclud e that impairment indicators exist and that the net book value o f goodwill  long lived assets and intangible assets is impaired any resulting impairment loss could have a material advers e impact on the company s financial condition and results o f operations 
o contingencies and litigation 
management evaluates contingen t liabilities including threatened or pending litigation i n accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies an d records accruals when the outcome of these matters is deeme d probable and the liability could be reasonably estimated management makes these assessments based on the facts an d circumstances and in some instances based in part on the advic e of outside legal counsel
