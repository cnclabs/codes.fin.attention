table of contents company overview we are the largest health insurance company in the state of new york based on preferred provider organization  or ppo  and health maintenance organization  or hmo  membership 
at december   we served approximately million members through our service areas 
our service areas include downstate new york counties which we refer to as the new york city metropolitan area  where we hold a leading market position covering over of the population  upstate new york and new jersey 
we offer a broad portfolio of managed care and insurance products primarily to private and public employers through a variety of funding arrangements  including insured and self funded  or administrative services only aso 
our managed care product offerings include health maintenance organizations  or hmos  preferred provider organizations  or ppos  exclusive provider organizations  or epos  point of service  or pos  products  and dental only coverage 
we have a broad customer base 
among our customers are large groups of more than employees  which include employees of new york state and new york city as well as labor unions  middle market groups  ranging from to employees  small groups  ranging from two to employees  and individuals 
we also serve approximately million members through our national accounts  generally large  multi state employers  including many fortune companies 
we have the exclusive right to use the blue cross and blue shield names and marks for all of our health benefits products in ten counties in the new york city metropolitan area and in six counties in upstate new york and the non exclusive right to use these names and marks in one upstate new york county 
in addition  we have an exclusive right to use only the blue cross names and marks in seven counties in our upstate new york service area and a nonexclusive right to use only the blue cross names and marks in an additional four upstate new york counties 
our membership in the blue cross blue shield association also enables us to provide our ppo  epo and indemnity members access to the national network of providers through the bluecard program 
this program allows these members access to in network benefits through the networks of blue cross blue shield plans throughout the united states and over foreign countries and territories 
substantially all of our revenues  and nearly all of our membership  is derived from the sale of our blue cross blue shield products and services 
industry overview the managed health care industry has experienced significant change during the past decade 
the increasing focus on health care costs by employers  the government and consumers has led to the growth of alternatives to traditional indemnity health insurance 
hmo  ppo  epo and pos plans are among the various forms of managed care products that have developed in response to these market pressures 
under these arrangements  the cost of health care is contained  in part  by negotiating contracts with hospitals  physicians and other providers to deliver care at favorable rates and adopting programs to ensure that appropriate and cost effective care is provided 
in addition  economic factors and greater consumer awareness have resulted in the increasing popularity of products that offer larger  more extensive networks  more member choice related to coverage and the ability to self refer within those networks 
there is also a growing preference for greater flexibility to assume larger deductibles and co payments in exchange for lower premiums 
at the same time  organizations and individuals are placing an increased focus on the quality of health care and the level of sophistication and customer service in delivering service 
employer groups and providers are also demanding prompt and accurate payment of claims  including automated claims payment options 
there is also a growing preference for national accounts and other large groups to fund their health care costs themselves rather than purchase an insured product 

table of contents the blue cross blue shield association and its member plans also have undergone significant change 
historically  most states had at least one blue cross hospital coverage and a separate blue shield physician coverage company 
prior to the mid s  there were more than separate blue cross and or blue shield companies  which we sometimes refer to as blue plans 
many of these organizations have merged  reducing the number of blue plans to as of december we expect this trend to continue  with plans merging or affiliating to address capital needs and other competitive pressures 
at the same time  the number of people enrolled in blue cross blue shield plans has been steadily increasing  from million in to million at september  nationwide 
the blue cross blue shield plans work together in a number of ways that create significant market advantages  especially when competing for large  multi state employer groups 
for example  all blue cross blue shield plans participate in the bluecard program  which effectively creates a national blue network 
each plan is able to take advantage of other blue cross blue shield plans broad provider networks and negotiated provider reimbursement rates 
utilizing the bluecard program  an indemnity  ppo or epo member of one plan who lives or travels outside of the state in which the policy under which he or she is covered may obtain health care services from a provider that has contracted with the blue cross blue shield plan in the locale in which such member is then situated 
this makes it possible for individual blue cross blue shield plans to compete for national accounts business with other non blue plans with nationwide networks 
our strategy our goal is to be the leading health insurer in the new york marketplace and surrounding areas 
in recent years  we have implemented strategic changes to achieve this goal  including shifting our membership base from purchasers of mainly traditional indemnity products to more innovative managed care products and consolidating our claims payment systems 
we plan to continue to maintain and improve our market position and financial performance by executing the following strategy capitalize on growth opportunities 
offer a broad spectrum of managed care products in our local markets 
we intend to continue to grow our business in our local markets  particularly in the small group and middle market customer segment  by maintaining  developing and offering the broad continuum of managed care products that the new york market demands 
generally  the breadth and flexibility of our benefit plan options are designed to appeal to a variety of employer groups and individuals with differing product and service preferences 
we believe that customer needs will continue to change  requiring us to increase the variety of products we offer 
product variations will include freedom in selecting providers  cost sharing  scope of coverage and the degree of medical management 
for example  during  we launched a pos product to employer groups  primarily focused on small and middle market customers 
grow our national accounts business 
we view national accounts as an attractive growth opportunity  as this group represents approximately of employed persons in the united states 
we believe our position in the new york city metropolitan area  where a significant number of national businesses have headquarters  provides us with a competitive advantage in our efforts to grow this business 
in addition  we intend to continue to grow our national accounts business through the promotion of the bluecard program 
expand geographically 
we also intend to pursue expansion opportunities  especially those in or adjacent to our current service areas 
we believe that we have developed an expertise in systems migration  network development  marketing  underwriting and cost control that is transferable to attractive markets within and outside new york and which positions us to take advantage of opportunities that may arise as the consolidation of the health insurance industry continues 
leverage the strength of the blue cross and blue shield brands 
we believe that our license to use the blue cross and blue shield names and marks gives us a significant competitive advantage in new york  and we intend to continue to promote the value of these brands to attract additional customers and members 

table of contents continue to promote the use of medical information to offer innovative products and services to members and providers 
we intend to be a leader in the use of medical information to facilitate and enhance communications and delivery of service among employers  employees and other health care providers 
we believe that our members will increasingly desire and demand ready access to a repository of comprehensive  accurate and secure medical and health related information that can be transmitted by the member to physicians and medical institutions 
reduce costs through operational excellence 
we are seeking to achieve operational excellence by improving delivery of service  customer satisfaction and financial results through high levels of performance accompanied by cost containment 
our new york regional markets new york is the third most populous state in the united states  with a total population of approximately million  according to the most recent us census estimates 
we believe we can increase our market share through focused marketing efforts on a cost effective basis  given the high population density in selected markets such as the new york city metropolitan area 
the new york marketplace is comprised of a diverse customer base requiring a broad range of product offerings  and we believe our extensive experience and history of operating in this unique marketplace combined with our leading market share and brand recognition provides us with a distinct competitive advantage 
we operate in counties in eastern new york  including the ten counties in the new york city metropolitan area  and counties in new jersey 
in our new york service area  we provide our products and services utilizing one or both of the blue cross blue shield brands through our indirect  wholly owned subsidiaries  empire healthchoice assurance  or empire  a new york licensed accident and health insurer  and empire healthchoice hmo  a new york licensed hmo 
we utilize these brands to market to local groups and individuals in our new york service area as well as to national account customers 
as of december   approximately of our members were covered under national accounts 
the national accounts are generally self funded accounts to which we provide our products on an aso basis with their employees having access to a nationwide network of providers through the bluecard program 
our new jersey operations are operated under the wellchoice brand comprised of wellchoice insurance of new jersey and empire healthchoice hmo d b a wellchoice hmo of new jersey  which engages in managed care business in new jersey 
our new jersey operations were launched in and offer a comprehensive network of providers across northern  central new jersey and the southern new jersey counties of burlington  camden and ocean

health care benefits  products and services we offer a wide range of health insurance products 
our offerings include managed care products consisting of hmo  pos  ppo and epo plans and traditional indemnity products 
our principal health products are offered both on an insured and  except with respect to our hmo products  self funded  or aso basis and  in some instances  a combination of insured and self funded

revenues from external customers  investment income and realized gains  other revenue and income from continuing operations before income tax expense attributable to each of our reportable segments are set forth in note to the consolidated financial statements  which are included elsewhere in this report 
assets are not allocated to the segments 
we do not have intersegment sales or expenses 
commercial managed care products managed care generally refers to a method of integrating the financing and delivery of health care within a system that manages the cost  accessibility and quality of care 
managed care products can be further differentiated by the types of provider networks offered  the ability to use providers outside such networks and the scope of the medical management and quality assurance programs 
our members receive medical care from our networks of providers in exchange for premiums paid by the individuals or their employers and  in some instances  a co payment by the member 
we reimburse network providers according to pre established fee arrangements and other contractual agreements 
we currently offer the following managed care plans an hmo product  a ppo product  an epo product and a pos product 
hmo 
our hmo plan provides members and their dependent family members with all necessary health care for a fixed monthly premium in addition to applicable member co payments 
health care services can include emergency care  inpatient hospital and physician care  outpatient medical services and supplemental services  such as dental  behavioral health and prescription drugs 
under our standard hmo product  members must select a primary care physician within the network to provide and assist in managing care  including referrals to specialists 
we also offer a direct connection hmo product  which offers all the advantages of our standard hmo product  but allows our eligible members to seek care from in network specialists without a referral 
hmo members do not have access to services on a national account basis through the bluecard program 
we also provide services to medicare beneficiaries through our medicare choice product  which covers all medicare covered services  medicare deductibles and coinsurance and certain additional services 
hmo members receive all covered medical care through physicians selected from the applicable hmo provider network 
ppo 
similar to an hmo  a ppo managed care plan provides members and their dependent family members with health care coverage in exchange for a fixed monthly premium 
our ppo provides its members with access to a larger network of providers than our hmo 
a ppo does not require a member to select a primary care 
table of contents physician or to obtain a referral to utilize in network specialists 
in contrast to an hmo product  a ppo also provides coverage for members who access providers outside of the network 
out of network benefits are usually subject to a deductible and coinsurance 
our ppo also offers national in network coverage to its members through the bluecard program 
for our new york state and new york city accounts we provide a hospital only network ppo benefit 
epo 
our epo plan is similar to our ppo managed care plan but does not cover out of network care 
members may choose any provider from our ppo network in our new york service area and do not need to select a primary care physician 
outside of our service area in new york state  epo members may use the bluecard program to secure in network benefits nationally 
we currently offer an epo product only to new york state employers and to national accounts on a self funded basis 
for national accounts needing coverage in jurisdictions where the epo product is prohibited  we offer a variation of this product that requires a coinsurance payment for out of network services 
pos 
consistent with our strategy to offer a broad continuum of managed care products in the new york market  we have recently introduced a point of service  or pos  product to employer groups  focused primarily on local small and middle market customers 
the product  direct pos  provides members with the ability to utilize services on an in network basis utilizing our hmo network of providers or on an out of network basis 
pos members do not have access to services on a national account basis through the bluecard program 
our pos product has similar features to our direct hmo product that permits members to access in network specialists without a referral  and also allows members to access out of network providers in return for deductibles and or co insurance 
we believe the pos product will complement our existing managed care product portfolio by offering employers an additional product within our family of managed care products to meet the needs of their employees 
in addition  we offer dental coverage on a ppo basis and other dental managed care products 
bluecard for our members who purchase our ppo  epo and indemnity products under a blue cross blue shield plan  we offer the bluecard program 
the bluecard program offers these members in network benefits through the networks of the other blue cross blue shield plans in other states and regions 
in addition  the bluecard program offers our ppo  epo and indemnity members in network coverage in over countries and territories 
we believe that the national and international coverage provided through this program allows us to compete effectively with large national insurers  without compromising our focus and concentration in our geographical region 
we derive administrative fees from other blue cross blue shield plans when their members receive medical care from providers in our service areas 
in  approximately  members of other blue cross blue shield plans utilized our provider networks through the bluecard programs 
we also pay other blue cross blue shield plans administrative fees when our members receive medical care from providers in those other plans service areas 
other insurance products and services we provide indemnity health insurance  which generally reimburses the insured for a percentage of actual costs of health care services rendered by physicians  hospitals and other providers 
persons with indemnity insurance are not restricted to receiving professional medical services from a specified provider network 
our indemnity products include hospital only coverage as well as comprehensive hospital and medical coverage 
we also offer a number of individual products  including child health plus  medicare supplemental  healthy new york whether purchased by groups or by individuals  direct pay hospital only and the new york state mandated  direct pay hmo and hmo based pos products 
child health plus provides a managed care product similar to our hmo products to children under the age of nineteen who are ineligible for medicaid and 
table of contents not otherwise insured 
our medicare supplemental insurance policies  also referred to as medigap policies  are designed to supplement medicare by paying hospital  medical and surgical expenses as well as  in some cases  prescription drug expenses for a portion of those costs not covered by medicare 
direct pay hospital only is a low cost policy that covers primarily inpatient services on an indemnity basis and healthy new york is a state mandated hmo product 
we also serve as fiscal intermediary for the medicare part a program and a carrier for the medicare part b program  for which we receive reimbursement of certain costs and expenses at predetermined levels 
administrative services only in addition to our insured plans  we also offer selected products  including ppo  epo and indemnity benefit designs  on a self funded  or aso  basis under which we provide claims processing and other administrative services to employers 
employers choosing to purchase our products on an aso basis fund their own claims but their employees are able to access our provider network at our negotiated discounted rates 
we administer the payment of claims to the providers but we do not bear any insurance risk in connection with claims costs because we are reimbursed in full by the employer 
the administrative fee charged to self funded groups is generally based on the size of the group and services provided 
our primary aso customers are large national accounts and large local groups over  employees 
marketing and distribution our marketing activities concentrate on promoting our strong brands  quality care  customer service efforts  the size and quality of our provider networks  our financial strength and the breadth of our product offerings 
we distribute our products through several different channels  including our salaried and commission based internal sales force  independent brokers and telemarketing staff 
we also use our website to market our products 
branding and marketing 
our branding and marketing efforts include brand advertising  which focuses on the blue cross and blue shield names and marks  acquisition marketing  which focuses on attracting new customers  and institutional advertising  which focuses on our overall corporate image 
we believe that the strongest element of our brand identity is the blue cross and blue shield 
we seek to leverage what we believe to be the high name recognition and comfort level that many existing and potential customers associate with this brand 
also  the bluecard program is an important component of our blue cross blue shield marketing strategy as it enables us to compete for large  multi state employer groups 
acquisition marketing consists of business to business marketing efforts which are used to generate leads for brokers and our sales force as well as direct to consumer marketing which is used to add new customers to our direct pay businesses 
institutional advertising is used to promote key corporate interests and overall company image 
we believe these efforts support and further our competitive brand advantage 
our strategy will be to continue utilizing the blue cross and or blue shield brands for all products and services in our service areas in new york and to continue to establish the wellchoice brand outside of new york 
distribution 
as of january   our sales force consisted of over people 
we also utilize the services of approximately  independent brokers in new york and approximately  in new jersey 
we rely on independent brokers to market our products to small and middle market groups 
in addition  we engage general agents to distribute our products in new jersey  as well as seven general agents to distribute our products to middle market and large groups in new york 
several account representatives and managers are dedicated exclusively to maintaining our relationships with our national accounts and labor union customers 
our internal telemarketing division is primarily responsible for marketing our managed health care plans to small groups 
our sales staff is primarily responsible for marketing our managed health care plans to small and large groups  either directly or working with a broker 
we believe that each of these marketing methods is optimally suited to address the specific health insurance needs of the customer base to which it is assigned 

table of contents we compete for qualified brokers and agents to distribute our products 
strong competition exists among health insurance companies and health benefits plans for brokers and agents with demonstrated ability to secure new business and maintain existing accounts 
the basis of competition for the services of such brokers and agents are commission structure  support services  reputation and prior relationships  the ability to retain clients and the quality of products 
we believe that our brokers gain significant benefits from our dedicated broker website  which enables them to obtain quotes for our small group products and perform administrative services for existing accounts 
we believe that we have good relationships with our brokers and agents  and that our products  support services and commission structure are highly competitive in the marketplace 
customers the following chart shows our membership by customer group at december  membership percentage in thousands large group small group and middle market individuals national accounts total we sell products to customers ranging in size from large national institutional accounts to individuals 
we continually seek to obtain an optimal and balanced portfolio of business across all of our customer segments 
large groups 
this customer base consists of large organizations with operations in our service areas that have more than employees and includes new york state  new york city and local governmental employers and labor unions 
our large corporate accounts purchase our products on both an insured and aso basis 
we sell our products to new york state and new york city in their capacity as employers 
as of december   our new york state and new york city accounts covered approximately and  respectively  of our total membership  and labor unions represented of our total membership 
we provide hospital only coverage to both the new york state and new york city accounts 
the pricing of our products provided to new york state and new york city has historically been renegotiated annually 
effective january   we agreed to new pricing with new york state covering a three year period through december   though both parties retain the right to terminate the contract on six months notice 
for more than two years  the new york city account has been subject to a competitive bid process in which we have participated  relating to a five year contract 
in october  we agreed to new rates with the new york city account for the period from july  through june  we expect the new york city account to complete the competitive bid process for the five year contract some time in the first half of the loss of one or both of the new york city and new york state accounts would result in reduced membership and revenue and require us to reduce  reallocate or absorb administrative expenses associated with these accounts 
small group and middle market 
this customer base consists of small two to employees and mid sized to employees companies 
our small groups have tended to purchase hmo products  while our middle market groups are covered by a mix of our hmo  ppo and epo products and by other products  including pos 
we intend to continue to grow our small group and middle market customer base 
to that end  in  we introduced a pos product for this market 
the product  which utilizes our hmo network of providers  offers members the ability to utilize services on an in or out of network basis 
in network specialists may be accessed without a referral while members may access out of network providers in return for deductibles and or co insurance 
individuals 
this customer base consists principally of members who utilize our government related products including child health plus  medicare supplemental  medicare choice  healthy new york and two new york state mandated direct pay hmo and hmo based point of service products 

table of contents national accounts 
national accounts consist of large multi state employers for whom technology  flexibility  access to the bluecard program and single point accountability are important factors 
national accounts often engage consultants to work with our in house sales staff to tailor benefits to their needs 
substantially all of our national accounts purchase our products on an aso basis 
in order to provide aso services and access to the bluecard program to customers that are headquartered outside of our licensed areas  we are required under our blue cross and blue shield licenses to obtain the consent of the blue cross blue shield plan licensed in the service area in which the customer is headquartered  a process referred to as ceding 
underwriting and pricing disciplined underwriting and appropriate pricing are core strengths of our business and we believe are an important competitive advantage 
we continually review our underwriting and pricing guidelines on a product by product and customer group by group basis in order to maintain competitive rates in terms of both price and scope of benefits 
as a result of our disciplined approach to underwriting and pricing  we have attained consistent profitability in our insured book of business 
our claims database enables us to establish rates based on our own experience and provides us with important insights about the risks in our service areas 
we tightly manage the overall rating process and have processes in place to ensure that underwriting decisions are made by properly qualified personnel 
in addition  we have developed and implemented a process to detect fraudulent groups  employees and providers 
our rating policies in new york differ by group size product offerings 
our middle market and large group accounts for epo  ppo and indemnity products are experience rated 
this means that our premium rate for each of these accounts is calculated based upon demographic criteria such as age  gender  industry and region and experience criteria  referring to the actual cost of providing health care to that group during a period of coverage 
for middle market groups  the rates are set prospectively 
this means that we are at risk for negative experience actual claim costs and other expenses are more than those expected and benefit from positive experience claim costs and other expenses are less than expected 
for large groups with ppo  epo or traditional indemnity benefit designs  we employ prospective and retrospective ratings 
our new york city and new york state accounts are retrospectively rated 
in retrospective rating  a premium rate is determined at the beginning of the policy period 
once the policy period has ended  the actual experience is reviewed 
if the experience is positive  a refund is credited to the customer 
if the experience is negative  then the deficit is recovered from future years premiums 
if the customer elects to terminate coverage  deficits cannot be recovered 
our hmo products sold in new york state  as well as all other insured products purchased by small groups and individuals  are community rated 
the premiums for community rated products are set according to our expected costs of providing medical benefits to the community pool as a whole  rather than to any customer or sub group of customers within the community 
we cannot factor in other criteria in rating our premiums for these products  other than medicare eligibility 
we use a variation of community rating in new jersey for all small group products 
all of our community rated products in new jersey are determined based on a community pool according to the age  sex and county of residence of the members 
both the new york and new jersey community rated products are set prospectively  meaning that a fixed premium rate is determined at the beginning of the policy period 
unanticipated increases in cost of benefits provided may not be able to be recovered in that current policy year 
however  prior experience  in the aggregate  is considered in determining premium rates for future periods 
with respect to our medicare choice plan  we have a contract with the centers for medicare and medicaid services  or cms  to provide hmo medicare choice coverage to medicare beneficiaries who choose health care coverage through our hmo program in new york city and nassau  suffolk  rockland and westchester counties in new york state 
under this annual contract  cms pays us a set rate based on membership that is adjusted for demographic factors 
in addition  through  the medicare product offered by us in nassau  suffolk  rockland 
table of contents and westchester counties required a supplemental premium to be paid by the member 
at december   we had approximately  members enrolled in medicare choice  or of our commercial managed care membership 
medicare choice accounted for of our commercial managed care premium revenue for the year ended december  effective january   in addition to benefit changes to our existing medicare choice product  we have introduced an alternative benefit plan in new york city to respond to market demands that eliminates or decreases certain copayments and eliminates brand name prescription drug coverage 
based upon the higher level of payments we expect to receive from cms as a result of the recently enacted medicare prescription improvement and modernization act  subject to cms approval  we will eliminate the additional premiums required by members of our medicare choice program in rockland and westchester counties  reduce the additional premium required by members in nassau and suffolk counties and increase benefits available to new york city members 
quality initiatives and medical management our approach to quality initiatives and medical management seeks to ensure that high quality care is provided to our members 
for purposes of our quality programs  we segment our membership into four health categories healthy  acute  chronic and complex and allocate our resources to facilitate the delivery of quality health care appropriate for each segment 
our quality initiatives and medical management approach seeks to improve member health  to avoid health risks and to lower costs 
we use sophisticated healthcare information technologies to identify those members who incur a disproportionate amount of health care costs for treatment and hospitalization 
we use this information to work with physicians to develop appropriate programs intended to improve member health and thereby minimize future claims expenditures 
a small portion of our insured commercial managed care members who have both medical and hospital coverage constitute a significant majority of our hospital and medical claims expenses 
we are focusing on controlling these costs by using innovative technology  including sophisticated databases that can identify and monitor specific members who have the potential for high costs of benefits provided 
our programs are built upon nationally recognized guidelines 
we use statistical modeling techniques as well as data generated through our claims system to help identify members in high risk populations 
in addition  our sara initiative  which is offered to our aso accounts and some insured groups and provided to hmo members who are at least years of age  serves as an early intervention program with a goal of identifying potential issues in physician recommended treatments 
the sara program uses our claims system to generate and analyze medical  laboratory  pharmacy and hospital claims data with the goal of identifying patients at risk of potentially serious medical conditions and alerting physicians of identified risks  such as adverse drug reactions  skipped preventive screenings and overlooked tests 
these members are also alerted on line in the secure site in their sara messaging center 
in addition  we have developed and provide a variety of services and programs for the acute  chronic and complex populations as well as on line and off line educational materials to help keep members healthy 
the services and programs seek to enhance quality by eliminating inappropriate hospitalizations or services and eliminating possible complications of procedures performed in hospitals 
these services and programs include pre certification and concurrent review hospital discharge services for acute patients  as well as disease management programs for the chronic care population and nurse case managers for complex population members 
effective october  we have consolidated and broadened our disease management programs by contracting with american healthways  inc to provide comprehensive disease management services to members with chronic conditions  including the following core conditions asthma  diabetes  congestive heart failure  coronary artery disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
some or all of the disease management programs for the core conditions outsourced to american healthways will be included in our insured products while those and others will be offered to self funded groups 
we also have arrangements with two other disease management companies to provide specialized support services for members with other chronic care conditions  such as parkinson s disease  multiple sclerosis  lupus and kidney failure 

table of contents we have created a pilot program in support of patient safety  in conjunction with ibm  pepsico  inc  verizon communications  inc 
and xerox corporation four of our national accounts 
using what are known as leapfrog group standards  this program aims to improve patient safety in hospitals by giving consumers information to make more informed hospital choices 
the leapfrog group is sponsored by the business roundtable  a national association of fortune companies 
the goals of our pilot program are to provide a web based tool that allows easy access and review of the leapfrog patient safety data  on a hospital by hospital basis  for our employees and for employees of our key customers participating in the pilot 
we also encourage the prescription of formulary and generic drugs  instead of non formulary equivalent drugs  through member and physician interactions 
in addition  through arrangements with our pharmacy benefit manager  advancepcs  we are able to obtain discounts and rebates on certain medications through bulk purchasing 
we have integrated medical policies  which we derive from cms and commercial and industry standard sources  into our claims processing systems 
this integration substantially enhances the quality and accuracy of our claims adjudication process 
information systems and telecommunications infrastructure the development and enhancement of our information technology systems and integrated voice and data capabilities has been  and continues to be  a key component of our strategy of operational excellence 
we have spent significant time and resources enhancing the capabilities of our customer service systems 
we have consolidated multiple claims systems into two platforms and are in the process of migrating our national accounts claims  which have been processed by national accounts service company  llc  or nasco  a related party  into our other claims platform 
in addition  we have implemented innovative voice and data technologies that link most of our office locations  allowing us to broadcast and communicate in real time to our employees desktops 
these initiatives and innovations have allowed us to increase our first pass rate for physician claims from in to in the second half of and  for hospital claims  from in to in the second half of  enable physicians to submit claims via the internet and to receive claim payment determinations in real time  and improve the timeliness and ease of financial and other reporting 
we believe that our success in enhancing and consolidating our information systems provides us with a distinct competitive advantage that will allow us to grow our business organically as well as through potential strategic acquisitions 
we believe our experience in this area will allow the integration of other information technologies and processes into our own in a timely and efficient manner 
collaborations in addition to developing technological and managerial capabilities internally  we also collaborate with third parties to develop new systems  technologies and capabilities 
these collaborations allow us to leverage the core strengths of third parties to create better quality of service for our customers as well as to increase efficiencies of our internal systems and processes 
we are currently involved in a major collaboration with the goal of substantially enhancing our technological capabilities and cost efficiencies 
ibm 
through a technology alliance with ibm  we plan to continue to enhance our information systems and processes as well as to transition our technology systems to new state of the art platforms and technologies 
a key component of our agreement with ibm is to acquire or develop new systems  which are built on open architectures 
open architectures employ a common set of business rules  programming codes and processes which are developed using the same standards so that new functionality can be quickly and efficiently built or integrated 

table of contents the ibm agreement became effective in june and is for a term of ten years 
under the agreement  ibm is responsible for operating our data center  a portion of our core applications development and technical help desk 
in connection with these services  ibm has sublet our data center facility in staten island  new york 
in order to maintain the continuity  consistency and quality of our operations after these operations have transitioned to ibm  the agreement includes mutually developed performance  quality and pricing benchmarks that must be maintained by ibm 
we also have the flexibility to adjust our requirements to respond to dynamic shifts in the industry  such as reductions in membership for a particular product  customary advances in technology or improvements in the methods of delivering services which modify  reduce or eliminate our need for a particular service from ibm  or a substantial increase or reduction in our actual usage of a resource provided under the agreement 
pursuant to the ibm agreement  we will work jointly with ibm to enhance and modernize our systems applications 
some of the systems application software development will be done overseas from ibm s offices in bangalore  india or  in the event this facility becomes unavailable during the life of the agreement  services will be provided from a replacement facility 
these applications include technological enhancements based on the ongoing requirements of our business and solutions developed based upon our specifications

the new claims payment system will be licensed to us when it is completed 
the development of the system has been delayed by denovis and as a result we do not expect the system to be ready for acceptance by us in accordance with its specifications any earlier than the second half of an approximate two year delay from the original july date we had agreed upon with ibm in june we do not believe this delay will have any material impact on our operations because our existing claims payment system is adequate to meet our needs

aware dental 
we have outsourced much of the management of our dental products to aware dental services  llc of minnesota 
aware dental services  a joint venture between de care international and blue cross and blue shield of minnesota  provides dental development  management and administrative services in connection with dentist networks 
under this arrangement  aware dental is responsible for customer service  underwriting and pricing  provider contracting  claims processing and utilization management 
we retain responsibility for membership and billing services  and we share joint responsibility with respect to the marketing and sales of our products  information technology  product development and design and regulatory filings 
provider arrangements we have the largest hmo and ppo provider networks of any health insurer or hmo in our new york service area 
our relationships with health care providers  physicians  hospitals  other facilities and ancillary health care providers are guided by state and national standards established by regulatory authorities for network development  service availability and contract methodologies 
in contrast to some health benefits companies  it is generally our philosophy not to delegate full financial responsibility for health services provided to our members to our providers in the form of capitation based reimbursement 
as a result  the vast majority of our providers are reimbursed on a discounted fee for service basis 
under these contracts  we aim to provide market based reimbursement consistent with industry and market 
table of contents standards 
we seek to ensure that providers in our networks are paid in a timely manner 
we seek to maintain broad provider networks to ensure member choice while implementing effective management programs designed to improve the quality of care received by our members 
for some ancillary services  such as behavioral health services  we have entered into capitation arrangements with entities that offer broad based services through their own contracts with providers 
to build our provider networks  we compete with other health benefits plans for contracts with hospitals  physicians and other providers 
we believe that physicians and other providers primarily consider member volume  reimbursement rates  timeliness of reimbursement and administrative service capabilities when deciding whether to contract with a health benefits plan 
hospitals 
we contract with our hospitals to reimburse them for services provided to our members on both a per diem and case rate basis and have recently seen a trend toward case rate reimbursement 
in contrast to per diem rates  case rate reimbursement provides for the payment of a fixed fee to cover all hospital services required to treat a particular condition or episode of illness 
we have multi year reimbursement arrangements with over of the hospitals in our new york network 
these agreements are subject to early termination pursuant to notice periods generally ranging from to days 
the hospital industry in new york is well organized  with a significant amount of bargaining power 
our responsive reimbursement methodology  revised cost and utilization management review process and our open channels of communication are key components of our relationship and credibility with hospitals 
physicians 
fee for service is our predominant reimbursement methodology for physicians 
our physician rate schedules applicable to services provided by in network physicians are pegged to a resource based relative value system fee schedule and then adjusted for competitive pressures in the market 
this structure is similar to physician reimbursement methodologies developed and used by the federal medicare system and other major payers 
with respect to blue cross and blue shield branded products in our new york service areas and counties that are contiguous to these areas  services are provided to our members through our network providers with whom we contract directly 
members seeking medical treatment outside of these areas are provided through the networks of the local blue cross and or blue shield plan operating in that area through the bluecard program 
with respect to our new jersey operations  we contract directly with physicians in our new jersey service area and provide members outside of new jersey with coverage through a third party national provider network 
provider portals 
we utilize technology to deliver useful and practical information and services to our providers 
through the use of our physician portal  which we introduced in  our network practitioners are now able to submit their claims via the internet and receive claim payment determinations in real time 
in  we introduced a hospital portal to our network hospitals enabling them to perform a variety of functions  including claim management  member eligibility and benefit confirmations on line 
subcontracting 
we subcontract for behavioral healthcare and pharmacy services through contracts with third parties 
behavioral health benefits are provided through magellan behavioral health  inc under a capitation based contract which expires december  under the agreement  magellan arranges services through its network of behavioral health care providers 
its care managers focus on access to appropriate providers and settings for behavioral health care services 
our contract with magellan is multi year and capitation based 
in addition  we have a five year agreement with advancepcs expiring december   pursuant to which advancepcs provides pharmacy benefit management services to our members 
these services include member services  retail pharmacy network contracting and management  claims processing  payment of claims to participating pharmacies and drug rebate negotiations with manufacturers 
we retain primary responsibility for formulary management and compliance  utilization management and pharmacy clinical policies and programs 

table of contents in addition  we have contracts with a number of other ancillary service providers  including laboratory service providers  home health agency providers and intermediate and long term care providers  to provide access to a wide range of services 
these providers are normally paid on either a fee schedule  fixed per day or per case basis 
competition the health insurance industry is highly competitive  both nationally and in new york and new jersey 
competition has intensified in recent years due to more aggressive marketing and pricing  a proliferation of new products and increased quality awareness and price sensitivity among customers 
industry participants compete for customers based on the ability to provide value which we believe includes quality of service and flexibility of benefit designs  access to and quality of provider networks  brand recognition and reputation  price and financial stability 
we believe that our competitive strengths  including the size and quality of our provider network  the broad range of our product offerings and our blue cross blue shield license position us well to satisfy these competitive requirements 
competitors in our markets include national health benefits companies and local and regional for profit and not for profit health insurance and managed care plans 
our markets for managed care products are generally more competitive than our markets for other products  including indemnity products 
our largest competitors in the new york city metropolitan area include national health benefits companies  such as unitedhealthcare  aetna and healthnet  and regional local health insurers  such as oxford health plans  health insurance plan of greater new york  which we refer to as hip  and group health incorporated or ghi 
we compete in upstate new york with other blue plans  including healthnow new york inc  as well as other non blue plans  such as capital district physicians health plan and mvp health plan 
our major competitors for national accounts customers include unitedhealthcare  cigna and aetna as well as other blue plans 
in new jersey  we compete with several national health benefits companies and horizon blue cross blue shield 
blue cross blue shield license we have the exclusive right to use the blue cross and blue shield names and marks for all of our health benefits products in all ten counties in the new york city metropolitan area and in six counties in upstate new york and a non exclusive right to use those names and marks in one upstate new york county 
in addition  we have an exclusive right to use only the blue cross names and marks in seven counties in our upstate new york service area and a non exclusive right to use only the blue cross names and marks in an additional four counties in upstate new york 
we refer to these counties in new york as our blue cross blue shield licensed territory 
we do not have any rights to use the blue cross and or blue shield names and marks in new jersey or elsewhere to market our products and services 
we believe that the blue cross and blue shield names and marks are valuable identifiers of our products and services in the marketplace 
the license agreements  which have a perpetual term but which are subject to termination under circumstances described below  contain reserve requirements  discussed below under government regulation capital and reserve requirements  and other requirements and restrictions regarding our operations and our use of the blue cross and blue shield names and marks 
upon the occurrence of any event causing termination of the license agreements  we would cease to have the right to use the blue cross and blue shield names and marks in the blue cross blue shield licensed territory 
we also would no longer have access to the blue cross blue shield association networks of providers and bluecard program 
we would expect to lose a significant portion of our membership if we lose these licenses 
loss of these licenses could significantly harm our ability to compete in our markets and could require payment of significant monetary penalties to the blue cross blue shield association 
furthermore  the blue cross blue 
table of contents shield association would be free to issue a license to use the blue cross and blue shield names and marks in the counties in new york in which we had previously used the blue cross and or blue shield name and mark to another entity  which would have a material adverse affect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
events which could result in termination of our license agreements include failure to maintain our total adjusted capital at of authorized control level risk based capital  as defined by the naic risk based capital rbc model act  failure to maintain liquidity of greater than one month of underwritten claims and administrative expenses  as defined by the blue cross blue shield association  for two consecutive quarters  failure to satisfy state mandated statutory net worth requirements  impending financial insolvency  and a change of control not otherwise approved by the blue cross blue shield association or a violation of the blue cross blue shield association ownership limitations on our capital stock 
the blue cross blue shield association license agreements and membership standards specifically permit a licensee to operate as a for profit  publicly traded stock company  subject to governance and ownership requirements 
pursuant to the rules and license standards of the blue cross blue shield association  we guarantee our contractual and financial obligations to respective customers 
in addition  pursuant to the rules and license standards of the blue cross blue shield association  we have agreed to indemnify the blue cross blue shield association against any claims asserted against it resulting from our contractual and financial obligations 
each license requires an annual fee to be paid to the blue cross blue shield association 
the fee is determined based on premiums earned from products using the blue cross and blue shield names and marks and from a per contract charge for self funded membership 
during   and  we paid fees to the blue cross blue shield association in the amount of million  million  and million  respectively 
the blue cross blue shield association is a national trade association of blue cross blue shield licensees  the primary function of which is to promote and preserve the integrity of the blue cross blue shield names and marks  as well as to provide certain coordination among the member plans 
each blue cross blue shield licensee is an independent legal organization and is not responsible for obligations of other blue cross blue shield association member organizations 
subject to the ceding rules discussed below  we have no right to market products and services using the blue cross blue shield names and marks outside our blue cross blue shield licensed territory 
ceding 
the rules and license standards of the blue cross blue shield association set forth procedures with respect to the provision of insurance or administrative services to national accounts with employees located in numerous jurisdictions 
blue cross blue shield licensees may offer products on an aso basis to accounts with headquarters located outside of their licensed areas  provided the other blue plan with a service area in which the customer is headquartered cedes its right to the selling blue cross blue shield licensee 
the duration of the ceding arrangement is determined by the two plans 
at december   approximately  members of our total national account membership  or approximately of overall membership  was attributable to aso business ceded by other plans to us 
most of these ceding arrangements have a three year term and are subject to renewal 
bluecard 
under the rules and license standards of the blue cross blue shield association  other blue plans must provide health care to members through the bluecard program in a manner and scope as consistent as possible to what such member would be entitled to in his or her home region 
the blue cross blue shield association requires us to pay administrative fees to any host blue plan that provides these claims and other 
table of contents services to our members who receive care in their service area 
similarly  we are paid administrative fees for providing claims and other services to members of other blue cross blue shield plans who receive care in our service area 
claim reserves medical benefits for claims occurring during any accounting period are paid upon receipt of claim and adjudication 
we are required to estimate the ultimate amount of claims which have not been reported  or which have been received but not yet adjudicated  during any accounting period 
these estimates  referred to as claim reserves  are recorded as liabilities on our balance sheet 
we estimate claim reserves in accordance with actuarial standards of practice promulgated by the actuarial standards board  the committee of the american academy of actuaries that establishes the professional guidelines and standards for actuaries to follow 
a degree of judgment is involved in estimating reserves 
we make assumptions regarding the propriety of using existing claims data as the basis for projecting future payments 
factors we consider include medical cost trends  the mix of products and benefits sold  internal processing changes and the amount of time it took to pay all of the benefits for claims from prior periods 
differences between actual experience and the assumptions made in establishing the claim reserves may lead to actual costs of benefits provided to be greater or less than the estimated costs of benefits provided 
the change in the claim reserve estimate during the accounting period is reported as a change in medical expense 
employees at january   we employed approximately  employees in our offices in new york city  albany  middletown  yorktown heights  melville  syracuse and bohemia  new york  as well as harrisburg  pennsylvania  and several other smaller locations 
approximately  of our employees are engaged in administration of our contracts with cms  under which we act as a fiscal intermediary for the medicare part a program and a carrier for the medicare part b program 
twenty six employees in our internal sales division are subject to a collective bargaining agreement with the office and professional employees international union 
no other employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements 
overall  we believe that our relations with our employees are good  and we have not experienced any work stoppages 
government regulation the business operations of our subsidiary health insurance companies and health maintenance organizations are subject to comprehensive and detailed state regulation in new york and new jersey  as well as federal regulation 
supervisory agencies  including state health and insurance departments and  in some instances  the state attorney general  have broad authority to grant  suspend and revoke licenses to transact business  regulate many aspects of the products and services we offer  assess fines  penalties and or sanctions  monitor our solvency and adequacy of our financial reserves  and regulate our investment activities on the basis of quality  diversification and other quantitative criteria  within the parameters of a list of permitted investments set forth in applicable insurance laws and regulations 
our operations and accounts are subject to examination at regular intervals by these agencies 
in addition  the federal and state governments continue to consider and enact many legislative and regulatory proposals that have impacted  or would materially impact  various aspects of the health care system 
many of these changes are described below 
while certain of these measures could adversely affect us  at this time we cannot predict the extent of this impact 

table of contents the federal government and the governments of the states in which we conduct our health care operations have adopted laws and regulations that govern our business activities in various ways 
these laws and regulations may restrict how we conduct our business and may result in additional burdens and costs to us 
areas of governmental regulation include licensure  policy forms  including plan design and disclosures  premium rates and rating methodologies  underwriting rules and procedures  benefit mandates  eligibility requirements  geographic service areas  market conduct  utilization review  payment of claims  including timeliness and accuracy of payment  special rules in contracts to administer government programs  transactions with affiliated entities  limitations on the ability to pay dividends  transactions resulting in a change of control  member rights and responsibilities  sales and marketing activities  quality assurance procedures  privacy of medical and other information and permitted disclosures  rates of payment to providers of care  surcharges on payments to providers  provider contract forms  delegation of financial risk and other financial arrangements in rates paid to providers of care  agent licensing  financial condition including reserves  corporate governance  and permissible investments 
these laws and regulations are subject to amendments and changing interpretations in each jurisdiction 
failure to comply with existing or future laws and regulations could materially and adversely affect our operations  financial condition and prospects 
the company is also subject to federal and state laws  rules and regulations generally applicable to public corporations  including  but not limited to  those governed by the commission  the internal revenue service and state corporate and taxation departments 
the company is also subject to the listing standards of the new york

underwriting and rating limitations 
health insurers in new york  and health insurers and hmos in new jersey  are required to offer coverage on a community rated  open enrollment basis to all small groups seeking coverage and may not utilize medical underwriting 
hmos in new york are also required to offer coverage on a community rated  open enrollment basis to essentially all groups seeking coverage and may not utilize medical underwriting 
none of these may decline to accept individuals within a group based on health related factors 
all hmos operating in new york are required to make coverage available to individuals on a non group basis  without underwriting and on a community rated basis  through two standard policies with broad  comprehensive coverage 
in addition  all hmos in new york are required to offer a standard product called healthy new york to individuals and certain qualifying small groups 
these requirements apply exclusively to hmos  and not to health insurers 
insurers and hmos in new jersey may opt to community rate small group business by class  so that rates may vary based on certain demographic factors  such as age and sex as well as location 
in new jersey  we have secured an exemption from offering direct pay coverage by paying an assessment to the state  but we do issue the standardized small group products required under new jersey law 
new york insurers may experience rate insurance coverage for large groups over employees and may apply medical underwriting rules to large groups  but the rates applicable to each member of the group cannot vary based on the individual s medical condition 
in new york  empire healthchoice hmo must offer almost all coverage on a community rated basis  although we may distinguish between large groups  small groups and individuals for purposes of establishing rates 
experience rating is permitted for our large group pos product 
new jersey insurers and hmos may experience rate insurance and hmo coverage for large groups 
insurers and hmos cannot terminate coverage of an employer group based on the medical conditions existing within that group 
in fact  they can cancel business for groups or individuals for only a limited number of 
table of contents reasons  such as fraud and default in payment of premium 
insurers and hmos cannot exclude coverage for a pre existing condition of a new employee of an existing employer group if that employee had previously satisfied a pre existing condition waiting period with the prior insurer and if that person maintained continuous coverage 
these limitations mirror the federal requirements established by the health insurance portability and accountability act of  or hipaa 
initial rates and rating formulae for all new products in new york require the prior approval of the new york department of insurance 
initial rates for all small group and individual products and large group hmo products in new jersey require the prior approval of the new jersey department of banking and insurance 
in new jersey  large group rates and rating methodologies for large group ppo products are not filed with the new jersey department of banking and insurance 
instead  a differential test is filed on a triennial basis  which shows that the value of the in network and out of network benefits including copayments and deductibles cannot differ by more than or  under certain circumstances  
rate increases on experience rated products in either state do not require prior approval  but in new york  must be consistent with the formula filed with the new york department of insurance 
rate increases on community rated products in new york generally can be implemented on a file and use basis that does not require the prior approval of the new york department of insurance 
with respect to rate changes for community rated products  the new jersey department of banking and insurance has days from the date of receipt of a rate filing to disapprove the filing 
unless the filing is disapproved  the insurer or hmo may use the form on the effective date specified within the filing 
as part of the plan of conversion  we agreed to several restrictions on premium rate increases relating to three categories of our individual members 
a discussion of these restrictions is described under item business the plan of conversion the legislation and the plan 
new york state hospital reimbursement 
new york hospital rates are governed by the health care reform act  which was adopted in the health care reform act eliminated new york s former state rate setting system and allows hospitals and health insurance companies to negotiate reimbursement rates 
the act also provides certain funding streams for public goods  including graduate medical expenses and charity care 
graduate medical education expenses are subsidized through a monthly per covered life assessment on insurers  hmos and self funded plans 
as part of the new york state budget legislation  this surcharge increased effective january  compensation for hospital bad debts and charity care and certain other programs are funded by a surcharge on hospital services 
we pay the surcharge directly to a state run pool 
as part of the new york state budget legislation  this assessment was increased  effective july   from to 
market stabilization and stop loss pools 
the new york state community rating law the community rating law requires insurers and hmos writing small employer groups with less than eligible employees and direct pay individual business to participate in certain market stabilization pools pools 
under the community rating law there are two major pools a pool for individual and small group contracts excluding medicare supplemental contracts non med supp pool and a pool for medicare supplemental contracts med supp pool 
both pools operate on a calendar year basis 
these pools are described in greater detail under item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources market stabilization pools 
other legislation 
during the past several years  new jersey and new york have enacted significant legislation relating to managed care plans 
these recent acts have contained provisions relating to  among other things  consumer disclosure  utilization review  removal of providers from the network  appeals processes for both providers and members  mandatory benefits and products  state funding pools  and provider contract requirements 
new york and new jersey also passed legislation governing the prompt payment of claims that require  among other things  that health plans pay claims within certain prescribed time periods or pay interest and fines 
we have not incurred significant fines for prompt pay violations since those laws became effective 

table of contents other recently adopted state laws  which govern our business and significantly affect our operations include  among others a law in new york  which became effective on january   mandates that health insurance plans provide or expand coverage for certain health care services 
the law requires that plans provide coverage for primary and preventive obstetrical and gynecological care  more frequent annual mammogram screenings  cervical cytology screenings  bone density testing and treatment  and contraceptive coverage 
we previously provided many of these benefits to our insured members 
a law passed in new jersey in which allows members to sue their health insurance plan for injuries caused by negligence  including delay  in making coverage decisions 
such litigation could be costly to us and could have a significant effect on our results of operations 
legislation in new jersey giving the state attorney general the authority to regulate the process by which physicians may jointly negotiate with health plans over fees and other contractual provisions which was passed into law in january and will expire in april the effectiveness of the law is subject to the issuance of regulations by the attorney general 
we cannot predict the ultimate impact this law will have on our business and results of operations in future periods 
foreign laws and regulations 
we may be subject to the laws of states other than those in which we are licensed with respect to persons we cover who reside in those states 
we may also be subject to scrutiny from regulatory agencies in those states 
we do not believe the costs related to compliance with such laws will have an adverse impact on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
insurance and hmo holding company laws wellchoice is regulated as an insurance holding company system and is subject to the insurance holding company laws and regulations of new york and new jersey as well as similar provisions included in the new york department of health regulations 
these laws and regulations generally require that insurers or hmos within an insurance holding company system register with the insurance or health department of each state where they are licensed to do business and to file with those states reports describing capital structure  ownership  financial condition  certain intercompany transactions and general business operations 
in addition  various notice and reporting requirements generally apply to transactions between insurance companies or hmos and their affiliates within an insurance holding company system  depending on the size and nature of the transactions 
these laws and regulations also require prior regulatory approval by domestic regulators or prior notice of certain material intercompany transfers of assets as well as certain transactions between insurance companies  hmos  their parent holding companies or affiliates 
additionally  the holding company laws and regulations of new york and new jersey and the department of health regulations in new york restrict the ability of any person to acquire control of an insurance company or hmo without prior regulatory approval 
applicable new york statutes and regulations require the prior approval of the commissioner of health for any acquisition of control of empire healthchoice hmo  empire or wellchoice  and the prior approval of the superintendent of insurance for any acquisition of control of empire or wellchoice 
similarly  new jersey law requires the prior approval of the commissioner of banking and insurance for any acquisition of control of wellchoice  empire  empire healthchoice hmo or wellchoice insurance of new jersey 
under those statutes and regulations  without such approval or an exemption  no person may acquire any voting security of a domestic insurance company or hmo  or an insurance holding company that controls a domestic insurance company or hmo  or merge with such a holding company  if as a result of such transaction such person would control a domestic insurance company or hmo 
control is generally defined by state insurance laws as the direct or indirect power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a person and is presumed to exist if a person directly or indirectly owns or controls or more of the voting securities of another person 

table of contents dividend restrictions the amount of dividends paid by insurance companies and hmos are limited by applicable state law and regulations in both new york and new jersey 
any proposed dividend to wellchoice from empire  which  together with other dividends paid within the preceding twelve month period  exceeds the lesser of of its surplus to policyholders or of adjusted net investment income will be subject to approval by the new york department of insurance 
the new jersey dividend restriction differs slightly from new york s in that any proposed dividend to empire from wellchoice insurance of new jersey  which  together with other dividends paid within the preceding twelve month period  exceeds the greater of of its surplus to policyholders or net income not including realized capital gains will be subject to approval by the department of banking and insurance 
dividends from both empire and wellchoice insurance of new jersey must be paid from earned surplus 
dividends from empire healthchoice hmo to empire in excess of of the admitted assets of empire healthchoice hmo will be subject to review and approval by the new york department of insurance  the new york department of health and the new jersey department of banking and insurance 
capital and reserve requirements empire is subject to capital and surplus requirements under the new york insurance laws and the capital and surplus licensure requirement established by the blue cross blue shield association 
each of these standards is based on the naic s rbc model act 
these capital and surplus requirements are intended to assess the capital adequacy of life  accident and health insurers and hmos  taking into account the risk characteristics of an insurer s investments and products 
the rbc model act sets forth the formula for calculating the risk based capital requirements  which are designed to take into account insurance risks  interest rate risks and other relevant risks with respect to an individual insurance company s business 
in general  under these laws  an insurance company must submit a report of its risk based capital level to the insurance commissioner of its state of domicile as of the end of the previous calendar year 
the rbc model act requires increasing degrees of regulatory oversight and intervention as an insurance company s risk based capital declines 
the level of regulatory oversight ranges from requiring the insurance company to inform and obtain approval from the domiciliary insurance commissioner of a comprehensive financial plan for increasing its risk based capital to mandatory regulatory intervention requiring an insurance company to be placed under regulatory control  in a rehabilitation or liquidation proceeding 
the rbc model act provides for four different levels of regulatory oversight depending on the ratio of the company s total adjusted capital defined as the total of its statutory capital  surplus  asset valuation reserve and dividend liability to its risk based capital 
the company action level is triggered if a company s total adjusted capital is less than  but greater than or equal to  of its risk based capital 
at the company action level  a company must submit a comprehensive plan to the regulatory authority which discusses proposed corrective actions to improve its capital position 
a company whose total adjusted capital is between and of its risk based capital is subject to a trend test 
the trend test calculates the greater of any decrease in the margin ie  the amount in dollars by which a company s adjusted capital exceeds its risk based capital between the current year and the prior year and between the current year and the average of the past three years  and assumes that the decrease could occur again in the coming year 
if a similar decrease in margin in the coming year would result in a risk based capital ratio of less than  then company action level regulatory action will occur 
the regulatory action level is triggered if a company s total adjusted capital is less than but greater than or equal to of its risk based capital 
at the regulatory action level  the regulatory authority will perform a special examination of the company and issue an order specifying corrective actions that must be followed 
the authorized control level is triggered if a company s total adjusted capital is less than but greater than or equal to of its risk based capital  at which level the regulatory authority may take any action it deems necessary  including placing the company under regulatory control 
the mandatory control level is triggered if a company s total adjusted capital is less than of its risk based capital  at which level the regulatory authority must place the company under its control 
empire currently exceeds the new york minimum risk based capital level and meets the blue cross blue shield association risk based capital level licensure requirement 

table of contents capital and surplus requirements for empire healthchoice hmo  inc  our hmo subsidiary which is directly owned by empire  are regulated under a different method set forth in the new york department of health s hmo regulations 
the regulations require that empire healthchoice hmo currently maintain reserves of five percent of its annual new york based premium income 
empire healthchoice hmo  with respect to its operations in new york  meets the financial reserve standards of the new york department of health 
the department of health is expected to publish regulations for adoption in the first half of that will increase the required reserves gradually over the next six years to twelve and one half percent of annual premium income 
if that requirement changes it will affect all hmos and we expect we will meet those revised standards 
in november  empire healthchoice hmo received a million capital contribution from empire  which was made in connection with the transfer of our new york hmo business from empire healthchoice  or healthchoice  to empire healthchoice hmo during in order to ensure compliance with new york capital and surplus requirements 
healthchoice was our parent company prior to our initial public offering in november empire healthchoice hmo is also licensed in new jersey and there are minimum net worth standards established under new jersey laws and regulations 
empire healthchoice hmo  with respect to its operations in new jersey  meets the minimum net worth standards established under new jersey law 
empire healthchoice hmo is also subject to the blue cross blue shield association capital and surplus licensure requirement which is applicable to empire and satisfies that requirement 
our new jersey operations are not subject to the blue cross blue shield association capital and surplus licensure requirement 
at december   wellchoice insurance of new jersey met the minimum capital and surplus requirements of the new jersey department of banking and insurance 
regulation of financial reserves for insurers and hmos is a frequent topic of legislative and regulatory scrutiny and proposals for change 
it is possible that the method of measuring the adequacy of our financial reserves could change and that could affect our financial condition 
however  any such change is likely to affect all companies in the state 
guaranty fund assessments new york does not have an insolvency or guaranty association law under which health insurance companies such as empire or empire healthchoice hmo can be assessed for amounts paid by guaranty funds for member losses incurred when an insurance company or hmo becomes insolvent 
new york does have a law providing that providers of care may not bring collection or litigation actions against consumers for bills unpaid by an insolvent hmo 
however  under blue cross blue shield association guidelines  empire and empire healthchoice hmo are required to establish a mechanism which ensures payment of certain claim liabilities and continuation of coverage in the event of insolvency 
empire and empire healthchoice hmo maintain a deposit agreement with the blue cross blue shield association for out of area services to provide such assurance 
the amount of the deposit is approximately of empire s and empire healthchoice hmo s unpaid claim reserves for out of area services 
at december   the market value and amortized cost of the investment on deposit were million and million  respectively 
wellchoice insurance of new jersey participates in the new jersey life and health insurance guaranty association  under which it may be required to pay assessments to the state of new jersey to provide funds to ensure that the liabilities arising under an impaired insurer s policies or contracts are paid when due 
the assessments are due only in the event another carrier is impaired 
since its inception  wellchoice insurance of new jersey has not been assessed any payments 
empire healthchoice hmo is subject to a new jersey law that requires new jersey hmos to contribute over a three year period to a fund established to meet unpaid contractual obligations of insolvent new jersey hmos 
to date  empire healthchoice hmo has paid assessments of approximately  as required under this law 

table of contents codification of naic standards the naic adopted the codification of statutory principles  or the codification  in march the effective date for the statutory accounting guidance was january  our domiciliary states have adopted the codification with certain modifications  and we have made the necessary changes in our statutory accounting and reporting required for implementation 
the overall impact of applying the new standards in resulted in an aggregate reduction in healthchoice s statutory surplus of million 
in  new york state passed legislation modifying the adopted codification which permitted us to recognize certain deferred tax assets 
the effect of this legislation resulted in an aggregate increase in empire s statutory surplus of million as of january  effective january   certain pharmacy rebates receivable were no longer admissible under new york regulations and as a result  empire s statutory surplus decreased by million 
federal regulation erisa 
the provision of services to certain employee health benefit plans is subject to erisa  a complex set of laws and regulations subject to interpretation and enforcement by the federal department of labor 
erisa regulates certain aspects of the relationships between us and employers who maintain employee benefit plans subject to erisa 
some of our administrative services and other activities may also be subject to regulation under erisa 
of particular application are the regulations recently adopted by the department of labor that revise claims procedures for employee benefit plans governed by erisa insured and self funded  effective for claims filed on or after july  given that the state insurance laws in new york and new jersey  as well as many other states  already contain stringent claim appeal process requirements  the rules have not significantly impacted our operations 
however  we cannot predict the ultimate impact on its business and results of operations in future periods 
hipaa 
hipaa required the adoption of regulations accomplishing three things ensuring the privacy of personally identifiable health information  ensuring the security of personally identifiable health information  and standardizing the way certain health care transactions such as claims are handled when they are conducted electronically  and establishing national identifiers for providers  health plans and employers 
the federal department of health and human services adopted final rules on these topics 
the hipaa privacy rules require health plans  clearinghouses and providers to comply with a variety of requirements concerning their use and disclosure of individuals protected health information  establish rigorous internal procedures to protect health information  enter into business associate contracts with those companies to whom protected health information is disclosed  and establish procedures to allow individuals to access and amend records maintained by empire  receive an accounting of certain disclosures  and to establish grievance processes for individuals to make inquiries or complaints regarding the privacy of their records 
we have been in compliance with these privacy requirements since their april  effective date 
in accordance with the final rules standardizing electronic transactions between health plans  providers and clearinghouses  those parties are required to conform their electronic and data processing systems with hipaa s electronic transaction requirements 
the compliance date for these rules was delayed until october for those plans  including the company  that filed an extension request by october our electronic and data processing systems were fully capable of conducting all electronic transactions in compliance with the rules by 
table of contents the compliance date 
however  to address the fact that a significant number of parties  including health care providers  were not ready to conduct transactions in a hipaa compliant format by october  cms asked commercial health plans like us to adopt a contingency plan to allow our trading partners to continue to use a non compliant format for a limited period of time to help ensure a smooth transition 
we have cooperated with this request 
by the end of this transition period  which will be determined by cms  all electronic transactions will be conducted in compliance with these rules 
states may adopt more stringent requirements for health care information privacy and security than the standards set by hipaa 
the final security standards became effective on february  we must comply with the security standards by april  they require covered entities to implement a variety of security measures to protect electronic protected health information and include security standards and implementation specifications grouped under one of three categories administrative  physical and technical safeguards 
while we currently have adequate safeguards in place to protect health information  we are developing additional processes to enable us to implement security measures to comply with the rules 
we expect to be fully compliant by april  in addition  provisions of the federal gramm leach bliley act generally require insurers to protect the privacy of consumers and customers non public personal information and authorize state regulators to enact and enforce privacy standards that meet at least the federal minimum requirements 
like hipaa  this law sets a floor standard  allowing states to adopt more stringent requirements governing privacy protection 
in compliance with the gramm leach bliley act  the new york state department of insurance issued privacy and security regulations affording new york consumers and customers privacy protections and notice rights 
new jersey already had laws regulating the collection  use and disclosure of information that met or exceeded the gramm leach bliley act requirements  and therefore the new jersey department of banking and insurance stated that compliance with state law by insurers transacting business in new jersey is deemed to be compliance with the requirements of the gramm leach bliley act 
the gramm leach bliley act also gives banks and other financial institutions the ability to affiliate with insurance companies  which may lead to new competitors in the insurance and health benefits fields 
our external costs for hipaa compliance through were million  inclusive of the million spent in in early  final rules were adopted under hipaa that mandate the use of standard national provider identifiers as the standard unique health identifier for health care providers to be used in filing and processing health care claims and other transactions by may we cannot predict the ultimate impact hipaa will have on our business and results of operations in future periods 
medicare empire healthchoice hmo operates a medicare choice plan pursuant to a contract with cms under the federal department of health and human services  and that contract is subject to applicable federal laws and regulations 
our medicare choice members receive their medicare benefits from our hmo rather than directly from the federal government under the standard medicare part a and part b programs 
cms has the right to audit health plans operating under medicare contracts to determine their compliance with cms s contracts and regulations and the quality of care being rendered to the health plan s medicare members 
the contract to participate in the medicare choice program could  under certain circumstances  be terminated by the federal government or by us 
in  the federal government passed legislation related to medicare choice that  among other things  provided for a minimum annual premium rate increase of two percent 
the legislation also required us to pay a user fee to reimburse cms for costs incurred to disseminate enrollment information 
the federal government also announced in that it planned to begin to phase in risk adjustments to its premium payments that will occur over several years 
congress subsequently lengthened this timetable to allow the risk adjusted mechanism to be fully implemented by these changes have had the effect of reducing reimbursement to us in our new york service areas  forcing us to adjust the medicare choice package of covered benefits 
these changes have decreased the attractiveness of the product to consumers 

table of contents in december  the president signed into law the medicare prescription improvement and modernization act  or mma  which alters the medicare choice program 
under the mma  medicare choice plans will receive increased funding in and from cms  which must be used for limited purposes such as to increase benefits or decrease premiums 
we recently filed a plan with cms to use the additional funding to reduce or eliminate additional premiums we receive from medicare choice members in those parts of our service area where the additional premiums apply and to increase benefits in other regions 
the plan is subject to approval by cms 
the mma also amends the entire medicare choice program  which starting in will be known as the medicare advantage program and will include hmos  regional ppos that cover entire regions  health savings accounts  or hsas  and other plans 
payment under this program will be based on the submission of bids by plans who wish to participate in the program 
a major component of the mma is the creation of a medicare part d program providing beneficiaries with coverage for outpatient prescription drugs beginning january  beginning in  all medicare beneficiaries will have the option of choosing prescription drug coverage as a stand alone benefit or by joining a medicare advantage hmo  regional ppo  hsa or other permitted health plan 
medicare advantage hmos and ppos will be required to offer an out patient prescription benefit to medicare beneficiaries as either a standard benefit or through an approved alternative coverage with actuarially equivalent benefits 
the mma also provides for an interim voluntary prescription drug card beginning in may through that will provide enrollees  in exchange for a small enrollment fee  with access to negotiated discounts for prescription drugs 
low income beneficiaries will not have to pay the annual fee and will receive an annual credit of as federal assistance that may be applied to drug benefit copayments and deductibles with the balance available to pay for uncovered drugs or drug costs that exceed a plan s benefit cap 
we will not sponsor a prescription drug card  but intend to co brand a prescription drug card with our pharmacy benefit management vendor mma also provides for tax advantaged health savings accounts hsas  effective january   to help eligible individuals with high deductible health insurance plans pay for qualified medical expenses 
hsa contributions are permitted up to the applicable plan deductibles  with a cap of  for individuals and  for families 
hsas may be offered by employers of all sizes and both the employer and employee can contribute 
employer contributions will not be counted as income and individual contributions will be tax deductible 
hsa balances may be rolled over and accumulated from year to year 
we also serve as a fiscal intermediary for the medicare part a program and a carrier for the medicare part b program 
fiscal intermediaries and carriers for these programs act as agents under contract to the federal government to process and pay claims for one or more designated regions of the united states under the medicare part a program for hospital care and the medicare part b program for physician and other care 
our contracts with the federal government are cost based which means we receive reimbursement for certain costs and expenditures from the federal government  which is subject to adjustment upon audit by cms 
the laws and regulations governing fiscal intermediaries and carriers for the medicare program are complex and subject to interpretation and can expose an intermediary to penalties for non compliance 
fiscal intermediaries and carriers may be subject to criminal fines  civil penalties or other sanctions as a result of such audits or reviews 
while we believe we are currently in compliance in all material respects with the regulations governing fiscal intermediaries and carriers  there are ongoing reviews by the federal government of our activities under our medicare fiscal intermediary and carrier contracts 
the contracts could  under certain circumstances  be terminated either by the federal government or by us 
the medicare program is annually the subject of legislation in congress and we cannot predict what additional rules and requirements may be enacted that will impact our business 

table of contents other government programs new york state mandates and or sponsors several health benefit products for persons who might otherwise be uninsured or require assistance in paying premiums 
these include the child health plus  healthy new york and other state mandated direct pay products 
all hmos are mandated by law to participate in the healthy new york and other state mandated direct pay products and empire healthchoice hmo participates in all of these programs 
the child health plus program has extensive rules regarding participation and the contract to participate could  under certain circumstances  be terminated by the state government or by us 
in new jersey  insurers are required to offer certain standard products in the small group market 
we have obtained an exemption from the requirement that we offer direct pay non group coverage in new jersey by virtue of an assessment paid to the state 
in addition  we participate in the federal employee health benefits program fep through a contract with the blue cross blue shield association 
currently  other fep contractors are required to comply with federal cost accounting standards 
the blue cross blue shield association has a waiver from compliance with these standards which must be renewed annually 
failure to renew this waiver could adversely impact this program  and could result in the blue cross blue shield association s withdrawal from the program  although regulations are currently being drafted that could make the waiver permanent 
legislative and regulatory initiatives there has been a continuing trend of increased health care regulation at both the federal and state levels 
the federal government and many states  including new york and new jersey  are considering additional legislation and regulations related to health care plans  including  among other things requiring coverage of experimental procedures and drugs and liberalized definitions of medical necessity  limiting utilization review and cost management and cost control initiatives of our managed care subsidiaries  requiring  at the new york state level  that mental health benefits be treated the same as medical benefits in addition to the existing federal law that imposes requirements relating to parity of mental health benefits  exempting physicians from the antitrust laws that prohibit price fixing  group boycotts and other horizontal restraints on competition  regulating premium rates  including prior approval of rate changes by regulatory authorities  changing the government programs for the uninsured or those who need assistance in paying premiums  including potential mandates that all hmos or insurers must participate  implementing a state run single payer system that would partially or largely obviate the current role of private health insurers or hmos  and restricting or eliminating the use of formularies for prescription drugs 
in  congress considered  but did not adopt  legislation authorizing association health plans or ahps to offer health insurance coverage to small groups without state oversight 
specifically  ahps would be exempt from state insurance laws and subject to minimal federal rules and oversight 
state regulated health plans would remain subject to state rules and oversight  thus requiring them to compete with largely unregulated entities for business 
in his state of the union address in january  the president again proposed adoption of legislation authorizing ahps 
the proposed regulatory and legislative changes described above  if enacted  could increase health care costs and administrative expenses  reduce medicare reimbursement rates and otherwise adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we cannot predict whether any of the proposed legislation will be enacted 

table of contents the plan of conversion background on september   healthchoice announced its intention to restructure to a for profit company  based on significant changes in both the regulatory environment and the marketplace affecting the health insurance industry 
in july  healthchoice filed a proposed plan of restructuring with the new york department of insurance  which was revised in november following public hearings 
on december   the superintendent of insurance approved the plan with some modification 
this plan was never implemented 
the legislation and the plan in january  the governor of the state of new york signed into law chapter one of the new york laws of  which we refer to as the conversion legislation  providing an express statutory basis for healthchoice s right to convert to a for profit company 
prior to our initial public offering  healthchoice was our parent company 
the conversion legislation  specifically section j and section of the new york insurance law  clarified the statutory authority for the superintendent of insurance s review and approval of a conversion plan 
accordingly  on june   healthchoice filed an amended plan of conversion seeking the superintendent s approval to convert under the terms of the conversion legislation 
healthchoice also requested and obtained approvals from the superintendent and  where necessary  from the new york commissioner of health  the new jersey department of banking and insurance  cms and the blue cross blue shield association for certain transactions related to the plan of conversion 
on august and   public hearings took place in new york city and albany  respectively  with respect to the plan of conversion 
healthchoice further amended and refiled the plan of conversion on september  in response to various issues raised at the public hearings 
on october   the superintendent issued an opinion and decision approving the plan of conversion and concluding that the conversion is in compliance with the conversion legislation and does not violate any applicable laws or regulations 
the approval and conclusions were subject to several conditions  including the approval by the superintendent  the commissioner and cms of certain of the agreements that we entered into in connection with the conversion  all of which were satisfied 
the plan of conversion  as required by the conversion legislation  provided for safeguards to ensure consumers continued or increased access to coverage and consumer outreach  the method for the transfer of contract forms to ensure that current members were not adversely affected by the conversion and had uninterrupted coverage  the conversion of healthchoice from a not for profit corporation into a for profit corporation  and the procedures which we were required to take in completing our conversion  including the series of transactions that resulted in the new york public asset fund  or the fund  and the new york charitable asset foundation  or the foundation  initially owning all of our shares 
the fund and the foundation were established by new york state under the conversion legislation to receive the value of healthchoice as part of healthchoice s conversion to a for profit company 
as contemplated by the plan  following healthchoice s conversion into a for profit corporation and prior to the effectiveness of our initial public offering  the converted healthchoice transferred and of its capital stock to the fund and the foundation  respectively 
the fund and the foundation then transferred their shares in the converted healthchoice to wellchoice holdings of new york  inc  or holdings  a then newly formed wholly owned  for profit subsidiary and the parent company of our principal insurance operating subsidiaries  in exchange for a corresponding amount of our common stock 
consequently  immediately prior to the completion of the offering  wellchoice was owned by the fund and owned by the foundation 
as part of these transactions  the converted healthchoice merged with empire healthchoice assurance  inc  healthchoice s 
table of contents indirect  wholly owned subsidiary and existing for profit insurer  with healthchoice surviving as empire healthchoice assurance  inc that entity then transferred its administrative and managerial functions to us 
in connection with the transactions described in this paragraph  the fund obtained an exemption from acquisition of control requirements from the superintendent and the commissioner in order to hold or more of the outstanding shares of our common stock 
as a result of these transactions  wellchoice became an insurance holding company with holdings owning our insurance operating subsidiaries 
as required by the conversion legislation  immediately following the conversion  of the fair market value of healthchoice  by virtue of the proceeds from their respective sale of shares and the ownership of their remaining initial shares of wellchoice  was held by the fund and by the foundation 
in connection with the conversion  healthchoice transferred and assigned  and wellchoice received and assumed  certain assets and liabilities  including leases and contracts associated with the provision of administrative and management services to our insurance hmo subsidiaries 
wellchoice was incorporated in delaware in august prior to the completion of the conversion and our initial public offering  wellchoice did not engage in any operations 
as part of the plan of conversion  we agreed to several restrictions on premium rate increases relating to three categories of our individual members 
the first category is a small group of members who currently are covered under a comprehensive individual indemnity policy that is no longer sold by us 
this group of members is eligible for medicare by reason of disability and would not be eligible to purchase comparable coverage if their policies were terminated 
current law applicable to us and the conversion legislation prohibits us from discontinuing these policies 
there are fewer than individuals covered under these policies and new enrollment is prohibited 
we agreed in the plan of conversion that we will not discontinue these policies and that we will not increase rates on these policies by more than or such lesser amount as may be required if the current statute is amended to provide a lower maximum for file and use rates in any month period without the superintendent s prior approval  which may only be granted following a public hearing 
the second category relates to members covered by our individual medicare supplemental policies and the third category relates to our individual direct pay voluntary indemnity policies 
currently  we offer three standard medicare supplemental packages  a  b and h  and approximately  individuals are covered under these policies and approximately  members are covered under our individual direct pay voluntary indemnity policies 
we agreed that  with respect to the premium rates applicable to our individual medicare supplemental policies and our individual direct pay voluntary indemnity policies  we will comply with certain provisions of the new york insurance law in effect on december  relating to premium rate increases for persons covered under policies issued by article not for profit insurers for a period of five years and three years  respectively  following the effective date of the conversion 
specifically  for rate increases applicable to individual medicare supplemental policies and individual direct pay voluntary indemnity policies during the five year and three year periods  respectively we may utilize the file and use rate methodology filed rates will be deemed approved days after submission for rate increases of up to annually  or such lower amount as may be required if the current statute is amended to provide a lower maximum for file and use rates provided that the policies do not have a medical loss ratio less than a minimum of  and the superintendent s prior approval following a public hearing will be required for increases that exceed annually 
in addition  we agreed that with respect to our medicare supplemental policies  rate increases during the sixth  seventh and eighth years following november   the effective date of the conversion  may be implemented upon filing under the file and use methodology  provided we have a medical loss ratio of at least the ratio otherwise applicable to not for profit insurers  in contrast to the minimum that is applicable 
table of contents to medicare supplemental policies issued by for profit health insurers 
during this period  any application for medicare supplemental policy rate increases with a medical loss ratio below will require the prior approval of the superintendent following a public hearing 
at the end of the eighth year following the effective date of the conversion  the premium rates for these policies will be subject to the rules applicable to all other for profit health insurers 
additional factors that may affect future results of operations our inability to address health care costs and implement increases in premium rates could negatively affect our profitability 
our profitability depends in large part on accurately predicting health care costs and on our ability to manage future health care costs through underwriting criteria  quality initiatives and medical management  product design and negotiation of favorable provider reimbursement rates 
the following includes factors that are beyond our control and may adversely affect our ability to predict and manage health care costs higher than expected utilization of services  an increase in the number of high cost cases  changes in the population or demographic characteristics of members served  including aging of the population  an unexpected increase in provider reimbursement rates due to unfavorable rate negotiations medical cost inflation  changes in healthcare practices  cost of prescription drugs and direct to consumer marketing by pharmaceutical companies  the introduction of new medical technology and pharmaceuticals  and the enactment of legislation that requires us to expand the delivery of required benefits 
in addition to the challenge of managing health care costs  we face pressure to contain prices for our products 
our customer contracts may be subject to renegotiations as customers seek to contain their costs 
alternatively  our customers may move to a competitor to obtain more favorable prices 
a limitation on our ability to increase or maintain our prices could result in reduced revenues and earnings which could have an adverse impact on the trading prices of our common stock and the value of your investment 
a reduction in enrollment in our products could affect our business and profitability 
a reduction in the number of members in our products could reduce our revenues and profitability 
factors that could contribute to a reduction in membership include failure to obtain new customers or retain existing customers  premium increases and benefit changes  failure to successfully implement our growth strategy  failure to provide innovative products that meet the needs of our customers or potential customers  our exit from a specific market  reductions in workforce by existing customers  negative publicity and news coverage  and a general economic downturn that results in business failures 

table of contents regional concentration of our business may subject us to economic downturns in new york state and  in particular  the new york city metropolitan area 
we operate in counties in new york state and substantially all of our revenue is derived from group accounts that have an office in our service areas in new york state or from individual members who reside in the state 
this concentration of business in new york exposes us to potential losses resulting from a downturn in the economy of new york state and  in particular  new york city 
the events of september  and the economic recession have had a negative economic impact on business in new york city as well as new york state 
in addition  a nationwide economic downturn could have an adverse impact on our national accounts business 
if economic conditions continue to deteriorate  we may experience a reduction in existing and new business  which may have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  as a high profile  diverse and highly populated city  new york city could be the target of future terrorist attacks  including bioterrorism and other public health threats  which could significantly increase the risks of our business  such as the risk of significant increases in costs of benefits provided following such an event 
for example  a bioterrorism attack could cause increased utilization of healthcare services  including physician and hospital services  high cost prescription drugs and other services 
significant competition from other health care companies could negatively affect our ability to maintain or increase our profitability 
our business operates in a highly competitive environment  both in the states of new york and new jersey as well as nationally 
competition in our industry has intensified in recent years  due to more aggressive marketing and pricing practices by other health care organizations  a customer base which focuses on quality while still being price sensitive and the introduction of new products for which health insurance companies must compete for members 
this environment has produced  and will likely continue to produce  significant pressures on the profitability of health insurance companies 
concentration in our industry also has created an increasingly competitive environment  both for customers and for potential acquisition targets  which may make it difficult for us to grow our business 
some of our competitors are larger and have greater financial and other resources than we do 
we may have difficulty competing with larger health insurance companies  which can create downward price pressures on provider rates through economies of scale 
we may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors 
in addition  in recent years  the nature and means by which participants in the health care and health insurance industries market products and deliver services have changed rapidly 
we believe this trend will continue  requiring us to continue to respond to new and  possibly  unanticipated competitive developments 
competitive pressures faced by us may adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
medicare premiums may not keep up with the cost of health care services we provide under our medicare choice product 
we offer a medicare choice product through our new york hmo operations 
under the medicare choice program  medicare beneficiaries have the option of receiving their care through an hmo instead of the traditional medicare fee for service program 
at december   we had approximately  members enrolled in medicare choice  or of our commercial managed care membership  which accounted for of our commercial managed care premium revenue for the year ended december  in connection with this product  we receive a fixed per member per month  or pmpm  capitation payment from cms  the federal agency that administers the medicare program 
in some counties in which we offer the medicare choice program  we receive additional premiums from our members 
we bear the risk that the actual cost of covered health services may exceed the amount we receive from cms and our members 
this can happen if the utilization of health care services increases at a faster rate than we expect or if our hospitals and providers demand larger increases than we anticipated 
if the costs of health care exceed the amount we receive from cms  we may be required to increase supplemental premiums or decrease the level of benefits offered 
these changes 
table of contents may make our product less attractive to medicare beneficiaries and  as a result  our medicare choice membership could decrease 
our membership could also decrease as a result of our departure from certain counties that we currently serve 
the recently enacted medicare prescription improvement and modernization act  or mma  also amends the entire medicare choice program 
under the mma  medicare choice plans will receive increased funding in and from cms  which must be used for limited purposes such as to increase benefits or decrease premiums 
the increased funding may result in new entrants offering this product as well as other companies expanding their service areas for this product offering 
under the mma  starting in  the program will be known as the medicare advantage program and will include hmos  regional ppos that cover entire regions  health savings accounts  or hsas  and other plans 
payment under this program will be based on the submission of bids 
the bidding process could result in reduced levels of payment from cms under the medicare advantage hmo program 
in addition  we do not operate statewide in new york and accordingly may not be able to compete successfully against other statewide ppos in the medicare advantage program once competitive bidding is initiated in we may not otherwise be successful in our ability to retain our medicare choice hmo business or to secure additional business in the medicare advantage program 
as a medicare fiscal intermediary  we are subject to complex regulations 
if we fail to comply with these regulations  we may be exposed to criminal sanctions and significant civil penalties 
empire is a fiscal intermediary for the medicare part a program and a carrier for the medicare part b program  which provide hospital and physician coverage to persons years or older 
as a fiscal intermediary  we serve as an administrative agent for the traditional medicare fee for service program and receive reimbursement for certain costs and expenditures  which are subject to adjustment upon audit by cms 
the laws and regulations governing fiscal intermediaries for the medicare program are complex  subject to interpretation and can expose a fiscal intermediary to penalties for non compliance 
fiscal intermediaries may be subject to criminal fines  civil penalties or other sanctions as a result of such audits or reviews 
however  there can be no assurance that our compliance program will be adequate or that regulatory changes or other developments which occur in the future will not result in infractions of the cms requirements 
we are dependent on the success of our relationship with ibm for a significant portion of our information system resources 
in june  we entered into an agreement with international business machines corporation  or ibm  pursuant to which ibm undertook to assist us in enhancing and modernizing our information systems 
in addition  under this agreement  we have outsourced a portion of our core applications development and our data center operations to ibm for a period of ten years 
also under this agreement  ibm  through a strategic relationship with denovis  inc  a claims payment systems developer  has agreed to develop a new claims payment system which will be licensed to us in perpetuity 
denovis  inc is a privately held start up company 
we will materially rely on these developments and improvements of our core technology operations on a going forward basis 
strategic relationships such as the one we have with ibm can be difficult to implement and maintain  and may not succeed for various reasons including changes in strategic direction by one or both companies  technical obstacles to developing the technologies  the insolvency  merger or change of control of one of the parties  difficulties in coordinating joint development efforts  difficulties in structuring and maintaining revenue sharing arrangements  and operating differences between the companies and their respective employees 

table of contents as a start up company  denovis lacks a steady operating history and has incurred net losses and negative cash flow since its inception in we are aware that denovis has had several changes in management since the inception of our contract with ibm and has failed to meet key developmental goals with a third party relating to a claims payment system  which has been expected to serve as the base point for the development of our claims payment system 
as a result  ibm has failed to meet key development milestones under the project plan it has with us for the development of our claims payment system 
ibm has recently informed us that the system under development by denovis is not expected to be ready for acceptance by us in accordance with its specifications any earlier than the fall of ibm may be unable to develop our claims engine in accordance with our contract or at all  in which event we would likely continue to use our existing claims payment system  but would need to invest significant funds to update that system over the mid to long term or otherwise transition to another claims payment system 
if our relationship with ibm is terminated for any reason or if we are unable to successfully develop and implement the technological improvements and innovations contemplated by the agreement with ibm  we may not be able to find an alternative partner in a timely manner or on acceptable financial terms with whom we will be able to pursue our strategy 
as a result  we may not be able to meet the demands of our customers and  in turn  our business  financial condition and results of operations may be harmed 
in addition  we intend to fund the modernization expenses incurred in connection with this collaboration with ibm in part through the cost savings we expect to realize as a result of the outsourcing of this project to ibm 
any substantial increase in these expenses  or inability to achieve our anticipated cost savings  could have an adverse effect on our profitability  financial condition and results of operations 
we do not expect to realize significant cost savings from these improvements in the early years of the project 
if we are unsuccessful in implementing these improvements or if these improvements do not meet our customers requirements  we may not be able to recoup these costs and expenses and effectively compete in our industry 
some of the risks associated with the collaboration with ibm are anticipated and covered through termination rights clauses and indemnification clauses included under our outsourcing agreement 
nevertheless  we may not be adequately indemnified against all possible losses through the terms and conditions of the agreement 
in addition  some of our termination rights are contingent upon payment of a fee  which may be significant 
a substantial legal liability or a significant regulatory action against us could have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we are  and may in the future be  a party to a variety of legal actions that affect any business  such as employment and employment discrimination related suits  employee benefit claims  breach of contract actions  tort claims and intellectual property related litigation 
in addition  because of the nature of our business  we are subject to a variety of legal and regulatory actions relating to our business operations or to our industry  including the design  management and offering of our products and services 
recent court decisions and legislative activity may increase our exposure for litigation claims 
in some cases  substantial non economic  treble or punitive damages may be sought 
the loss of even one claim  if it resulted in a significant punitive damages award  could significantly worsen our financial condition or results of operations 
this risk of potential liability may make reasonable settlements of claims more difficult to obtain 
we currently have insurance coverage for some of these potential liabilities 
other potential liabilities may not be recovered by insurance  insurers may dispute coverage or the amount of insurance may not be enough to cover the damages awarded 
in addition  certain types of damages  such as punitive damages  may not be covered by insurance and insurance coverage for all or certain forms of liability may become unavailable or prohibitively expensive in the future 

table of contents in september  a group of plaintiffs trial lawyers publicly announced that they were targeting the managed care industry by way of class action litigation 
since that time  two actions  one purporting to be a class action on behalf of providers and the other brought by the medical society of the state of new york  have been commenced against us generally challenging managed care practices  including cost containment mechanisms  disclosure obligations and payment methodologies 
in august  a similar nation wide federal putative class action was brought against empire  the blue cross blue shield association and virtually every blues plan in the country  on behalf of all medical doctors and doctors of osteopathy 
this action  known as the thomas litigation  like the two pending state actions  generally challenges managed care practices  including cost containment mechanisms  disclosure obligations and payment methodologies 
in october  a substantially similar federal putative class action was brought against empire  the blue cross blue shield association and virtually every blues plan in the country  on behalf of ancillary providers  such as podiatrists  psychologists  chiropractors  physical therapists  optometrists  opticians  social workers  nurse practitioners and acupuncturists 
again  like thomas  this action  known as the solomon litigation  raises similar allegations  except for the added allegation that we subject claims submitted by ancillary providers to stricter scrutiny than claims submitted by medical doctors and doctors of osteopathy 
we intend to defend vigorously all of these cases 
we will incur defense costs and we cannot predict the outcome of these cases 
certain potential liabilities may not be covered by insurance  and a large judgment against us or a settlement could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations our profitability may be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain our current provider agreements and to enter into other appropriate agreements 
our profitability is dependent in part upon our ability to contract on favorable terms with hospitals  physicians and other health benefits providers 
our agreements with these providers generally have fixed terms which require that we renegotiate them periodically 
the failure to maintain or secure new cost effective health care provider contracts may result in a loss in membership or higher costs of benefits provided 
in addition  our inability to contract with providers on favorable terms  or the inability of providers to provide cost effective care  could adversely affect our business 
large groups of physicians  hospitals and other providers have in recent years begun to collectively renegotiate their contracts with health insurance companies like us 
in addition  physicians  hospitals and other provider groups continue to consolidate to create hospital networks 
this cooperation and or consolidation among providers increases their bargaining positions and allows the providers to negotiate for higher reimbursement rates from us 
demands for higher reimbursement rates may lead to increased premium rates  the loss of beneficial hospitals and physicians and a disruption of service for our members  which in turn could cause a decrease in existing and new business 
if this practice increases or continues for an extended period of time  it could have an adverse affect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  magellan behavioral health  inc  which arranges for the provision of behavioral health benefits to our members  emerged from chapter bankruptcy in january after having undergone a capital restructuring 
magellan may not be able to operate or provide the level of service it provided to us before it encountered financial difficulties 
in addition  our agreement with magellan is subject to renewal in and we may not be able to negotiate renewal terms that are favorable to us 
if we are unable to renew our agreement with magellan  we will need to obtain another network for behavioral health services outside our service area and we may not be able to secure another network on terms satisfactory to us 
advancepcs provides pharmacy benefit management services to our members pursuant to a contract that expires december  caremark rx inc recently entered into an agreement to acquire advancepcs 
if that transaction is consummated  it will result in further consolidation of the pharmacy benefit manager industry  which already is highly concentrated 
such consolidation could adversely affect our ability to negotiate favorable payment terms with advancepcs or any other pharmacy benefit manager at the end of our current contract with advancepcs 

table of contents our business is heavily regulated and changes in state and federal regulations may adversely affect the profitability of our business  our financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to extensive regulation and supervision by the new york state department of insurance  or department of insurance  and the new york state department of health  or department of health  with respect to our new york operations  the new jersey department of banking and insurance  with respect to our new jersey operations  as well as to regulation by federal agencies with respect to our federal programs 
these laws and regulations are subject to amendments and changing interpretations in each jurisdiction 
our insurance subsidiaries are also subject to insurance laws that establish supervisory agencies with broad administrative powers to grant and revoke licenses to transact business and otherwise regulate sales  policy forms and rates  financial reporting  solvency requirements  investments and other practices 
future regulatory action by state insurance authorities could have an adverse effect on the profitability or marketability of our health benefits or managed care products or on our and our subsidiaries business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  because of our participation in government sponsored programs  such as medicare  changes in government regulations or policies with respect to  among other things  reimbursement levels  could also adversely affect our and our subsidiaries business  financial condition and results of operations 
moreover  state legislatures and the united states congress continue to focus on health care issues 
congress is considering various forms of patients bill of rights legislation which  if adopted  could fundamentally alter the treatment of coverage decisions under the employee retirement income security act of  or erisa 
additionally  there recently have been legislative attempts to limit erisa s preemptive effect on state laws 
if adopted  such limitations could increase our liability exposure and could permit greater state regulation of our operations 
other proposed bills and regulations at state and federal levels may impact certain aspects of our business  including agent licensing  corporate governance  permissible investments  market conduct  provider contracting  claims payments and processing and confidentiality of health information 
in addition  the new york governor s fiscal budget proposed increases to assessments imposed on insurers and the transfer of some early intervention services from state sponsored programs to private insurers 
while we cannot predict if any of these initiatives will ultimately become effective or  if enacted  what their terms will be  their enactment could increase our costs  expose us to expanded liability or require us to revise the ways in which we conduct business 
acquisitions or investments that we may make could turn out to be unsuccessful 
as part of our growth strategy  we may in the future pursue acquisitions of and or investments in businesses  products and services 
the negotiation of potential acquisitions or investments as well as the integration of an acquired or jointly developed business  service or product could result in a substantial diversion of management resources 
we could be competing with other firms  many of which have greater financial and other resources  to acquire attractive companies 
acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurrence or assumption of debt and contingent liabilities  amortization of certain identifiable intangible assets  write offs and other acquisition related expenses 
in addition  we may also fail to successfully integrate acquired businesses with our operations or successfully realize the intended benefits of any acquisition or investment 
pending litigation challenging the conversion legislation could adversely affect the terms of the plan of conversion and the price of our common stock 
on august   consumers union of us  inc  the new york statewide senior action council and several other groups and individuals filed a lawsuit in new york supreme court challenging the conversion legislation on several constitutional grounds  including that it impairs the plaintiffs contractual rights  impairs the plaintiffs property rights without due process of law  and constitutes an unreasonable taking of property 
in addition  the lawsuit alleges that healthchoice has violated section of the new york not for profit corporation law and that the directors of healthchoice breached their fiduciary duties  among other things  in approving the plan of conversion 
the complaint seeks a permanent injunction enjoining the conversion or 
table of contents portions of the conversion 
on september   we responded to this complaint by moving to dismiss the plaintiffs complaint in its entirety on several grounds 
on november   pursuant to a motion filed by plaintiffs  the new york supreme court issued a temporary restraining order temporarily enjoining and restraining the transfer of the proceeds of the sale of common stock by the selling stockholders in this offering to the fund or the foundation or to the state or any of its agencies or instrumentalities 
the court also ordered that such proceeds be deposited with the comptroller of the state of new york pending the outcome of this action 
the court did not enjoin wellchoice  healthchoice or the other defendants from completing the conversion or our initial public offering 
a court conference was held on november   at which time the motion to dismiss and the motion to convert the temporary restraining order into a preliminary injunction were deemed submitted 
on march   the court delivered its decision dated february   in which it dismissed all of the plaintiffs claims in the complaint 
the decision grants two of the plaintiffs  consumers union and one other group  leave to replead the complaint  which they did on april   to allege that the conversion legislation violates the state constitution on the ground that it applies exclusively to healthchoice 
on may   the defendants filed motions to dismiss the amended complaint in its entirety  for failure to state a claim 
on october   the court dismissed all claims against the individual members of the board of directors of healthchoice  but denied defendants motions to dismiss the amended complaint 
in its decision  the court stated that the plaintiffs decision to limit their request for preliminary relief to restraining the disposition of the selling stockholders proceeds of the initial public offering  but not to block the offering  may affect such ultimate relief as may be granted in the action 
the parties have agreed to stay the lower court proceedings  pending resolution of defendants appeal of the court s decision and plaintiffs earlier appeal of the court s dismissal of all claims in the initial complaint to the new york state appellate division  first department 
pending a further order of the court  the temporary restraining order remains in effect and the plaintiff s motion for a preliminary injunction is deferred 
during october and november  the parties filed their appeals and thereafter provided written briefs of their arguments on appeal 
oral argument on the appeals was held on january  if the plaintiffs are successful in this litigation  there could be substantial uncertainty as to the terms and effectiveness of the plan of conversion  including the conversion of healthchoice into a for profit corporation  the issuance of the shares of our common stock in the conversion  or the sale of our common stock in the initial public offering 
in addition  new litigation challenging the conversion legislation could also be filed 
such developments could have an adverse impact on our ability to conduct our business and could have an adverse impact on prevailing market prices of our common stock

for a discussion of this action  see item business additional factors that may affect future results of operations 
medical society of the state of new york 
we and several of our affiliates have been named as defendants in a class action lawsuit brought by five physicians on behalf of a purported class of all members of the medical society of the state of new york 
the suit  cheng v 
empire  was filed on or about august  in the supreme court of the state of new york  new york county 
the plaintiffs allege that the defendants are engaged in various activities in violation of statute or contract  including bundling for payment separate healthcare services that occurred on the same date  unjustifiably denying increased levels of reimbursement for complicated medical cases  improperly employing software programs to automatically downcode claims for procedures and use of inappropriate medical necessity guidelines  failure to employ adequate staff so as to frustrate payments  failure to pay interest as required by law on past due claims and forcing physicians to enter into one sided managed care physician agreements 
the plaintiffs seek an award of compensatory or actual damages 
a second action was also commenced on or about august   captioned medical society of the state of new york v 
empire in the supreme court of the state of new york  new york county 
this case makes allegations virtually identical to those in the cheng case 
the medical society seeks  however  a declaration that the challenged practices violate various provisions of state law and a permanent injunction prohibiting healthchoice from engaging in the conduct alleged in the complaint 
on december   these cases were removed from state court to the united states district court for the southern district of new york  and plaintiffs have moved to remand these cases to state court 
we are awaiting decisions on these actions 
thomas  et al 
v 
empire  et al 
by a summons dated june  and a complaint dated may   and served upon empire on june   this putative class action was commenced in the united states district court for the southern district of florida  miami division 
in addition to empire  the other named defendants in thomas are the blue cross blue shield association and substantially all of the other blue plans in the country 
the named plaintiffs  drs 
thomas and michael kutell and the connecticut state medical society  bring this case on their own behalf and also purport to bring it on behalf of similarly situated physicians and seek damages and injunctive relief to redress their claim of economic losses which they allege is the result of defendants  on their own and as part of a common scheme  systemically denying  delaying and diminishing claim payments 
more specifically  plaintiffs allege that the defendants deny payment based upon cost or actuarial criteria rather than medical necessity or coverage  improperly downcode and bundle claims  refuse to recognize modifiers  intentionally delay payment by pending otherwise payable claims and through calculated understaffing  use explanation of benefits  or eobs  that fraudulently conceal the true nature of what was processed and paid and  finally  by use of capitation agreements which they allege are structured to frustrate a provider s ability to maximize reimbursement under the capitated agreement 
the plaintiffs allege that the co conspirators include not only the named defendants but also other insurance companies  trade associations and related entities such as milliman and robertson actuarial firm  mckesson claims processing software company  national committee for quality assurance  health insurance association of america  the american association of health plans and the coalition for quality healthcare 
in addition to asserting a claim for declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent future damages  plaintiffs assert several causes of action based upon civil rico and mail fraud 
on august   plaintiffs served an amended complaint  adding several medical societies as additional plaintiffs and a cause of action based upon an assignment of benefits 
on september   defendants  including empire  filed a joint motion to dismiss on various grounds  including failure to state a claim  failure to allege fraud with the requisite particularity  and  with respect to certain plaintiffs  lack of standing 
in october  the action was transferred to district court judge federico moreno  who also presides over shane v 
humana  et al  a class action lawsuit brought against other insurers and hmos on behalf of health care providers nationwide 
the thomas case involves allegations similar to those made in the shane action 

table of contents on october   plaintiffs served their memorandum of law in opposition to defendants joint motion to dismiss 
thereafter  on november   the defendants served their joint reply brief 
no date has been set yet for oral argument on the motion 
solomon  et al 
v 
empire  et al 
by a summons dated december   and a complaint dated november   and served upon empire on december   this putative class action was commenced in the united states district court for the southern district of florida  miami division 
in addition to empire  the other named defendants are the blue cross blue shield association and substantially all other blue plans in the country 
this case is similar to the thomas action  a putative class action brought on behalf of physicians  except that this case is brought on behalf of ancillary providers  such as podiatrists  psychologists  chiropractors and physical therapists 
like the thomas plaintiffs  the solomon plaintiffs allege that the defendants  on their own and as part of a common scheme  systematically deny  delay and diminish payments to these providers 
the plaintiffs allegations are similar to those set forth in thomas but also include an allegation that defendants have subjected plaintiffs claims for reimbursement to stricter scrutiny than claims submitted by medical doctors and doctors of osteopathy 
plaintiffs are seeking compensatory and monetary damages and injunctive relief 
plaintiffs also served a motion seeking to transfer this case to judge moreno  the same judge handling the thomas and other similar litigation  and to consolidate this case with the others 
empire and the other defendants did not object to the transfer but opposed the consolidation 
by an order dated january   the case was transferred to judge moreno  but not consolidated with the other pending actions 
the court  on its own initiative  deemed this action a tag along action to the shane litigation  and ordered the case closed for statistical purposes and placed the matter in a civil suspense file 
although the court s action appears to be driven  at least in part  by administrative considerations  the full implication of this ruling is being analyzed 
the defendants time to appear  answer or otherwise move to dismiss the complaint has been extended to march  other 
we are also party to additional litigation and are  from time to time  named as co defendants in legal actions brought against governmental healthcare bodies 
at present  we are not party to any additional litigation which  if concluded in a manner adverse to us  would have a material adverse impact on us or our business

at december   we eliminated the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets  based on approval of the conversion and continued  current and projected positive taxable income 
as a result of the conversion  wellchoice is a for profit entity and is subject to state and local taxes as well as federal income taxes at the statutory rate of 
table of contents for the year ended december  as of december   we reduced our valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets by million based on continued  current and projected positive taxable income 
the weighted average shares outstanding of  and the effect of dilutive securities for the period january through december  was used to calculate basic and diluted earnings per share amounts 
there were no shares or dilutive securities outstanding prior to november  date of conversion and initial public offering

medical loss ratio represents cost of benefits provided as a percentage of premiums earned 
we present our medical loss ratio  excluding new york city and new york state ppo because these accounts differ from our standard ppo product in that they are hospital only accounts which have lower premiums than accounts with full medical and hospital coverage and are retrospectively rated with a guaranteed administrative service fee 
the lower premiums and the size of these accounts distort our performance when the total medical loss ratios are presented 
administrative expense ratio represents administrative and conversion and ipo expenses as a percentage of premiums earned and administrative service fees 
as presented  our administrative expense ratio does not take into account a significant portion of our activity generated by self funded  or aso  business  which represents approximately of our total members 
therefore  in the following table  we provide the information needed to calculate the administrative expense ratio on a premium equivalent basis because that ratio measures administrative expenses relative to the entire volume of insured and self funded business serviced by us and is commonly used in the health insurance industry to compare operating efficiency among companies 
administrative expense ratio on a premium equivalent basis is calculated by dividing administrative and conversion and ipo expenses by premium equivalents for the relevant periods 
premium equivalents is the sum of premium earned  administrative service fees and the amount of paid claims attributable to our self funded business pursuant to which we provide a range of customer services  including claims administration and billing and membership services 
claims paid for our self funded health business is not our revenue 
the premium equivalents for the years indicated were as follows year ended december  in millions revenue premiums earned administrative service fees claims paid for our self funded health business premium equivalents enrollment as of december  and includes  and  new york state ppo account members who reside in new york state but outside of our service areas 
prior to january   these members were enrolled in the new york blue cross blue shield plan licensed in the area where the members resided and  accordingly  the membership was reported by these plans and not by us 
starting in  in accordance with a change to the contract with new york state under which we administer the entire plan  we began including those members enrolled outside of our service area  and all members were therefore enrolled in  and reported by  healthchoice 
new york state ppo account members who reside in new york state but outside of our service areas are excluded from enrollment totals for all other periods presented

overview we are the largest health insurance company in the state of new york based on total preferred provider organization  or ppo  and health maintenance organization  or hmo  membership  which includes members under our insured and administrative services only  or aso  plans 
we offer managed care and traditional indemnity products to approximately million members 
we have licenses with the blue cross blue shield association which entitle us to the exclusive use of the blue cross and blue shield names and marks in ten counties in the new york city metropolitan area and in six counties in upstate new york  the non exclusive right to use the blue cross and blue shield names and marks in one upstate new york county  the exclusive right to only the blue cross name and mark in seven upstate new york counties and the non exclusive right to only the blue cross name in four upstate new york counties 
we market our products and services using these names and marks in our new york service areas 
we also market our managed care products in counties in new jersey under the wellchoice brand 
we offer our products and services to a broad range of customers  including large groups of more than employees  middle market groups  ranging from to employees  small groups  ranging from two to employees and individuals 
over one million of our members are covered through our national accounts  generally large  multi state companies  including many fortune companies 
our revenue primarily consists of premiums earned and administrative service fees derived from the sale of managed care and traditional indemnity health benefits products to employer groups and individuals 
premiums are derived from insured contracts and administrative service fees are derived from self funded contracts  under 
table of contents which we provide a range of customer services  including claims administration and billing and membership services 
revenue also includes administrative service fees earned under the bluecard program for providing members covered by other blue cross and blue shield plans with access to our network providers  reimbursements under our government contracts with the centers for medicare and medicaid services  or cms  to act as a fiscal intermediary for medicare part a program beneficiaries and a carrier for medicare part b program beneficiaries  and investment income 
our cost of benefits provided expense consists primarily of claims paid and claims in process and pending to physicians  hospitals and other healthcare providers and includes an estimate of amounts incurred but not yet reported 
administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation expenses  commission payments to brokers and other overhead business expenses 
we report our operating results as two business segments commercial managed care and other insurance products and services 
our commercial managed care segment accounted for of our membership as of december  our commercial managed care segment includes group ppo  hmo including medicare choice  epo  and other products principally dental only coverage as well as pos as well as our ppo business under our accounts with new york city and new york state 
our other insurance products and services segment consists of our indemnity and individual products 
our indemnity products include traditional indemnity products and government contracts with cms to act as a fiscal intermediary and carrier 
our individual products include medicare supplemental  state sponsored plans  government mandated individual plans and individual hospital only 
we allocate administrative expenses  investment income and other income  but not assets  to our segments 
except when otherwise specifically stated or where the context requires  all references in this document to our membership include both our insured and aso membership 
our new york city and new york state account members are covered under insured plans 
based upon the higher level of payments we expect to receive from cms as a result of the recently enacted medicare prescription improvement and modernization act  subject to cms approval  we will eliminate the additional premiums required by members of our medicare choice program in rockland and westchester counties  reduce the additional premium required by members in nassau and suffolk counties and increase benefits available to new york city members 
this increase in payments from cms will not have a material impact on operations  as they will either be utilized to provide additional benefits or as a reduction in premiums required by members 
our future results of operations will depend in part on our ability to predict and control health care costs through underwriting criteria  utilization management  product design and negotiation of favorable provider and hospital contracts 
our ability to contain such costs may be adversely affected by changes in utilization rates  demographic characteristics  the regulatory environment  health care practices  inflation  new technologies  clusters of high cost cases  continued consolidation of physician  hospital and other provider groups  acts of terrorism and bioterrorism or other catastrophes  including war  and numerous other factors 
our inability to mitigate any or all of the above listed or other factors may adversely affect our future profitability 
the conversion the conversion has been accounted for as a reorganization using the historical carrying values of healthchoice s assets and liabilities 
immediately following the conversion  healthchoice s unassigned reserves were reclassified to par value of common stock and additional paid capital 
concurrently  healthchoice became a wholly owned subsidiary of wellchoice 
the costs of the conversion were recognized as an expense when incurred 
we started incurring conversion related expenses in when healthchoice first began paying fees and expenses of advisors to the new york state superintendent of insurance  or superintendent  in connection with the new york state department of insurance s consideration of our original draft plan of conversion 
from inception of the conversion process through the completion of our initial public offering in  we incurred conversion and offering expenses of million 

table of contents we have benefited from certain favorable tax attributes over the years 
healthchoice has reported its income for tax purposes using certain beneficial rules afforded blue cross and blue shield plans under section of the internal revenue code  or the code 
among other provisions of the code  these plans were granted a special deduction  the b deduction  for regular tax calculation purposes 
as a result of this deduction  healthchoice incurred no regular tax liability but  in profitable years  paid taxes at the alternative minimum tax rate of 
the b deduction is calculated as the excess of of the incurred claim and claim adjustment expenses for the tax year over adjusted surplus  as defined  but limited to taxable income 
the amount of b deductions utilized in each tax year is accumulated in an adjusted surplus balance 
once the cumulative adjusted surplus balance exceeds the b deduction for the current taxable year  the deduction is eliminated 
during the fourth quarter of  we reevaluated our tax position for financial statement purposes related to healthchoice s ability to utilize the section b deduction and determined that when healthchoice converted to a for profit entity  its ability to utilize the section b deduction was uncertain 
no authority directly addresses whether a conversion transaction will render the b deduction unavailable 
we are aware  however  that the internal revenue service has taken the position related to other blue cross blue shield plans that a conversion could result in the inability of a blue cross blue shield plan to utilize the b deduction 
in light of the absence of governing authority  while we intend to continue to take the deduction on our tax returns for periods after the conversion  we will assume  for financial statement reporting purposes  that the deduction will be disallowed 
accordingly  we have utilized million of regular operating loss carryforwards for financial statement purposes in excess of those utilized for tax purposes 
we have substantial tax loss and credit carryovers 
at december   for income tax purposes  our regular tax loss carryforwards  which expire between and  were approximately million and our alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards  which have no expiration  was approximately million 
in early  we received a ruling from the internal revenue service that our conversion was not viewed as a change in control and therefore did not result in limitations in the use of our net regular tax operating loss carryforwards and alternative minimum tax credits 
however  subsequent sales of shares of our common stock  including sales by the fund and or foundation  could result in such a limitation  which would have an impact on our cash flow 
additional state and local taxes as a result of the conversion  we became a for profit entity and are subject to new york state and local taxes that we were not previously required to pay 
these include premium taxes on most non hmo insured business and sales and use taxes which are recorded as administrative expenses  as well as state and local income taxes 
as a result of the new york state budget legislation enacted in may  which eliminated the net income portion of the new york state franchise tax applicable to our new york accident and health insurance subsidiary  we expect to incur federal  state and local income taxes at the rate of approximately of pre tax net income

prior to january   these members were enrolled in the new york blue cross blue shield plan licensed in the area where the members resided and  accordingly  the membership was reported by these plans and not by us 
beginning january   in accordance with a change to the contract with new york state under which we administer the entire plan  we began including those members enrolled outside of our service area  and all members were therefore enrolled in  and reported by  us 
new york state ppo account members who reside in new york state but outside of our service areas are excluded from enrollment totals for all other periods presented 

table of contents the following table sets forth results of operations for each of our segments for the periods set forth below year ended december  in millions commercial managed care total revenue income from continuing operations before income tax expense medical loss ratio commercial managed care total commercial managed care  excluding new york city and new york state ppo administrative expense ratio other insurance products and services total revenue income from continuing operations before income tax expense medical loss ratio administrative expense ratio we present commercial managed care medical loss ratio  excluding new york city and new york state ppo  because these accounts differ from our standard ppo product in that they are hospital only accounts which have lower premiums than accounts with full medical and hospital coverage and are retrospectively rated with a guaranteed administrative service fee 
the lower premiums and the size of these accounts distort our performance when the total medical loss ratios are presented 
as presented  our administrative expense ratio does not take into account a significant portion of our activity generated by self funded  or aso  business  which represents approximately and of our managed care and other insurance products and services members  respectively 
therefore  in the following table  we provide the information needed to calculate the administrative expense ratio on a premium equivalent basis because that ratio measures administrative expenses relative to the entire volume of insured and self funded business serviced by us and is commonly used in the health insurance industry to compare operating efficiency among companies 
administrative expense ratio on a premium equivalent basis is calculated by dividing administrative and conversion and ipo expenses by premium equivalents for the relevant periods 
premium equivalents is the sum of premium earned  administrative service fees and the amount of paid claims attributable to our self funded business pursuant to which we provide a range of customer services  including claims administration and billing and membership services 
claims paid for our self funded health business is not our revenue 
the premium equivalents for the years indicated were as follows year ended december  in millions commercial managed care premiums earned administrative service fees claims paid for our self funded health business premium equivalent other insurance products and services premiums earned administrative service fees claims paid for our self funded health business premium equivalent

the increase in commercial managed care enrollment was the result of the following enrollment growth of  or  members  in group ppo  epo and other due primarily to a combination of new national account customers in our ppo and epo products and the migration of members enrolled in our indemnity products to our commercial managed care products  and enrollment growth of  or  members  in group hmo primarily related to new small group and middle market customers 
the increase in commercial managed care enrollment was offset by a decline in other insurance product and services enrollment

with respect to the new york city account  for approximately two years  the new york city account has been subject to a competitive bid process in which we have participated  relating to a five year contract 
in october  we agreed to new rates with the new york city account for the period from july  through june  we expect the new york city account to complete the competitive bid process regarding the five year contract  sometime in the first half of the loss of one or both of the new york state and new york city accounts would result in reduced membership and revenue and require us to reduce  reallocate or absorb administrative expenses associated with these accounts

market stabilization pools the new york state community rating law requires insurers and hmos writing small employer groups with less than eligible employees and individual non group business to participate in certain market stabilization pools 
under the community rating law there are two major pools a pool for direct pay and small group contracts excluding medicare supplemental contracts non med supp pool and a pool for medicare supplemental contracts med supp pool 
both pools operate on a calendar year basis 

table of contents for pool years prior to  payments to and from the pools were based on demographic data submitted by insurers 
the non med supp pool also contained a component that reimbursed insurers for a portion of claim costs related to certain specified medical conditions 
effective january   the community rating law was amended 
the community rating law  as amended  changed the pooling mechanism from one based on demographics and specified medical conditions to a method based on the experience for approximately fifty medical markers on medical conditions 
the revised community rating law required that the demographic and specified medical conditions approach be phased out over a four year period 
the revised methodology is complex and  as a result  implementing regulations were not issued until during this period  an interim method to distribute the portion of the pools based on the new methodology for non med supp pool funds was developed for pool years through also during this time  the new york state insurance department determined that the demographic approach was permissible under the law and would continue to be the method used for the med supp pool

our ultimate payment to or receipts from these pools may have a material impact to our financial statements 
as result of the med supp pool distributions received in for med supp pool years  and  our medicare supplemental product loss ratio fell below the minimum medical loss ratio allowed under new york insurance regulations 
as a result  we were required to issue premium refunds totaling million

our payments to ibm for operating our data center and technical help desk will be based upon actual utilization of services billed at the rates established in the agreement 
we estimate that our payments to ibm for operating our data center and technical help desk and providing certain core applications software development will total approximately million over the remaining term of the agreement  which we anticipate to be less than the costs which we would have otherwise incurred had we continued to operate the data center and technical help desk ourselves 
pursuant to the ibm agreement  we have undertaken to work jointly with ibm to enhance and modernize our systems applications 
some of the systems application software development will be performed overseas from ibm s offices in bangalore  india or  in the event this facility becomes unavailable during the life of the agreement  services will be provided from a replacement facility 
these applications include technological enhancements based on the ongoing requirements of our business and solutions developed based upon our specifications 
we will own the software developed by ibm under the agreement  other than the claims payment system described below 
we anticipate that the systems applications will be integrated with a new claims payment system being developed by denovis  a privately held  start up company  in coordination with ibm 
the new claims payment system will be licensed to us when it is completed 
the development of the system has been delayed by denovis and as a result we do not expect the system to be ready for acceptance by us in accordance with its specifications any earlier than an approximate two year delay from the original july date we had agreed upon with ibm in june we do not believe this delay will have any material impact on our operations because our existing claims payment system is adequate to meet our needs 
subject to the successful completion and acceptance of the claims payment system  we will pay million for a perpetual license granted by ibm  which includes custom development fees 
under the agreement with ibm  we are scheduled to pay million of this fee in four equal installments upon the achievement of the following milestones receipt of the production ready claims payment system  installation of the production ready claims payment system  completion of testing of the production ready claims payment system  and our acceptance of the production ready claims payment system 
none of these milestones have been completed and we do not expect any of them to be achieved before the remaining million will be paid one year following the date we accept the claims payment system 
following the expiration of the one year warranty period that begins upon the payment of the final installment  we will pay ibm an annual fee of million for maintenance and support services 
we had agreed to purchase million in modernization and other additional services from ibm including integration services provided by ibm in connection with the claims payment system over a five year period beginning in  with annual target purchase rates through in september  ibm and we agreed to reduce our commitment by million to million and to spread out the annual target purchase rate over a seven year period ending in in addition  we accelerated the repayment of million of price concessions granted under the original contract 
we may defer the purchase of services beyond the target date  provided that to the extent we delay purchases more than one year beyond the target year  the aggregate purchase commitment will be increased by an amount equal to per annum of purchases so delayed 
the amount that we will actually spend for these additional services could be less or greater than the annual target purchase rate 
we expect that our spending on 
table of contents modernization and additional ibm services will continue to be at levels consistent with our overall expectations of administrative expenses as a percentage of premiums earned and administrative service fees 
our outsourcing agreement with ibm contains standard indemnification clauses which reduce the risks associated with a variety of claims and actions  including certain failures of ibm to perform under the agreement 
we have the right to terminate certain services if ibm fails to meet our quality and performance benchmarks and we may terminate our relationship with ibm in its entirety upon the occurrence of material breaches under the agreement  ibm s entrance into the health insurance business  changes of control and certain other events which are damaging to us 
we can terminate the outsourcing agreement without cause after june   or at any time within twelve months following a change of control of wellchoice  provided that we pay ibm a termination fee 
the termination fee includes a lump sum payment which decreases over the life of the agreement 
for any wellchoice termination without cause  the lump sum decreases from million beginning in june to million in january we have the right to pay only a portion of this lump sum payment if we choose not to terminate the entire agreement but only certain discrete portions of ibm s services 
any termination following a change of control of wellchoice requires a similar lump sum payment which decreases over the life of the agreement and which is approximately of the payment described in the previous sentence  although we do not have the similar right to terminate only portions of ibm s services  as allowed with a termination without cause 
in addition  upon termination we must reimburse certain of ibm s costs  subject to reduction to the extent we purchase equipment  assume licenses and leases and hire employees used by ibm to provide the services 
we also have the right to terminate the agreement at no cost within six months following a change of control of ibm 
under the terms of the agreement we cannot perform or engage a third party to perform any of the data center or technical help desk services  or more than of the core applications software development services  outsourced to ibm without the written consent of ibm 
for purposes of completing the contractual commitments table on page of this report  we have included an estimate of all services relating to the data center  technical help desk and core applications software development as well as our purchase commitment related to modernization and other additional services 
other purchase obligations purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty 
regulatory and other developments empire is subject to capital and surplus requirements under the new york insurance laws and the capital and surplus licensure requirements established by the blue cross blue shield association 
each of these standards is based on the naic s rbc model act  which provides for four different levels of regulatory attention depending on the ratio of a company s total adjusted capital defined as the total of its statutory capital  surplus  asset valuation reserve and dividend liability to its risk based capital 
the capital and surplus level required to meet the minimum requirements under the new york insurance laws and blue cross blue shield association licensure requirements applicable to empire is of risk based capital authorized control level 
empire exceeds the new york minimum capital and surplus requirements and the blue cross blue shield association capital and surplus licensure requirements 
capital and surplus requirements for empire healthchoice hmo  inc  our hmo subsidiary which is directly owned by empire  are regulated under a different method set forth in the new york department of health s hmo regulations 
the regulations require that empire healthchoice hmo currently maintain reserves of five percent of its annual premium income 
empire healthchoice hmo  with respect to its operations in new york  meets the financial reserve standards of the new york department of health 
the department of health is 
table of contents currently redrafting its regulations and proposes to increase the required reserves gradually over the next six years to twelve and one half percent of annual premium income 
if that requirement changes it will affect all hmos and we expect we will meet those revised standards 
in november  empire healthchoice hmo received a million capital contribution from empire  which was made in connection with the transfer of our new york hmo business from healthchoice to empire healthchoice hmo during in order to ensure compliance with new york capital and surplus requirements 
empire healthchoice hmo is also licensed in new jersey and there are minimum net worth standards established under new jersey laws and regulations 
empire healthchoice hmo  with respect to its operations in new jersey  meets the minimum net worth standards established under new jersey law 
empire healthchoice hmo is also subject to the blue cross blue shield association capital and surplus licensure requirement which is applicable to empire and satisfies that requirement 
our new jersey operations are not subject to the blue cross blue shield association capital and surplus licensure requirement 
at december   wellchoice insurance of new jersey met the minimum capital and surplus requirements of the new jersey department of banking and insurance 
regulation of financial reserves for insurers and hmos is a frequent topic of legislative and regulatory scrutiny and proposals for change 
it is possible that the method of measuring the adequacy of our financial reserves could change and that could affect our financial condition 
however  any such change is likely to affect all companies in the state 
the ability of our insurance and hmo subsidiaries to pay dividends to us is subject to regulatory requirements  including state insurance laws and health department regulations and regulatory surplus or admitted asset requirements  respectively 
these laws and regulations require the approval of the applicable state insurance department or health regulators in order to pay any proposed dividend over a certain amount 
for example  any proposed dividend to wellchoice from empire  which  together with other dividends paid within the preceding twelve month period  exceeds the lesser of of its surplus to policyholders or of adjusted net investment income will be subject to approval by the new york department of insurance 
the provisions of our blue cross and blue shield licenses also may limit our ability to obtain dividends or other cash payments from our subsidiaries as they require our licensed subsidiaries to retain certain levels of minimum surplus and liquidity 
critical accounting estimates the following is an explanation of our accounting policies considered most significant by management 
these accounting policies require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
such estimates and assumptions could change in the future as more information is known 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
revenue recognition our membership contracts generally have one year terms and are subject to cancellation upon days written notice 
premiums are generally due monthly and are recognized as revenue during the period in which we are obligated to provide services to our members 
we record premiums received prior to such periods as unearned premiums 
we record premiums earned net of an allowance for doubtful accounts 
premiums recorded for groups with retrospectively rated arrangements are based upon the actual and estimated claims experience of these groups 
future adjustments to the claims experience of these groups will result in changes in premium revenue 
our estimated claim experience is based on a number of factors  including prior claims experience 
we continually review theses estimates and adjust them based on actual claims experience 
any changes in these estimates are included in current period results 
funds received from these groups in excess of premiums recorded are reflected as liabilities on our balance sheet 

table of contents we recognize administrative service fees during the period in which the related services are performed 
administrative service fees consist of revenues from the performance of administrative services for self funded contracts  reimbursements from our contracts with cms under which we serve as an intermediary for the medicare part a program and a carrier for the medicare part b program  and fees earned under the bluecard program 
we record the revenue earned under our contracts with cms net of an allowance for an estimate of disallowed expenses 
cost of benefits provided cost of benefits provided includes claims paid  claims in process and pending  and an estimate for unreported claims for charges for healthcare services for enrolled members during the period 
these costs include payments to primary care physicians  specialists  hospitals  pharmacies  outpatient care facilities and the costs associated with administering such care 
costs of benefits are recorded net of pharmacy rebates  coordination of benefits and pool recoveries 
we are required to estimate the total amount of claims that have not been reported or that have been received  but not yet adjudicated  during any accounting period 
these estimates  referred to as unpaid claims on our balance sheet  are recorded as liabilities 
we estimate claim reserves in accordance with actuarial standards of practice promulgated by the actuarial standards board  the committee of the american academy of actuaries that establishes the professional guidelines and standards for actuaries to follow 
a considerable degree of judgment is involved in estimating reserves 
we make assumptions regarding the propriety of using existing claims data as the basis for projecting future payments 
factors we consider include medical cost trends  the mix of products and benefits sold  internal processing changes and the amount of time it took to pay all of the benefits for claims from prior periods 
to the extent the actual amount of these claims is greater than the estimated amount based on our underlying assumptions  these differences would be recorded as additional cost of benefits provided in subsequent accounting periods and our future earnings would be adversely affected 
to the extent the claims experience is less than estimated based on our underlying assumptions  these differences would be recorded as a reduction in cost of benefits provided in subsequent accounting periods 
the unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense shown in our balance sheet as of december  consisted of the following components in millions pending and incurred but not yet reported  or ibnr  claims claim adjustment expense reserve other claim related reserves total as reflected in this table  approximately of the liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense is for pending and ibnr claims 
of the estimate for pending and ibnr claims  approximately is for claims incurred in the most recent three months 
estimates of these three months claims are based on projected per member per month  or pmpm  costs and the actual member counts during this period 
the following table presents the impact on unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense of changes in the annualized cost trend underlying the projected pmpm costs for the most recent three months 
increase decrease in claim cost trend increase decrease in unpaid claim estimate in millions 
table of contents estimates of the remaining pending and ibnr claims for those claims incurred more than three months prior to the reporting date were based on claims actually paid during this period and completion factors developed from historical payment lag patterns 
a completion factor is the ratio of the claims for a given month that are paid to date as of the reporting date to the ultimate amount expected to be paid for that month 
the following shows the impact on unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense of changes in the completion factors used in projecting the ultimate cost for claims incurred over three months prior to the reporting date 
increase decrease in completion factor increase decrease in unpaid claim estimate in millions it should be noted that the dollar amounts shown in the tables above would not necessarily flow directly to income from continuing operations 
in prospectively rated business  we are at risk for negative experience where actual claim costs and other expenses are greater than those expected and benefit from positive experience where claim costs and other expenses are less than those expected 
by contrast  in retrospectively rated business  the customer is at risk 
generally speaking only the portion of the reserve change which affects prospectively rated business impacts income from continuing operations 
at december   approximately of the million of reserve for pending and ibnr claims were held for prospectively rated business 
we believe that the recorded unpaid claim liability is adequate to cover our ultimate liability for unpaid claims as of december  actual claim payments and other items may differ from our estimates 
assuming a hypothetical difference between our december  estimates of unpaid claims and actual claims payable for our prospectively rated business  net income from continuing operations for the year ended december   would increase or decrease by approximately million and earnings per share would increase or decrease by approximately per share 
as shown in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statement  there was million of favorable reserve development in for claims incurred in and prior years 
our revised estimate of the liability on and prior years claims was lower than our original estimate at december  this favorable development was the result of million related to amounts we received with respect to the new york state medicare supplemental stabilization pool for years  and million favorable development of general claim liability  and million amortization of premium deficiency reserve in one of our subsidiaries 
of the million favorable development of general claim liability  million relates to  million to  and million to and prior 
as a result of the million net pool receipts  we distributed approximately million of premium refunds to medicare supplemental contract holders during the fourth quarter of taxes we account for income taxes using the liability method 
accordingly  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to the difference between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax asset to the amount we 
table of contents believe is more likely than not to be realized 
this determination  which requires considerable judgment  is based on a number of assumptions including an estimate of future taxable income 
if future taxable income or other factors are not consistent with our expectations  an adjustment to our deferred tax asset may be required in the future 
any such adjustment would be charged or credited to income in the period such determination was made 
retirement benefits pension benefits we sponsor defined benefit cash balance pension plans for our employees 
as discussed in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  we account for these plans in accordance with financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for pensions fas 
fas requires us to make significant assumptions including estimating the expected return on pension plan assets and the discount rate used to determine the current pension obligation 
changes to these assumptions will affect pension expense 
one important factor in determining our pension expense is the assumption for expected return on plan assets 
as of december   our expected long term rate of return on plan assets was which was reduced from for our expense recognition 
the expected rate of return assumption is determined by taking into account our expectations regarding future rates of return for the investment portfolio  with consideration given to the distribution of investments by asset class and historical rates of return for each class 
a decrease increase in the expected return on plan assets would increase decrease pension expense by approximately million 
we apply this assumed long term rate of return on assets to a calculated value of plan assets  which recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets in a systematic manner over five years 
this produces the expected return on plan assets that we include as a component of pension expense 
each year  the gain or loss from asset performance  which is measured as the difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets for that year  is deferred and recognized in the market related value of assets as increments for each of the five years following the gain or loss 
the net deferral of past asset gains and losses affects the calculated value of plan assets and  ultimately  future pension expense 
our pension plans have million of cumulative unrecognized losses as of the december  measurement date 
generally  these losses are amortized into expense each year on a straight line basis over the remaining expected future working lifetime of active participants currently approximately years  to the extent that such losses exceed of the greater of the projected benefit obligation and the market related value of assets 
the estimated impact to the pension expense as a result of the amortization of these losses is approximately million 
the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year based on our measurement date 
at our last measurement date december   we lowered our discount rate to from as of december  and as of december  
changes in the discount rates over the past three years have resulted in an increase to pension expense from what it otherwise would have been 
the net effect on liabilities attributable to changes in the discount rate  as well as the net effect of other changes in actuarial assumptions and experience  have been deferred and amortized as a component of pension expense in accordance with fas at december   our prepaid benefit cost for the qualified and supplemental pension plans combined was million compared to million at december  the prepaid benefits cost represents the end of period excess of the fair value of plan assets over the benefit obligation plus or minus amounts not yet recognized 
net pension income included as a component of administrative expense was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
for the year ended december   we did not contribute any funding into our cash balance pension plans and based on the current funded status  do not anticipate any contributions during 
table of contents other postretirement benefits we provide most employees certain life  medical  vision and dental benefits upon retirement 
as discussed in note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements we account for these plans in accordance with financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions fas 
in accordance with fas  we use various actuarial assumptions including the discount rate and the expected trend in health care costs to estimate the costs and benefit obligations for our retiree health plan 
at december   we lowered our discount rate to from for our expense recognition 
the assumed health care cost trend rate used in measuring the other benefit obligations was in for all participants under age  for participants in medicare hmos and for participants age and over in indemnity plans  decreasing gradually each year until ultimately leveling out at in at december   our liability for postretirement benefits other than pensions was million compared to million at december  expected future benefit payments with respect to liabilities under these plans can be found in the liquidity and capital resources section of this report 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standard board issued sfas no 
revised  employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits 
this statement amends statements no 
 employers accounting for pensions  no 
 employers accounting for settlements and curtailments of defined benefit pension plans and for termination benefits  and no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
however  the statement does not change the recognition and measurement requirements of those statements 
this statement retains the disclosure requirements contained in sfas no 
 employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits  which it replaces and requires additional disclosure 
additional new disclosure includes actual mix of plan assets by category  a description of investment strategies and policies used  a narrative description of the basis for determining the overall expected long term rate of return on asset assumption and aggregate expected contributions 
on december   the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of  or mma  was signed into law 
the mma introduced a voluntary medicare part d prescription drug benefit and created a new federal subsidy for the sponsors of the postretirement prescription drug benefits that are at least actuarially equivalent to the new medicare part d benefit 
under sfas no 
 accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  sponsors must consider the two new features in measuring the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation apbo and net periodic postretirement benefit cost 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the company made a one time election to defer recognition of the impact on sfas no 
accounting 
any measures of apbo and net periodic postretirement benefit cost in the financial statements and the related footnotes for the year ended december  do not reflect the effects of the mma 
currently  specific authoritative guidance on accounting for the federal subsidy is pending and that guidance when issued could require the company to change previously reported information 
the company does not anticipate that the adoption of sfas will materially affect the financial statements 
investments we classify all of our fixed maturity and marketable equity investments as available for sale and  accordingly  they are carried at fair value 
the fair value of investments in fixed maturities and marketable equity securities are based on quoted market prices 
unrealized gains and losses are reported as a separate component of other comprehensive income  net of deferred income taxes 
the factors used to determine whether unrealized losses are considered other than temporary are the length of time the security has been in an unrealized loss position  the market to book value ratio and other relevant qualitative considerations 
the amortized cost of fixed 
table of contents maturities  including certain trust preferred securities  is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity  which is included in investment income 
amortization of premiums and discounts on collateralized mortgage obligations are adjusted for prepayment patterns using the retrospective method 
investment income is shown net of investment expenses 
the cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method 
when the fair value of an investment is lower than its cost and such a decline is determined to be other than temporary  the cost of the investment is written down to fair value and the amount of the write down is charged to net income as a realized loss 
short term investments are carried at fair value  and consist principally of us treasury bills  commercial paper and money market investments 
we consider securities with maturities greater than three months and less than one year at the date of purchase as short term investments 
the fair value of short term investments is based on quoted market prices 
other long term equity investments include joint ventures and warrants 
joint ventures are accounted for under the equity method 
our warrants are considered derivatives and are carried at fair value 
our warrants are not classified as hedging instruments 
fair values of warrants are determined using the black scholes options valuation model 
changes in the fair values of warrants are recorded as realized gains or losses 
we are subject to state laws and regulations that require diversification of our investment portfolios and limit the amount our insurance company subsidiaries may invest in certain investment categories  such as below investment grade fixed income securities  mortgage loans  real estate and equity investments 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations might cause investments exceeding regulatory limitations to be treated as non admitted assets for purposes of measuring statutory surplus and risk based capital and  in some instances  require the sale of those investments 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our fixed maturity and marketable equity securities are subject to the risk of potential losses from adverse market conditions 
to manage the potential for economic losses  we regularly evaluate certain risks  as well as the appropriateness of the investments  to ensure the portfolio is managed within its risk guidelines 
the result is a portfolio that is well diversified 
our primary risk exposures are changes in market interest rates  credit quality and changes in equity prices 
the market value of our investments varies from time to time depending on economic and market conditions 
our investment portfolio is not significantly concentrated in any particular industry or geographic region 
interest rate risk interest rate risk is defined as the potential for economic losses on fixed rate securities due to an adverse change in market interest rates 
our fixed maturity portfolio consists exclusively of us dollar denominated assets  invested primarily in us government securities  corporate bonds  asset backed bonds and mortgage related securities  all of which represent an exposure to changes in the level of market interest rates 
we manage interest rate risk by maintaining a duration commensurate with our insurance liabilities and policyholders surplus 
further  we do not engage in the use of derivatives to manage interest rate risk 
a hypothetical increase in interest rates of basis points would result in an estimated decrease in the fair value of the fixed income portfolio at december  of approximately million 
credit quality risk credit quality risk is defined as the risk of a credit downgrade to an individual fixed income security and the potential loss attributable to that downgrade 
we manage this risk through our investment policy  which establishes credit quality limitations on the overall portfolio as well as dollar limits for individual issuers 
the result is a well diversified portfolio of fixed income securities  with an average credit rating of approximately aa 

table of contents fixed maturity securities quality distribution the following chart shows the quality distribution of our fixed maturity securities portfolio as of december  and december  at fair value december  percent of total december  percent of total dollars in millions total fixed maturity aaa aa a baa total fixed maturity total fixed maturity corporate securities industrial finance utility asset backed securities other total fixed maturity corporate securities total mortgage related securities mortgage pass through certificates collateralized mortgage obligations total mortgage related securities equity price risk equity price risk for stocks is defined as the potential for economic losses due to an adverse change in equity prices 
equity risk exposure is managed through our investment in an indexed mutual fund 
specifically  we are invested in the ml s p index llc  which is an s p index mutual fund  resulting in a well diversified and liquid portfolio that replicates the risk and performance of the broad us stock market 
we also hold a direct common stock investment in webmd and investments in non redeemable preferred stock of several companies 
our investment in non redeemable preferred stock is managed in conjunction with our fixed maturity portfolio 
we estimate our equity price risk from a hypothetical decline in the s p and the relative effect of that decline in the value of our marketable equity portfolio at december  to be a decrease in fair value of million 
fixed income securities our fixed income strategy is to construct and manage a high quality  diversified portfolio of securities 
additionally  our investment policy establishes minimum quality and diversification requirements resulting in an average credit rating of approximately aa 
the average duration of our portfolio as of december  was years
