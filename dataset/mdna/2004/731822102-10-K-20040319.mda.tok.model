item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of the company s results of operation and financial position should be read in conjunction with its consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
in addition  the certain business factor s described under business should be considered in evaluating the company s outlook 
critical accounting policies in preparing financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
management believes that it consistently applies judgments and estimates and such consistent application results in financial statements and accompanying notes that fairly represent all periods presented 
however  any errors in these judgments and estimates may have a material impact on the company s statement of operations and financial condition 
critical accounting policies  as defined by the securities and exchange commission  are those that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult and subjective judgments and estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the company considers its critical accounting policies to be vendor and trade receivable allowances  valuation of long lived assets and income taxes 
vendor and trade receivable allowances pomeroy maintains allowances for doubtful accounts on both vendor and trade receivables for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers or vendors to make required payments 
the determination of a proper allowance for vendor receivables is based on an ongoing analysis as to the recoverability of the company s vendor receivable portfolio based primarily on account aging 
the determination of a proper allowance for trade receivables is based on an ongoing analysis as to the credit quality and recoverability of the company s trade receivable portfolio 
factors considered are account aging  historical bad debt experience  current economic trends and others 
the analysis is performed on both vendor and trade receivable portfolios 
a separate allowance account is maintained based on each analysis 
valuation of long lived assets long lived assets  including property and equipment  goodwill and other intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in facts and circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
events or changes in facts and circumstances that pomeroy considers as impairment indicators include the following significant underperformance of the company s operating results relative to expected operating results  net book value compared to its market capitalization  significant adverse economic and industry trends  significant decrease in the market value of the asset  significant changes to the asset since the company acquired it  and the extent that the company may use an asset or changes in the manner that the company may use it 
when the company determines that one or more impairment indicators are present for its long lived assets  excluding goodwill  pomeroy compares the carrying amount of the asset to the net future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate 
if the carrying amount of the asset is greater than the net future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate  pomeroy would recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value 
an impairment loss  if any  would be reported in the company s future results of operations 
when the company determines that one or more impairment indicators are present for its goodwill  pomeroy compares its reporting unit s carrying value to its fair value 
the company has two reporting units for goodwill testing which are a products reporting unit and a services reporting unit 
the company has adopted january as the valuation date for the annual testing 
income taxes pomeroy is required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which the company operates 
this process involves estimating the company s actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the company s consolidated balance sheet 
the company must then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent that the company believes recovery is not likely  the company must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent the company establishes a valuation allowance in a period  the company must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
pomeroy has not recorded a valuation allowance to reduce the carrying amount of recorded deferred tax assets representing future deductions  as the company believes it will have sufficient taxable income in the future to realize these deductions 
pomeroy considers future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
in the event pomeroy were to determine that it would not be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would decrease income in the period such determination was made

gross profit margin was in fiscal compared to in fiscal this decrease in gross profit resulted primarily from the decrease in hardware and service margins  but was offset somewhat by the adoption of eitf and somewhat by the higher proportion of service gross margin to total gross margin
