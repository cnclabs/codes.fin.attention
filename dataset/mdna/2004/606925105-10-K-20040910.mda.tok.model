during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company acquired the technology and certain other assets of emanage inc emanage  a privately held company that develops software solutions for e mail archiving  records management and lifecycle management 
the emanage software suite includes a complete records management facility for microsoft s sharepoint portal server 
it extends full records management functionality  including lifecycle management and records security  to the collaborative sharepoint document management environment 
for a further discussion of the acquisition of the technology and certain other assets of emanage  see the section entitled  liquidity and capital resources below 
the company continues to evaluate potential acquisition candidates whose products  technology and expertise or market share would enhance mobius s strategic market position 
the company s total revenues increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal to million in fiscal operating loss in fiscal was million  or of revenues  as compared with operating income of million  or of revenues  in fiscal and million  or of revenues  in fiscal excluding the charges for acquired in process research and development of  in fiscal and  this year  operating income was million  or of revenues  in fiscal and million  or of revenues  in fiscal net loss in fiscal was million  or per share  as compared with net income of million  or per diluted share  in fiscal and million  or per diluted share  in fiscal mobius derives its revenues from product licenses  related annual maintenance and professional services and other 
this year  of total revenues were generated from software licenses  were generated from maintenance and were generated from professional services and other 
software license revenues increased from million in fiscal to million last year to million this year  due to increased licensing of mobius products primarily by existing customers and  to a lesser extent  by new customers of the company 
during the latter part of fiscal  mobius began to market licenses of viewdirect tcm products under the term solution packs 
solution packs combine server and client products designed to address specific customer applications and requirements 
license terms on solution packs are generally five years  compared to the year terms most commonly offered by the company in prior periods 
the company offers extended payment terms to our customers  which we believe enhances the company s competitive position 
however  there are no assurances that the offering of solution packs or extended payment terms will continue to have positive results 
mobius continues to monitor the level of sales that include extended payment terms to manage the use of cash associated with these sales 
additionally  the company recently entered into an arrangement to sell long term installments receivable to general electric capital corporation  which provides enhanced flexibility in offering financing alternatives to our customers and to manage our cash flows 
maintenance revenues increased from million in fiscal to million last year to million this year due primarily to the growth in the amount of licensed software covered by maintenance agreements and increases in the maintenance fees charged by the company  partially offset by a decrease in the rate of maintenance charged on solution packs 
maintenance revenue consists primarily of fees for customer support services and enhancements provided by the company for its products 
during the latter part of fiscal  mobius began to market licenses of viewdirect tcm products under the term solution packs 
historically  mobius has charged primarily of contract value for server product annual maintenance and between and of contract value for client product annual maintenance  with a significant portion of the maintenance contracts covering server products 
beginning in the latter part of fiscal  annual maintenance for new year licenses for server and client products is generally based on of the contract value 
annual maintenance for solution packs  which comprised a significant portion of license revenues in fiscal  is generally based on of contract value 
if solution packs continue to comprise a significant portion of the company s revenues and its customer base remains the same  maintenance revenues could potentially decrease 
professional service and other revenue increased from million in fiscal to million last year and decreased to million this year 
the company s professional services group offers installation and conversion services and  to a lesser extent  business consulting and training to our customers 
a large percentage of the mobius suite of products are generally not difficult to install and do not require significant installation services 
as such  while this line of our business provides a valuable service to our customers  revenues from professional services are not a significant percentage of overall revenue 
the decrease in revenues during fiscal reflects fewer large professional service engagements 
international revenues increased this year to million from million last year 
international revenues were million in fiscal approximately of the increase in international revenues this year was a result of the change in the exchange rates from last year 
the majority of mobius s current international revenues are derived from the direct sales force of its wholly owned subsidiaries 
these subsidiaries also derive revenue in certain geographies through third party agents 
the company s subsidiaries conduct business in the currency of the country in which they operate  exposing mobius to currency fluctuations and currency transaction losses or gains  which are outside of mobius s control 
the company believes that the content management markets in which we operate will experience growth in the near term and that our recent product introductions and the e mail archiving and records management technology acquired will provide additional opportunities for growth 
however  market factors are driving customers to cautiously spend on enterprise software which can result in unpredictability in the timing of orders 
additionally  the sales cycle is long and involves complexity as customers consider a number of factors before committing to purchase enterprise software 
factors considered by customers include product benefits  cost and time of implementation  return on investment  ability to operate with existing and future computer systems and the ability to accommodate increased transaction volume and product reliability 
the company has also noticed a trend whereby there are delays in customers approval processes due to protracted contractual negotiations 
the company is attempting to alleviate the impact of this trend by simplifying some of its contract and financial terms 
however  there are no assurances that the growth in the overall content management market or the success of our newer products  such as workflowdirect tm  viewdirect e mail management  viewdirect contenuity  viewdirect r total content integrator and viewdirect abs  as well as acquired technology  will develop as anticipated 
the company also believes that customers are focusing on purchasing solutions for particular applications that have well defined rates of return  as well as on simplifying their environments to gain access to disparate repositories and content throughout their organization quickly and easily 
to address these purchasing patterns  mobius began to market licenses of viewdirect tcm products under the term solution packs as discussed above during the latter part of fiscal for fiscal  license revenues from solution packs represented almost of total license revenues 
the company anticipates continuing to actively market solution packs during fiscal critical accounting policies and estimates mobius s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon mobius s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates are evaluated on an on going basis 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
management believes that its significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of mobius s consolidated financial statements are influenced by the following critical accounting policies revenue recognition the company recognizes license and maintenance revenue in accordance with the provisions of statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
the company generates license revenues from licensing the rights to use its software products to its customers 
the company also generates maintenance revenues from renewable support and software enhancements and professional service revenues from consulting activities performed for license customers 
revenue from software license contracts includes fees related to licenses with terms generally of  or years 
revenues from software license agreements are recognized upon delivery of the software if evidence of an arrangement exists  pricing is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is probable 
if an acceptance period is required  revenues are recognized upon the earlier of customer acceptance or the expiration of the acceptance period 
the company allocates revenue on software arrangements involving multiple elements to each element based on vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value allocable to each element 
historically  mobius s contracts included a software license and an obligation to provide maintenance 
assuming all other revenue recognition criteria were met  revenue was recognized upon delivery using the residual method in accordance with sop  where the fair value of the undelivered elements was deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee was recognized as revenue 
accordingly  when the company entered into a contract that included both a software license and an obligation to provide maintenance  the maintenance revenue was unbundled from the initial license fee and recognized ratably over the maintenance period  starting from the inception of the software license agreement 
the company determined the portion of the contract price attributable to maintenance which may not necessarily track the allocation between license and maintenance fees set out in the contract using a percentage derived from mobius s pricing structure 
the unbundled portion of such maintenance revenue was classified as deferred revenue  with amounts extending beyond one year reported as non current deferred revenue 
if evidence of the fair value for undelivered elements did not exist  all revenue from the arrangement was deferred until such evidence exists or until all elements are delivered 
beginning in the third quarter of fiscal  the vast majority of the company s software license revenue contracts provide for optional maintenance in the first year  billed separately from the software license arrangement 
accordingly  license revenue is recognized upon delivery of the software under the provisions of sop and sop maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the maintenance period 
the company offers installment contracts to its customers  which provide for payments in installments  generally over periods ranging from to years 
under such contracts  software license revenue reflects the present value of future payments under non cancelable license arrangements 
the company has an established business practice of offering installment contracts to customers and has a history of successfully enforcing original payment terms on these contracts without making concessions 
in addition  the payment obligations are unrelated to product implementation or any other post transaction activity  therefore  revenues from installment contracts are generally recognized in the same manner as those requiring current payment 
in the case of installment contracts  software license revenue includes the present value of future payments 
the discount is recognized as interest income over the term of the arrangement 
the company recently entered into an arrangement to sell long term installments receivable to general electric capital corporation  which provides enhanced flexibility in offering financing alternatives to our customers and to manage our cash flows 
maintenance revenue is generally recognized ratably over the term of the support  typically months 
the unearned portion of maintenance revenue is classified as deferred revenue 
professional service revenue is generally recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
in accordance with this method  revenue from professional service contracts is recognized based on the percentage of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs of the project 
the financial reporting for these contracts depends on estimates  which are regularly assessed and subject to revision as the contract progresses to completion 
when the current estimate of total contract costs indicates that a contract will result in a loss  a provision for the full loss is recognized 
professional service revenue associated with new products is generally deferred until completion of the project and acceptance by the customer 
software development costs statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed  requires the capitalization of certain software development costs once technological feasibility is established 
the capitalized costs are then amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated product life  or on the ratio of current revenues to total projected product revenues  whichever is greater 
the company determines technological feasibility based on the working model method 
the period between establishment of a working model and the general availability of mobius s software has historically been short and  accordingly  software development costs qualifying for capitalization have been insignificant 
as a result  the company has expensed all software development costs 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
sfas no 
requires the use of the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities  and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences  net operating loss carryforwards  and tax credit carryforwards if it is more likely than not that the tax benefits will be realized 
a valuation allowance is established if it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain items from the company s consolidated statement of operations as a percentage of total revenues for the fiscal years indicated years ended june  revenues software license maintenance professional service and other total revenues cost of revenues software license maintenance professional service and other total cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative acquired in process research and development facilities restructuring total operating expenses income loss from operations interest income  net other income expense income loss before income taxes provision for benefit from income taxes net income loss year ended june  compared to year ended june  compared to year ended june  revenues o total revenues increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and increased to million in fiscal domestic revenues increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and decreased to million in fiscal international revenues increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and increased to million in fiscal approximately of the increase in international revenues this year was a result of the change in the exchange rates from last year  while most of the increase in fiscal was due to the effect of the change in the exchange rates from fiscal we believe that the increase in international revenues in fiscal reflects the changes made in senior management and the continued investments in the international area 
the following provides a discussion of the changes in software license revenues  maintenance revenues and professional service and other revenues for the fiscal years ended june   and o software license revenues increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and increased to million in fiscal license revenues increased in fiscal and primarily due to increased licensing of mobius products by existing customers and  to a lesser extent  by new customers of the company 
additionally  during fiscal  license revenue increased due to a nominal improvement in the overall economy and the success of the company s solution packs 
during the latter part of fiscal  mobius began to market licenses of viewdirect tcm products under the term solution packs 
solution packs combine server and client products designed to address specific customer applications and requirements with  generally  license terms of five years 
software license revenues from solution packs represented almost of total license revenues 
o maintenance revenues increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and increased to million in fiscal the increases in maintenance revenues during these years were primarily attributable to the growth in the amount of licensed software covered by maintenance agreements and increases in the maintenance fees charged by the company  offset by a decrease in the rate of maintenance charged on solution packs 
historically  mobius has charged primarily of contract value for server product annual maintenance and between and of contract value for client product annual maintenance  with a significant portion of the maintenance contracts covering server products 
beginning in the latter part of fiscal  annual maintenance for new year licenses for server and client products is generally based on of the contract value 
annual maintenance for solution packs  which comprised a significant portion of license revenues in fiscal  is generally based on of contract value 
if solution packs continue to comprise a significant portion of the company s revenues and its customer base remains the same  maintenance revenues could potentially decrease 
o professional service and other revenues increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and decreased to million in fiscal professional service revenues increased during fiscal as a result of mobius dedicating more resources to the development of the company s professional service business and mobius entering into more professional service arrangements 
professional service revenues for fiscal included approximately  relating to services associated with new products that we had deferred revenue recognition pending acceptance by the customer 
excluding this amount  professional service revenues decreased almost in fiscal the decrease in revenues during fiscal reflects fewer large professional service engagements 
other revenues for all years were not significant 
cost of revenues o cost of software license revenues consists primarily of the cost of royalties and sublicense fees 
the cost of software license revenues were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal  representing  and  respectively  of software license revenues in those years 
the cost of software license revenues is a variable expense related to software license revenues that are subject to third party royalties and sub license fees 
the slight decrease this year is due primarily to a decrease in license revenues for products relating to which mobius pays royalties 
in fiscal  the slight increase was primarily attributable to higher royalties related to increased software license revenues that were subject to third party royalties 
additionally  fiscal included a benefit from negotiating more favorable terms with respect to a royalty agreement 
o cost of maintenance revenues consists primarily of personnel costs related to our customer support group  and to a lesser extent  royalties on third party products 
the cost of maintenance revenues increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and increased to million in fiscal  representing  and  respectively  of maintenance revenues in those years 
in fiscal  the increase in cost of maintenance revenues is primarily attributable to increased staffing and personnel related costs  partially offset by negotiating more favorable terms during fiscal with respect to a royalty agreement 
in fiscal  the increase in cost of maintenance revenues is primarily attributable to increased staffing and personnel related costs 
this increase was partially offset by the increased utilization of customer satisfaction personnel in research and development projects and the classification of the related costs as research and development expense 
o cost of professional service and other revenues consists primarily of personnel and subcontractor costs associated with providing professional services 
the cost of professional service and other revenues increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and decreased to million in fiscal  representing  and respectively  of professional service and other revenues in those years 
in fiscal  the cost of professional service and other revenues increased as the result of mobius entering into more subcontractor arrangements 
the cost of professional service for fiscal included approximately  of costs relating to services associated with new products that we had deferred pending acceptance by the customer 
excluding this amount  the cost of professional service decreased  primarily due to a decrease in third party vendor costs 
the cost of professional service revenue as a percentage of professional service and other revenues has increased due to lower margins on the implementation of newer software 
operating expenses o sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of the cost of personnel associated with the selling and marketing of mobius s products  including salaries  incentive compensation costs  travel and entertainment costs and bad debt expense 
sales and marketing costs also include the cost of branch sales offices  marketing  promotional materials and advertising 
these expenses decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and increased to million for fiscal  representing  and  respectively  of total revenues in those years 
in fiscal  the decrease is primarily attributable to lower personnel costs reflecting lower headcount  lower rent and depreciation costs and lower professional fees  partially offset by increased incentive compensation costs as a result of increased license revenues  and an increase in bad debt expense 
in fiscal  sales and marketing expenses increased slightly due to higher personnel costs reflecting increased headcount  offset by lower depreciation costs  bad debt expense and savings due to modifications in the company s incentive compensation plan 
o research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs attributable to the development of new software products and the enhancement of existing products 
the company employs developers in rye  ny  orlando  fl  and ottawa  canada  and utilizes subcontractors in india and the ukraine 
research and development expenses increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and increased to million for fiscal  representing  and  respectively  of total revenues in those years 
the increase in fiscal is primarily attributable to increased personnel costs arising from the acquisition of the contenuity software and certain other assets of cytura corp 
cytura and increased subcontractor fees 
for a further discussion of the acquisition of the contenuity software and certain other assets of cytura  see the section entitled  liquidity and capital resources below 
the increase in fiscal is primarily attributable to higher headcount and related costs associated with continued development of products  additional quality control resources and personnel added with the acquisition of the contenuity software 
o general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs related to management  accounting  human resources  information technology services  administration and associated overhead costs  as well as fees for professional services  primarily legal and accounting 
general and administrative expenses increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and increased to million in fiscal  representing  and  respectively  of total revenues in those years 
the increase in fiscal and is primarily attributable to higher personnel costs and professional fees primarily due to sarbanes oxley act of requirements  offset by lower depreciation 
o acquired in process research and development expenses relate to the acquisition of the contenuity software and certain other assets of cytura and the technology and certain other assets of emanage 
a portion of the purchase price in each acquisition was allocated to acquired in process research and technology 
since the technological feasibility of the research and development projects had not yet been achieved and mobius believed such projects had no alternative future use  the acquired in process research and development was expensed in the year of acquisition 
as a result  the company recorded a charge of  in fiscal relating to the cytura asset acquisition and  in fiscal relating to the emanage asset acquisition 
valuations prepared using the discounted net cash flow method were utilized to value the acquired in process research and development expenses for both acquisitions 
o facilities restructuring expenses consist of accruals for losses on the company s leases for two of its sales offices 
in connection with management s plan to reduce costs and improve operating efficiencies  the company recorded a facilities restructuring charge of million in fiscal the charge reflected estimated future lease obligations  net of estimated sublease income  for office space the company will no longer utilize 
the company worked with an external real estate consultant to determine the best estimate for the accrual 
during fiscal  the company entered into an agreement with the landlord and the over tenant which released mobius from all of its ongoing obligations under the original terms of the lease effective as of february  accordingly  the company recorded additional expenses of  associated with this new agreement 
in connection with the second sales office  the company recorded a facilities restructuring charge of  in fiscal representing the estimated future lease obligations for office space that the company was subleasing to a third party 
the third party abandoned the space during fiscal and the company believed that it was highly unlikely that it would be able to sublease this space for the remainder of the lease term 
as of june   the company had  remaining in the facilities restructuring accrual  which will be paid in future periods in accordance with the plan provisions 
interest income and other income expense interest income  net of interest expense  was million  million and million in fiscal   and  respectively 
the increase in interest income this year is primarily attributable to increased installments receivable balances  partially offset by lower returns on investment and lower cash balances 
other income expense is comprised of gain on investments and foreign currency transactions 
gain on investments of  and  during the fiscal years and  respectively  was the result of the sale of mobius s investment in intelidata stock 
foreign currency losses were  in fiscal and  in fiscal  compared with gains of  in fiscal provision for benefit from income taxes the tax benefit from income taxes was million effective tax rate of in fiscal  compared to a tax provision of million effective tax rate of in fiscal and million in fiscal effective tax rate of 
the tax provision for fiscal includes a tax benefit of  resulting from the resolution of certain tax matters 
excluding the  tax benefit  the effective tax rate was for the fiscal year the higher effective tax rate for fiscal  excluding the  tax benefit  as compared with fiscal  reflects the inability to benefit from losses of certain foreign subsidiaries and foreign taxes paid in certain jurisdictions for which no us foreign tax credit was available 
the lower effective tax rate this year as compared with last year exclusive of the  tax benefit was primarily due to a decrease in losses of certain foreign subsidiaries for which no tax benefit could be recognized

such stock compensation expense for the four quarters ended june  was    and  respectively 
there was no such expense during fiscal since the entire adjustment was recognized prior to july  the company s quarterly revenues and operating results have varied significantly in the past and are likely to vary substantially from quarter to quarter in the future 
for a further discussion of the factors that could impact quarterly results  see the section entitled factors affecting future performance above 
historically  license revenues typically peak primarily in the fourth fiscal quarter ending june and to a lesser extent in the second fiscal quarter ending december 
these fluctuations are caused primarily by customer purchasing patterns and the company s sales force incentive programs  which recognize and reward sales personnel on the basis of achievement of annual and other periodic performance quotas  as well as by the factors described above 
changes in buying patterns  product mix and sales force incentive programs may alter these historical seasonality patterns 
liquidity and capital resources executive overview since its inception  mobius has funded its operations principally through cash flows from operating activities and  to a lesser extent  equity or bank financings 
as of june   mobius had cash and cash equivalents of million  a decrease of million from million held at june  during fiscal  the company acquired the technology and certain other assets of emanage for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
the decrease in cash of about million  exclusive of the emanage acquisition  was primarily due to an increase in software license installments receivable  partially offset by net cash earnings and cash generated from the exercise of stock options by employees and employee stock purchases 
as of june  and  the company had no bank debt outstanding 
the company believes that its existing cash balances and cash flows expected from future operations will be sufficient to meet the company s capital requirements for at least months 
as discussed in the section entitled  software license installments receivable below  the company has entered into a number of license contracts having extended payment terms 
the company continues to monitor the level of sales that include extended payment terms to manage the use of cash associated with these sales 
the company recently entered into an arrangement to sell long term installments receivable to general electric capital corporation gecc  which provides enhanced flexibility in offering financing alternatives to our customers and to manage our cash flows 
if the level of software license revenues financed by installments receivable continues at the current rate and the company is unable to assign a substantial percentage of such receivables to gecc or other vendor financing firms  the company s cash position is likely to be adversely affected 
net cash provided by operating activities was million and million in fiscal and  respectively  compared with net cash used in operating activities of million during mobius s sources of cash during fiscal were collections of software installments and an increase in deferred revenue  offset by an increase in accounts receivable 
mobius s sources of cash during fiscal were collections of accounts receivable and an increase in deferred revenue  offset by an increase in software license installments and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
mobius s uses of cash during fiscal were increases in software license installments receivable  offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses and deferred income taxes 
software license installments  which increased from million at june  to million at june   represent payments due from customers for license fees that are paid over the term of the installment agreement 
this increase was due to a proportionately greater amount of current license revenues being financed by the company 
for additional information  see the section entitled  software license installments receivable below 
mobius s depreciation and amortization expense adjustment in operating activities decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal due to certain assets becoming fully depreciated 
net accounts receivable increased from million at june  to million at june  net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal  compared to net cash provided by investing activities of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
net cash provided by investing activities for fiscal reflects the sale of marketable securities  partially offset by the purchase of marketable securities and capital expenditures 
the decrease in cash provided by investing activities in fiscal as compared with fiscal was primarily attributable to the decrease in the net proceeds from the sale of marketable securities 
for the years ended june   and  cash of million  million and million  respectively  was used for the purchase of computer equipment  furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements 
net cash provided by financing activities was  and million in fiscal and  respectively  due to the exercise of stock options by employees and employee stock purchases 
in fiscal  net cash used in financing activities was million  primarily due to cash used to repurchase mobius s common stock pursuant to mobius s stock repurchase program  partially offset by cash received for employee stock purchases and stock option exercises 
the company s material obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts consist of its operating leases for its office facilities 
these leases expire on various dates through fiscal and provide for additional payments relating to utility costs 
as of june   the future minimum lease payments for these operating leases are as follows in thousands operating year ended leases june   june   june   june   june   thereafter  total minimum lease payments  in addition to the commitments shown above  the company is committed to make future purchases of goods and services of approximately  in compliance with the leases of the company s corporate headquarters in rye  ny and a sales office in chicago  il  the landlords hold letters of credit issued by two banks totaling in the aggregate  secured by a certificate of deposit and a money market account 
on october  the cytura closing date  the company  through a wholly owned subsidiary  acquired technology the contenuity software and certain other assets of cytura  a privately held company  for an aggregate of approximately million in cash  which was paid from the company s existing cash balances 
in addition  the company assumed capital lease obligations of  and incurred acquisition related expenses of  for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
the contenuity software provides a platform for web site implementation and management  document and digital asset management and content publishing 
additionally  under the terms of the agreement  the company was obligated to pay cytura an additional  within days of the first anniversary of the transaction if the average closing price of the company s common stock for a day period in the thirteen months following the cytura closing date exceeded specified amounts set forth in the agreement 
during the fiscal fourth quarter of  the average closing price of the company s common stock exceeded such specified amount 
accordingly  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company recorded incremental goodwill and a payable to cytura of  under the terms of a revised agreement with cytura  the company made the  payment to cytura in january on april  the emanage closing date  the company  through a wholly owned subsidiary  acquired technology and certain other assets of emanage  a privately held company  for an aggregate of approximately million in cash  which was paid from the company s existing cash balances 
in addition  the company assumed liabilities of  and incurred acquisition related expenses of  for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
emanage develops software solutions for e mail archiving  records management and lifecycle management that enable organizations to manage corporate records at an enterprise level 
in addition  under the terms of the agreement  mobius may be obligated to pay emanage up to an additional million if certain revenue and other operating targets are achieved as of the end of each quarter through june  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  certain targets were met  and  accordingly  the company recorded incremental goodwill and a payable to emanage of  the company continues to evaluate potential acquisition candidates whose products  technology and expertise or market share would enhance mobius s strategic market position 
accounts receivable reserves accounts receivable reserves are provided for potential problem accounts and for the potential that some customers decide to cancel or reduce the number of products covered by maintenance arrangements upon their anniversary but do not always notify mobius in sufficient time to prevent some portion of the annual maintenance billings from being recognized 
mobius specifically identifies problem accounts based on the age of the receivable and through discussions with the customer and mobius s sales representatives 
based on the specific account information and the historical relationship of actual losses to revenues and receivable balances  mobius exercises its judgment as to what portion of the accounts receivable balance requires a reserve 
as of june  and june   approximately and  respectively  of the total accounts receivable reserve balances were related to specific accounts 
to the extent that an account for which a specific reserve was provided is subsequently collected  mobius reduces the reserves in the period of collection 
accounts receivable reserves were  and  at june  and june   respectively 
software license installments receivable as of june   software license installments amounted to million  an increase of compared with the june  balance of million 
this increase reflects a significant increase in licenses of viewdirect tcm products that the company began to market in fiscal under the term solution packs 
solution packs are viewdirect tcm product bundles that offer customers technology solutions through application based licensing with license terms generally of five years 
in marketing our solution packs  the company offers extended payment terms to our customers that meet specified standards of creditworthiness  which we believe enhances the company s competitive position 
software license installments are discounted at a market rate of interest at the date the software license contract revenue is recognized 
the discount is amortized to interest income using the interest method over the term of the financing 
since payments are made over multiple reporting periods  software license installments receivable will fluctuate with the amount of license revenue sold on an installment basis 
the company determines the reserve for software license installments based upon customer specific information  including a credit review of the customer  historical write off experience  the ability of the company to enforce original payment terms and current economic conditions 
no single customer has a balance in excess of of total software license installments  and of the total is comprised of customers with balances under  as of june  and  software license installments reserves were  and  respectively
