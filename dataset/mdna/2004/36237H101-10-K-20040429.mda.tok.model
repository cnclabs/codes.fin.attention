the following presentation of management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements  the accompanying notes and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report 
references to fiscal years refer to the year ended or ending january of that year 
overview g iii designs  manufactures  imports and markets an extensive range of outerwear and sportswear including coats  jackets  pants  skirts and other sportswear items under licensed labels  our own proprietary labels and private retail labels 
our products are distributed through a broad mix of retail partners at a variety of price points 
we sell to approximately  retail customers  primarily in the united states  including most major department stores  mass merchants  and specialty retail stores 
our largest customer is wal mart stores  inc sales to two of wal mart s divisions represented approximately of our net sales in fiscal no other customer represented more than of our net sales in fiscal we operate our business in two segments  licensed apparel and non licensed apparel 
the licensed apparel segment includes sales of apparel brands licensed by us from third parties 
the non licensed apparel segment includes sales of apparel under our own brands and private label brands  as well as commission fee income received on sales that are financed by and shipped directly to our customers 
see note l to our consolidated financial statements for financial information with respect to these segments 
the sale of licensed products has been a key element of our business strategy for many years 
we believe that consumers prefer to buy brands they know and we have continually sought licenses that would increase the portfolio of name brands we can offer through different tiers of retail distribution and at a variety of price points 
as a result  the sale of licensed products accounted for of our net sales in fiscal compared to of our net sales in fiscal and of our net sales in fiscal the significant increase in the percentage of our net sales accounted for by licensed products over the past two years has been primarily the result of an increase in our sales of licensed sports apparel and a shift in fiscal in sales to our largest customer from primarily proprietary branded product to primarily licensed product 
our licensed sports apparel business is comprised of two distinct pieces  our traditional core sports apparel and our fashion and classics sports apparel 
our core sports business is primarily sold at the mass and mid tier retail level and consists principally of outerwear styles utilizing the names and logos of sports teams from the major professional sports leagues and universities throughout the country 
our fashion and classics business is more broadly distributed including numerous specialty stores 
it is composed principally of sportswear and outerwear and is more driven by fashion trends than our core sports business 
while sales of fashion and classics sports apparel is expected to be lower in fiscal than in fiscal  we believe it still represents on ongoing opportunity 
we continue to believe that brand owners will look to consolidate the number of licensees they engage to develop product and they will continue to look for licensees with a successful track record of developing brands 
we are continually entering into discussions with licensors regarding new opportunities 
we believe that we have expanded our product capability offerings within outerwear fabrications and in sportswear design and development 
we also believe that our financial position is a positive factor for licensors when they are choosing a licensee 
two recent significant trends are affecting the apparel industry a desire on the part of retailers to consolidate vendors supplying them and a shift in consumer shopping preferences away from traditional department stores to other mid tier and specialty store venues 
we believe that our broad distribution capabilities help us to respond to the various shifts by consumers between distribution channels 
we also believe that our operational capabilities will enable us to continue to be a vendor of choice for our retail partners 
use of estimates and critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the period 
significant accounting policies employed by us  including the use of estimates  are presented in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and the results of operations  and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our most critical accounting policies  discussed below  pertain to revenue recognition  accounts receivable  inventories and income taxes 
in applying these policies  management must use amounts that are based upon its informed judgments and best estimates 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to customer allowances and discounts  product returns  bad debts and inventories 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
revenue recognition we recognize a sale at the time merchandise is shipped to the customer 
we also act as an agent in brokering sales between our customers and overseas factories 
on these transactions  we recognize commission fee income on the sales that are financed by and shipped directly to our customers 
this income is also recorded at the time the merchandise is shipped 
net sales take into account reserves for returns and allowances 
we estimate the amount of reserves and allowances based on current and historical information and trends 
sales are reported net of returns  discounts and allowances 
discounts  allowances and estimates of future returns are recognized when the related revenues are recognized 
accounts receivable in the normal course of business  we extend credit to our customers based on pre defined credit criteria 
accounts receivable  as shown on our consolidated balance sheet  are net of allowances and anticipated discounts 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligation such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or substantial downgrading of credit sources  a specific reserve for bad debts is recorded against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount reasonably expected to be collected 
for all other customers  an allowance for doubtful accounts is determined through analysis of the aging of accounts receivable at the date of the financial statements  assessments of collectability based on historical trends and an evaluation of the impact of economic conditions 
an allowance for discounts is based on reviews of open invoices where concessions have been extended to customers 
costs associated with allowable deductions for customer advertising expenses are charged to advertising expenses in the selling  general and administrative section of our consolidated statements of income 
costs associated with markdowns and other operational charge backs  net of historical recoveries  are included as a reduction of net sales 
all of these are part of the allowances included in accounts receivable 
we reserve against known charge backs  as well as for an estimate of potential future deductions by customers 
these provisions result from seasonal negotiations with our customers as well as historical deduction trends  net of historical recoveries and the evaluation of current market conditions 
inventories inventories are stated at lower of cost determined by the weighted average method  which approximates the first in  first out method or market 
we continually evaluate the composition of our inventories  assessing slow turning  ongoing product as well as fashion product from prior seasons 
the market value of distressed inventory is based on historical sales trends of our individual product lines  the impact of market trends and economic conditions  and the value of current orders for this type of inventory 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure  together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet

in december  due to rapidly rising costs and losses associated with this facility  as well as the political and economic instability in indonesia  we decided to close our factory in indonesia 
the loss from the factory s operations prior to the closedown and the charge taken in connection with the closing of our facility had a negative effect on our results of operations for fiscal the components of this charge include severance  operating expenses of the subsidiary subsequent to the announcement of the closing  write off of property  plant and equipment  and professional services incurred in closing the factory interest and financing charges  net  were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal this decrease resulted primarily from lower borrowings due to lower inventory levels  as well as due to lower interest rates

in december  the fasb deferred the effective date of fin for certain variable interest entities ie non special purpose entities until the first interim or annual period ending march  the partial adoption of the provisions of fin did not have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial position for the year ended january  and we do not expect that the full adoption of the provisions of fin will have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial position

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk impact of inflation and foreign exchange our results of operations for the periods discussed have not been significantly affected by inflation or foreign currency fluctuation 
we negotiate our purchase orders with foreign manufacturers in united states dollars 
thus  notwithstanding any fluctuation in foreign currencies  our cost for any purchase order is not subject to change after the time the order is placed 
however  if the value of the united states dollar against local currencies were to decrease  manufacturers might increase their united states dollar prices for products 
during this past year we were able to offset some of the weakness in the dollar by shifting our sourcing to other more favorable locations 
we may not always be able to accomplish this in the future 
we believe that inflation has not had a material effect on our costs and net revenues during the past three years
