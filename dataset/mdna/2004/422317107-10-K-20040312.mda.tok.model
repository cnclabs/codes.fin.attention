see note to the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates accounting policies we have identified the accounting policies below as integral to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition our primary source of revenue is television advertising 
other sources include network compensation and other revenues 
advertising revenues and network compensation together represented approximately of our total revenues in each of the years ended december  and advertising revenues 
advertising revenues are recognized net of agency and national representatives commissions and in the period when the commercials are broadcast 
barter and trade revenues are included in advertising revenues and are also recognized when the commercials are broadcast 
see barter and trade transactions below 
network compensation 
eleven of our stations have network compensation agreements with abc  ten have agreements with nbc  and two have agreements with cbs 
in connection with the abc and cbs agreements  revenue is recognized when our stations broadcast specific network television programs based upon a negotiated value for each program 
in connection with the nbc agreements  revenue is recognized on a straight line basis  based upon the cash compensation to be paid to our stations by nbc each year 
unlike the abc and cbs agreements  the nbc network compensation is an annual amount and is not specifically assigned to individual network television programs 
other revenues 
we generate revenue from other sources  which include the following types of transactions and activities i management fees earned from the hearst corporation hearst see note to the consolidated financial statements  ii services revenue from lifetime entertainment services see note to the consolidated financial statements  iii services revenue from the production of commercials for advertising customers or from the production of programs to be sold in syndication  iv rental income pursuant to tower lease agreements with third parties providing for attachment of antennas to our towers  and v other miscellaneous revenues  such as licenses and royalties 
accounts receivable we extend credit based upon our evaluation of a customer s credit worthiness and financial condition 
for certain advertisers  we do not extend credit and require cash payment in advance 
we monitor the collection of receivables and we maintain an allowance for estimated losses based upon the aging of such receivables and specific collection issues that may be identified 
concentration of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is generally limited due to the large number of geographically diverse customers  individually small balances  and short payment terms 
program rights program rights represent the right to air various forms of existing programming 
program rights and the corresponding contractual obligations are recorded when the license period begins and the programs are available for use 
program rights are carried at the lower of unamortized cost or estimated net realizable value 
costs of first run programming are amortized over the license period of the program  which is generally one year 
costs of off network syndicated products  feature films  and cartoons are amortized on the future number of showings on an accelerated basis  contemplating the estimated revenue to be earned per showing  but generally not exceeding five years 
barter and trade transactions barter transactions represent the exchange of commercial air time for programming 
trade transactions represent the exchange of commercial air time for merchandise or services 
barter transactions are generally recorded at the fair market value of the commercial airtime relinquished 
trade transactions are generally recorded at the fair market value of the merchandise or services received 
barter program rights and payables are recorded for barter transactions based upon the availability of the broadcast property 
revenue is recognized on barter and trade transactions when the commercials are broadcast  expenses are recorded when the merchandise or service received is utilized 
intangible assets intangible assets are recorded at cost and include fcc licenses  network affiliations  goodwill  and other intangible assets such as advertiser client base and favorable leases 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
as a result  we no longer amortize goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives fcc licenses  but instead perform a review for impairment annually  or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist 
in connection with the adoption of sfas  amortization expense related to goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles decreased by approximately million annually 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
upon adoption of sfas on january  and again in the fourth quarters of and  we completed an impairment review and found no impairment to the carrying value of goodwill or fcc licenses 
had we used different assumptions in developing our estimates  our reported results may have varied 
we consider the assumptions used in our estimates to be reasonable 
we amortize intangible assets with determinable useful lives over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values 
upon adoption of sfas on january   we determined the remaining useful life of our network affiliation intangible assets to be approximately years and the remaining useful life of our advertiser client base intangible asset to be approximately years 
we amortize favorable lease intangible assets over the respective terms of each lease 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we evaluate the remaining useful life of our intangible assets with determinable lives each reporting period to determine whether events or circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization 
prior to the adoption of sfas on january   we amortized goodwill and intangible assets over periods ranging from three to years 
the recoverability of the carrying values of goodwill and intangible assets was evaluated quarterly to determine if an impairment in value had occurred 
pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets  an impairment in value was considered to have occurred when it had been determined that the undiscounted future operating cash flows generated by the acquired business were not sufficient to recover the carrying value of an intangible asset 
if it had been determined that an impairment in value had occurred  goodwill and intangible assets would have been written down to an amount equivalent to the present value of the estimated undiscounted future operating cash flows to be generated by the acquired business 
as of december   it was determined that there had been no impairment of intangible assets 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized because of differences in the book and tax bases of certain assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates 
sfas also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not  that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
income tax expense was approximately million or of pre tax income in our consolidated statement of income for the year ended december  deferred tax assets were approximately million and deferred tax liabilities were approximately million as of december  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
our estimates of income taxes and the significant items giving rise to the deferred assets and liabilities are set forth in note to the consolidated financial statements 
these estimates reflect our assessment of actual future taxes to be paid on items reflected in the consolidated financial statements  giving consideration to both timing and probability 
actual income taxes could vary from such estimates as a result of future changes in income tax law or reviews by the internal revenue service or other tax authorities 
the deferred tax liability primarily relates to differences between book and tax basis of our fcc licenses 
in accordance with the adoption of sfas on january   we no longer amortize our fcc licenses  but instead test them for impairment annually 
as the tax basis in our fcc licenses continues to amortize  our deferred tax liability will increase over time 
we do not expect the significant portion of our deferred tax liability to reverse over time unless i our fcc licenses become impaired  or ii our fcc licenses are sold for cash  which would typically only occur in connection with the sale of net assets of a station or groups of stations or the entire company 
related party transactions we have management and services agreements as well as a series of other related agreements with hearst 
revenues and expenses recorded by us in connection with such agreements amounted to less than of our total revenues and less than of our total operating expenses in each of the years ended december  and see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on these and other related party transactions 
we believe that the terms of the management and services agreements are reasonable to both parties  however  there can be no assurance that more favorable terms would not be available from third parties 
purchase accounting when allocating the purchase price in a purchase transaction to the acquired assets tangible and intangible and assumed liabilities  it is necessary to develop estimates of fair value 
we utilize the services of an independent valuation consulting firm for the purpose of estimating required fair values 
the specialized tangible assets in use at a broadcasting business are typically valued on the basis of the replacement cost of a new asset less observed depreciation 
the appraisal of other fixed assets  such as furnishings  vehicles  and office machines  is based upon a comparable market approach 
identified intangible assets  including fcc licenses  are valued at estimated fair value 
fcc licenses are valued using a direct approach 
the direct approach measures the economic benefits that the fcc license brings to its holder 
the fair market value of the fcc license is determined by discounting these future benefits utilizing discounted cash flows 
the key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow analysis include initial and subsequent capital costs  network affiliation  vhf or uhf status  market revenue growth and station market share projections  operating profit margins  discount rates and terminal value estimates 
off balance sheet financings and liabilities other than agreements for future barter and program rights not yet available for broadcast as of december   and employment contracts for key employees  all of which are disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements  and contractual commitments and other legal contingencies incurred in the normal course of business  we do not have any off balance sheet financings or liabilities 
other than the hearst argyle capital trust the capital trust  a wholly owned unconsolidated subsidiary trust see note to the consolidated financial statements under reclassifications and new accounting pronouncements  we do not have any majority owned subsidiaries that are not included in the consolidated financial statements  nor do we have any interests in or relationships with any special purpose entities that are not reflected in our consolidated financial statements 
accounting estimates our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to allowances for doubtful accounts  program rights  barter and trade transactions  useful lives of property  plant and equipment  intangible assets  carrying value of investments  accrued liabilities  contingent liabilities  income taxes  pension benefits  and fair value of financial instruments and stock options 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions  which we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
had we used different assumptions in determining our estimates  our reported results may have varied 
the different types of estimates that are required to be made by us in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements vary significantly in the level of subjectivity involved in their determination 
we have identified the estimates below as those which contain a relatively higher level of subjectivity in their determination and therefore could have a more material effect upon our reported results had we used different assumptions 
impairment testing of intangible assets in performing our annual impairment testing of goodwill and fcc licenses  which are both considered to be intangible assets with indefinite useful lives  we must make a significant number of assumptions and estimates in applying a fair value based test 
to assist in this process  we utilize the services of an independent valuation consulting firm 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the assumptions and estimates required under the impairment testing of goodwill and fcc licenses included future market revenue growth  operating profit margins  cash flow multiples  market revenue share  and our weighted average cost of capital  among others 
upon adoption of sfas on january  and again in the fourth quarters of and  we completed an impairment review and found no impairment to the carrying value of goodwill or fcc licenses 
had we utilized either a different valuation technique or different assumptions or estimates  the carrying values of goodwill and fcc licenses as of january   december  and december  may have been different 
we consider the assumptions used in our impairment testing of intangible assets to be reasonable 
investment carrying values we have investments in unconsolidated affiliates  which are accounted for under the equity method if our equity interest is from to  and under the cost method if our equity interest is less than and we do not exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies 
we review the carrying value of investments on an ongoing basis and adjust them to reflect net realizable value  where necessary 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
as part of our analysis and determination of the net realizable value of investments  we must make assumptions and estimates regarding expected future cash flows  which involves assessing the financial results  forecasts  and strategic direction of the investee companies 
in addition  we must make assumptions regarding discount rates  market growth rates  comparable company valuations and other factors  and the types of assumptions we must make differ according to the type of investment to be valued 
had we utilized different assumptions and estimates in our assessment of the net realizable value of investments  the carrying values of our investments as of december  may have been different 
we consider the assumptions used in our determination of investment carrying values to be reasonable 
pension assumptions in computing projected benefit obligations and the resulting pension expense  we are required to make a number of assumptions 
to assist in this process  we use the services of an independent consulting firm 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
to compute our projected benefit obligations as of the measurement date of september   we used the discount rate of and a rate of compensation increase of 
in determining the discount rate assumption of  we used a measurement date of september  and constructed a portfolio of bonds to match the benefit payment stream that is projected to be paid from the company s pension plans 
the benefit payment stream is assumed to be funded from bond coupons and maturities as well as interest on the excess cash flows from the bond portfolio 
to compute our pension expense in the year ended december   we used a discount rate of  an expected long term rate of return on plan assets of  and a rate of compensation increase of 
to determine the discount rate assumption of  we used the measurement date of september  and used the same methodology to construct a portfolio of bonds to match the projected benefit payment 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumption of is based on the weighted average expected long term returns for the target allocation of plan assets as of the measurement date of september  see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion on management s methodology for developing the expected long term rate of return assumption 
in calculating our pension expense for the year ending december   we anticipate using an assumed expected long term rate of return of 
we consider the assumptions used in our determination of our projected benefit obligations and pension expense to be reasonable 
pension assumptions sensitivity analysis the weighted average assumptions used in computing our net pension expense and projected benefit obligation have a significant effect on the amounts reported 
a one percentage point change in each of the assumptions below would have the following effects upon net pension expense benefit and projected benefit obligation  respectively  in the year ended and as of december  one percentage point increase one percentage point decrease discount rate expected long term rate of return rate of compensation increase discount rate expected long term rate of return rate of compensation increase in thousands net pension expense benefit   projected benefit obligation   significant business transactions during the three year period ended december   we were involved in the following significant transactions on march   we exchanged our radio stations in phoenix  arizona ktar am  kmvp am  and kklt fm the phoenix stations for wmur tv  the abc affiliate serving manchester  new hampshire  which is part of the boston  massachusetts television market  in a three party swap the phoenix transaction

see revenue recognition under note to the consolidated financial statements 
total revenues in the year ended december  were million  as compared to million in the year ended december   a decrease of million or 
this net decrease was primarily attributable to the following factors i a decrease in net political advertising revenues of approximately million  as a result of the normal  cyclical nature of political spending on television broadcasting whereby  in which the demand for advertising by candidates running for political office increases in even numbered years such as  ii a decrease in net advertising revenues due to the absence of approximately million in revenue generated in the first quarter of during the broadcast of the winter olympics by our ten nbc affiliates  iii the loss of approximately million in net advertising revenues during march due to advertiser cancellations  schedule adjustments  pre emptions for network news coverage  and lost new bookings  as a result of the commencement of the war in iraq 
these factors were partially offset by an increase in demand by core national local advertisers  particularly in the categories of financial services  automotive  packaged goods  retail  and furniture and housewares 
our net political and olympic advertising revenues are likely to continue to be higher in even numbered years such as  when demand for advertising increases as a result of candidates running for political office and the broadcasting of the olympics

we review  on a continuing basis  the financial statement carrying value of property  plant and equipment for impairment 
if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset carrying value may not be recoverable  the carrying value is written down through accelerated depreciation 
amortization was million in the year ended december   as compared to million in the year ended december   an increase of million  principally resulting from a catch up to amortization related to a separately identified intangible asset  advertiser client base 
in december  we reversed a reclassification we had made in december related to this separately identified intangible asset 
in december  we determined that the advertiser client base should continue to be separately identified from goodwill and  as an intangible asset with a determinable useful life under sfas  be amortized over its estimated useful life 
accordingly  we resumed amortization and recorded a catch up to amortization expense on the advertiser client base of million in the fourth quarter of we expect our depreciation and amortization expense to be approximately million in see note to the consolidated financial statements

 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas is effective for contracts entered into or modified after june   except in certain instances  and for hedging relationships designated after june  in addition  except in those certain instances  all provisions of sfas should be applied prospectively 
since we are not currently involved in any derivative financial instruments  sfas had no effect upon our financial statements in the year ended december  however  we may consider certain derivative strategies in the future 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity sfas 
sfas establishes standards for how a company classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  we have determined that sfas does not affect the classification or measurement of any of our financial instruments 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no

sfas r requires additional disclosures related to the description of plan assets including investment strategies  plan obligations  cash flows and net periodic benefit cost of defined benefit pension and other defined benefit postretirement plans 
effective december   we adopted the disclosure requirements of sfas r with the exception of future expected benefit payments  which becomes effective for us for fiscal years ending after june  or december  in december  the fasb issued fin r  which served to clarify the guidance in financial interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin  and provided additional guidance surrounding the application of fin fin establishes consolidation criteria for entities for which control is not easily discernable under accounting research bulletin  consolidated financial statements  which is based on the premise that holders of an entity control the entity by virtue of voting rights 
fin r provides guidance for identifying the party with a controlling financial interest resulting from arrangements or financial interests rather than from voting interests 
fin established standards for determining the circumstances under which an entity defined as a variable interest entity should be consolidated based upon an evaluation of financial interests and other arrangements rather than voting control 
fin also requires disclosure about any variable interest entities that we are not required to consolidate  but in which we have a significant variable interest 
application of fin r is required for companies that have interests in those entities that are considered to be special purpose entities  beginning in periods ending after december   and application is required for interests in all other types of entities beginning in periods ending after march  we adopted and applied the provisions of fin r as of december  with respect to our wholly owned trust subsidiary  the hearst argyle capital trust hereafter the capital trust  which is considered to be a special purpose entity 
the adoption of fin r required us to de consolidate the capital trust in our financial statements 
in order to present the capital trust as an unconsolidated subsidiary  we adjusted the presentation in our consolidated balance sheets as follows  for all periods presented i reclassified the amount of million  which was previously classified as company obligated redeemable convertible preferred securities of subsidiary trust holding solely parent company debentures to note payable to capital trust  ii presented an investment in the capital trust of million  which is included under investments see note to the consolidated financial statements  and iii presented a long term note payable to the capital trust of million  which is included under note payable to capital trust  bringing the total note payable to capital trust to million see note to the consolidated financial statements 
once the redeemable convertible preferred securities have been redeemed or reached maturity  our investment in the capital trust of million will be offset by our long term note payable to the capital trust of million  resulting in no effect to our consolidated income statement 
in addition  we adjusted the presentation in our consolidated income statements in all periods presented to reclassify the amounts previously recorded as dividends on redeemable convertible preferred securities to interest expense  net capital trust 
these changes required under fin r represent financial statement presentation only and are not a result of any changes to the legal  financial  or operating structure of the capital trust 
with respect to any other entities  such as our managed stations  which could potentially be affected by fin r and for which the application date of fin r is the end of the first quarter of  we are currently evaluating the impact  if any 
although we do not believe the full adoption of fin r will have a material impact on our net income  we cannot make any definitive determination until we complete our evaluation 
in january  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp  accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of fsp  which allowed companies to elect a one time deferral of the recognition of the effects of the medicare prescription drug act in accounting for their plans under sfas and in providing disclosures related to the plan required by sfas r 
the fasb allowed the one time deferral due to the accounting issues raised by the medicare prescription drug act in particular  the accounting for the federal subsidy that is not explicitly addressed in sfas and due to the fact that uncertainties exist as to the direct effects of the medicare prescription drug act and its ancillary effects on plan participants 
for companies electing the one time deferral  such deferral remains in effect until authoritative guidance on the accounting for the federal subsidy is issued  or until certain other events  such as a plan amendment  settlement or curtailment  occur 
we are currently evaluating the effects of the medicare prescription drug act on our other postretirement benefit plan and its participants  and have elected the one time deferral 
our accumulated post retirement benefit obligation and net post retirement benefit cost for does not reflect the effects of the medicare prescription drug act 
additionally  once the specific authoritative guidance on the accounting for the federal subsidy is issued  it could result in a change to previously reported information
