item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for a discussion of our fuel hedging activities 
frequent flyer program all major airlines have developed frequent flyer programs as a way of increasing passenger loyalty 
alaska s mileage plan allows members to earn mileage by flying on alaska  horizon and other participating airlines  and by using the services of non airline partners  which include a credit card partner  telephone companies  hotels  and car rental agencies 
alaska is paid by non airline partners for the miles it credits to member accounts 
with advance notice  alaska has the ability to change the mileage plan terms  conditions  partners  mileage credits  and award levels 
mileage can be redeemed for free or discounted travel and for other travel industry awards 
upon accumulating the necessary mileage  members notify alaska of their award selection 
over of the free flight awards on alaska and horizon are subject to blackout dates and capacity controlled seating 
mileage plan accounts may be deleted after three years of inactivity in that member s account 
as of december  and  alaska estimated that  and  respectively  round trip flight awards were eligible for redemption by mileage plan members who have mileage credits exceeding the  mile free round trip domestic ticket award threshold 
of those eligible awards  alaska estimated that  and  respectively  would ultimately be redeemed 
for the years  and  approximately   and  round trip flight awards were redeemed and flown on alaska and horizon 
those awards represent approximately for  for and for of the total passenger miles flown for each period 
for the years  and  approximately   and  respectively  round trip flight awards were redeemed and flown on airline partners 
for miles earned by flying on alaska and travel partners  the estimated incremental cost of providing free travel awards is recognized as a selling expense and accrued as a liability as miles are accumulated 
the incremental cost does not include a contribution to overhead  aircraft cost  or profit 
alaska also sells mileage credits to non airline partners  such as hotels  car rental agencies  and a credit card company 
alaska defers a majority of the sales proceeds  and recognizes these proceeds as revenue when the award transportation is provided on alaska or other airline 
the deferred proceeds are recognized as passenger revenue for awards issued on 
table of contents alaska and as other revenue net for awards issued on other airlines 
at december  and  the deferred revenue and the total liability for providing free travel on alaska and for estimated payments to partner airlines was million and million  respectively 
other information seasonality and other factors our results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of those for the entire year  because the air transportation business is subject to seasonal fluctuations 
our business is somewhat seasonal 
our operating income is generally lowest during the first and fourth quarters  generally increases in the second quarter and reaches its highest level during the third quarter 
the airline industry is characterized generally by low profit margins and high fixed costs  primarily for personnel  aircraft fuel  debt service and rent 
the expenses of an aircraft flight do not vary significantly with the number of passengers carried and  as a result  a relatively small change in the number of passengers or in pricing has a disproportionate effect on an airline s operating and financial results 
accordingly  a minor shortfall in expected revenue levels could cause a disproportionately negative impact on our operating results 
in addition to passenger loads  factors that could cause our quarterly operating results to vary include the timing and success of our growth plan as we increase flights in existing markets and enter new markets  changes in fuel  security and insurance costs  increases in personnel  marketing  aircraft ownership and other operating expenses to support our anticipated growth  and the timing and amount of maintenance expenditures 
in addition  seasonal variations in traffic  various expenditures and weather affect our operating results from quarter to quarter 
we tend to experience the highest levels of traffic and revenue during the third quarter of each year 
given our high proportion of fixed costs  seasonality can affect our profitability from quarter to quarter 
many of our areas of operations experience inclement weather conditions in the winter  causing increased costs associated with deicing aircraft  canceled flights and accommodating displaced passengers 
due to our geographic area of operations  we can be more susceptible to adverse weather conditions than some of our competitors  who may be better able to spread weather related risks over larger route systems 
the results of operations in the air transportation business have also significantly fluctuated in the past in response to general economic conditions 
in addition  fare initiatives  fluctuations in fuel prices  labor actions and other factors could impact this seasonal pattern 
no material part of our business or that of our subsidiaries is dependent upon a single customer or very few customers 
consequently  the loss of our largest few customers would not have a materially adverse effect upon our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 

table of contents insurance we carry insurance for passenger liability  property damage and hull insurance for damage to our aircraft  in amounts that  in the opinion of management  are adequate 
as a result of the events of september   aviation insurers have significantly reduced the maximum amount of insurance coverage available to commercial air carriers for third party liability for claims resulting from acts of terrorism  war or similar events 
at the same time  they significantly increased the premiums for such coverage as well as for aviation insurance in general 
pursuant to authority granted in the air transportation safety and system stabilization act  the homeland security act of  and the emergency wartime supplemental appropriations act of  the government has offered  and we have accepted  war risk insurance to replace commercial war risk insurance through august  other government matters we have elected to participate in the civil reserve air fleet program  whereby we have agreed to make available to the federal government a certain number of aircraft in the event of a military call up 
the government would reimburse us for the use of such aircraft 
business risks our operations and financial results are subject to various uncertainties  such as global and industry instability  intense competition  volatile fuel prices  a largely unionized labor force  the need to finance large capital expenditures  government regulation  potential aircraft incidents and general economic conditions 
the airline industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid environmental change 
we may be unable to compete effectively against other airlines with greater financial resources or lower operating costs  or to adjust rapidly enough in the event the basis of competition in our markets changes 
the airline industry is highly competitive as to fares  flight frequency  frequent flyer benefits  routes and service 
the industry is particularly susceptible to price discounting because airlines incur only nominal costs to provide service to passengers occupying otherwise unsold seats 
we currently compete with one or more other airlines on substantially all of our routes 
many of these airlines are larger and have significantly greater financial resources and name recognition or lower operating costs than our company 
some of these competitors have chosen from time to time to add service  reduce their fares  or both  in our markets 
we may be unable to compete effectively against other airlines that introduce service or discounted fares in the markets that we serve 
our strategy is to focus on serving a few key markets  including seattle  portland  los angeles and anchorage 
significant portions of our flights occur to and from our seattle hub 
in  this traffic to and from seattle accounted for of traffic 
we believe that concentrating our service offerings in this way allows us to maximize our investment in personnel  aircraft and ground operations  as well as to gain greater advantage from sales and marketing efforts in these 
table of contents regions 
as a result  we remain highly dependent upon our key markets 
our business would be harmed by any circumstances causing a reduction in demand for air transportation in our key markets  such as adverse changes in local economic conditions  negative public perception of a key market and significant price increases linked to increases in airport access costs and fees imposed on passengers 
an increase in competition in our key markets could also cause us to reduce fares or take other competitive measures that harm our operating results 
many airlines  including ours  have marketing alliances with other airlines 
among other things  they share the use of two letter flight designator codes to identify their flights and fares in the computerized reservation systems and permit reciprocity in their frequent flyer programs 
internet distribution arrangements either in conjunction with other airlines or with independent travel websites are also becoming an important means for selling airline travel 
any consolidation or significant alliance activity within the airline industry  or our loss of key alliance or distribution relationships  could result in our competitors having access to increased route networks and resources  which  in turn  would increase the risks of competition described above 
the airline industry  particularly the regional airlines  also faces competition from ground transportation alternatives  such as the bus  train or automobile 
video teleconferencing and other methods of electronic communication may add a new dimension of competition to the industry as business travelers seek lower cost substitutes for air travel 
weakness in the general economy  and in the airline industry in particular  could have an adverse effect on our business 
we believe that airline traffic  including business traffic  is particularly sensitive to changes in economic growth and expectations 
weak economic growth contributed to the airline industry suffering significant losses in  and the first half of during  both us airways and united airlines filed for bankruptcy 
because airlines operating under bankruptcy protection receive increased flexibility to reduce their costs by voiding contracts and renegotiating existing business obligations  current and future airline bankruptcies could have a substantial impact on industry competition 
in the event airlines who have received bankruptcy protection choose to apply some or all of the cost savings they obtain toward reduced fares  bankruptcy by airlines who compete with us may cause us to reduce our fares and result in a substantial reduction in revenue and operating margin 
continued weakness in the airline industry may also result in additional industry consolidation  greater reliance on industry alliances  such as code sharing and frequent flyer reciprocity arrangements  and increased price competition among existing carriers  each of which could dramatically alter the competitive environment in the markets we serve and harm our operating results 
continued weak economic performance in the airline industry may also result in a further reduction in our credit rating and make it more difficult for us to raise capital on economical terms 
any general reduction in airline passenger traffic as a result of a soft economy would harm our business 
we rely heavily on automated systems to operate our business and any failure of these systems could harm our business 
we depend on automated systems to operate our business  including our computerized airline 
table of contents reservation system  our telecommunication systems and our website 
we also issue a substantial number of our tickets to passengers as electronic tickets 
we depend on our computerized reservation system to be able to issue  track and accept these electronic tickets 
in order for our operations to work efficiently  our website and reservation system must be able to accommodate a high volume of traffic and deliver important flight information 
substantial or repeated website  reservations system or telecommunication systems failures could reduce the attractiveness of our services and cause our customers to purchase tickets from another airline 
any disruption in these systems could result in the loss of important data  increase our expenses and generally harm our business 
the september  terrorist attacks negatively impacted our industry and our business and further threatened or actual terrorist attacks  or other hostilities involving the us  may significantly harm our industry and our business in the future 
the terrorist attacks of september  and their aftermath have negatively impacted the airline industry  including our company 
since a substantial portion of airline travel  for both business and leisure  is discretionary  further terrorist activity connected with air travel  or the threat of further terrorist activity  could result in travelers canceling or deferring their plans for air travel and have a material adverse effect on our revenues 
in the fourth quarter of  the temporary shutdown of domestic passenger air travel and reduced demand for air travel led alaska to reduce its flight schedule by approximately and horizon to reduce its flight schedule by approximately 
because a substantial portion of our costs are fixed in the short term  however  we were unable to offset the reduction in customer demand through cost savings  and operating results were harmed to a proportionately greater degree 
additional terrorist attacks  the fear of such attacks or other hostilities involving the us could have a further significant negative impact on the airline industry  including us  and could result in a grounding of commercial air traffic by the faa  significantly reduce passenger traffic and yields due to a potentially dramatic drop in demand for air travel  increase security and insurance costs  increase fuel costs and the volatility of fuel prices  make it more difficult for us to obtain war risk or other insurance  and increase costs from airport shutdowns  flight cancellations and delays resulting from security breaches and perceived safety threats 
if we are unable to meet our cost reduction goals  our results of operations and financial condition may suffer 
we  along with other airlines  have announced aggressive cost reduction goals that are an important part of our business strategy 
the aim of these cost reduction initiatives is to improve our profitability without requiring a substantial increase in current fares and to better position us to be able to grow our business and take advantage of market opportunities 
we believe that we have already implemented initiatives that will reduce our annual operating costs by approximately million and plan on achieving approximately million in additional 
table of contents savings through a combination of additional product and other cost management initiatives  market based wage adjustments  a common health and retirement benefits package for every work group  and work rule changes focusing on greater efficiency in operations 
although we plan to work cooperatively with labor groups and employees to achieve these targets  operating changes are not yet in place to generate this level of cost savings 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to implement changes in our operations sufficient to generate this level of savings  or that if such changes are implemented  that forecasted savings will be achieved 
in the event that we are unable to achieve our cost reduction goals  or our efforts prove less successful than those of our competitors  our results of operations will likely be below our own expectations and may be below those of outside financial analysts  and our financial condition may be harmed 
many of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements 
a failure to negotiate new agreements  or to do so on terms competitive with the labor costs and practices of our competitors  could disrupt our business and increase our costs 
as of december   labor unions represented of alaska s and of horizon s employees 
alaska is currently in negotiations with the international association of machinists and aerospace workers union  which represents its ramp service and stock clerk work group 
labor costs generally are a significant component of our total expenses  comprising of our total operating expenses in each of our different employee groups may require separate collective bargaining agreements  and may make demands that would increase our operating expenses and adversely affect our profitability 
if we were unable to reach agreement on the terms of any collective bargaining agreement with any group of our employees or were to experience widespread employee dissatisfaction  we could be subject to work slowdowns or stoppages 
we could also become subject to protests or picketing by organized labor groups representing our employees 
any of these events would be disruptive to our operations and could harm our business 
in the event any agreement we reach with an organized labor group requires us to pay wages or to incur costs that are materially higher than those we currently pay or we are unable to fully offset such increased costs through fare increases  our expenses would increase and our operating margin would be harmed 
increases in fuel costs would harm our business 
fuel costs constitute a significant portion of our total operating expenses  comprising of total operating expenses for the year ended december  significant increases in fuel costs would harm our financial condition and results of operations 
we estimate that during the year ended december   a one cent increase in the price per gallon of fuel would have increased our fuel expenses by million 
historically  fuel costs have been subject to wide price fluctuations based on geopolitical issues and supply and demand 
fuel availability is also subject to periods of market surplus and shortage and is affected by demand for both home heating oil and gasoline 
because of the effect of these events on the price and availability of fuel  the cost and future availability of fuel cannot be predicted with any degree of certainty 
in the event of a fuel supply shortage  higher fuel prices or the curtailment of scheduled service could result 
some of our competitors may have more leverage in obtaining fuel 
we may be unable to offset increases in the price of fuel through 
table of contents higher fares 
we utilize our fuel hedges as a form of insurance against significant increases in fuel prices 
to hedge our exposure to fuel price fluctuations  we began purchasing hedging instruments  primarily crude oil swaps during at december   we had swap and cap agreements for crude oil contracts in place to hedge approximately of our expected jet fuel requirements 
even with hedges  we are substantially exposed to increases in jet fuel costs 
our insurance costs have increased substantially as a result of the september  terrorist attacks  and further increases in insurance costs would harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
following the september  terrorist attacks  aviation insurers dramatically increased airline insurance premiums and significantly reduced the maximum amount of insurance available to airlines for third party claims resulting from acts of terrorism  war or similar events to million per event and in the aggregate 
in light of this development  under the air transportation safety and stabilization act  the homeland security act of  and the emergency wartime supplemental appropriations act of  the government is currently offering domestic airlines either i third party liability war risk coverage above million  or ii in lieu of commercial war risk insurance  full hull  comprehensive and third party liability war risk coverage 
this coverage provides for the same limits of hull and comprehensive insurance and twice the limits of third party liability insurance carried by the airline on september  aviation insurers could increase their premiums even further in the event of additional terrorist attacks  hijackings  airline accidents or other events adversely affecting the airline industry 
furthermore  the full hull  comprehensive and third party war risk insurance provided by the government is mandated through august   with the possibility of an extension through december  while the government may extend the deadline for when it will stop providing such coverage  we cannot be certain that any extension will occur  or if it does  how long the extension will last 
it is expected that  should the government stop providing such coverage to the airline industry  the premiums charged by aviation insurers for this coverage will be substantially higher than the premiums currently charged by the government 
significant increases in insurance premiums would adversely impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
changes in government regulation imposing additional requirements and restrictions on our operations could increase our operating costs and result in service delays and disruptions 
airlines are subject to extensive regulatory and legal requirements  both domestically and internationally  that involve significant compliance costs 
in the last several years  congress has passed laws  and the dot and the faa have issued regulations  relating to the operation of airlines that have required significant expenditures 
for example  on november   the president signed into law the aviation and transportation security act the security act 
this law federalizes substantially all aspects of civil aviation security and requires  among other things  the implementation of certain security measures by airlines and airports  such as the requirement that all passenger bags be screened for explosives 
funding for airline and airport security under the law is primarily provided by a new per enplanement ticket tax  with authority granted to the tsa to impose additional fees on the air carriers if necessary to cover 
table of contents additional federal aviation security costs 
implementation of the requirements of the security act will result in increased costs for our company and our passengers 
in addition to increased costs  the security measures required to be implemented under the security act  as well as additional security measures issued by the faa  have on occasion resulted in a longer check in process for passengers and caused delays and disruptions in airline service  which has led to customer frustration and may reduce the demand for airline travel 
additional laws  regulations  taxes and airport rates and charges have been proposed from time to time that could significantly increase the cost of airline operations or reduce the demand for air travel 
if adopted  these measures could have the effect of raising ticket prices  reducing revenue and or increasing costs 
our reputation and financial results could be harmed in the event of an airline accident or incident 
an accident or incident involving one of our aircraft  such as the loss of alaska flight off the coast of california in january  could involve a significant loss of life and result in a loss of faith in our airlines by the flying public 
in addition  we could experience significant potential claims from injured passengers and surviving relatives  as well as costs for the repair or replacement of a damaged aircraft and its consequential temporary or permanent loss from service 
airlines are required by the dot to carry liability insurance 
although we believe that we currently maintain liability insurance in amounts and of the type generally consistent with industry practice  the amount of such coverage may not be adequate and we may be forced to bear substantial losses from an accident 
substantial claims resulting from an accident in excess of our related insurance coverage would harm our business and financial results 
moreover  any aircraft accident or incident  even if fully insured and even if it does not involve one of our airlines  could cause a public perception that our airlines or the equipment they fly is less safe or reliable than other transportation alternatives  which would harm our business 
our operations are often affected by factors beyond our control  including traffic congestion at airports  weather conditions and increased security measures  any of which could harm our financial condition and results of operations 
like other airlines  our operations are subject to delays caused by factors beyond our control  including air traffic congestion at airports  adverse weather conditions and increased security measures 
delays frustrate passengers  reduce aircraft utilization and increase costs  all of which in turn affect our profitability 
during periods of fog  snow  rain  freezing rain  storms or other adverse weather conditions  flights may be canceled or significantly delayed 
due to our geographic area of operations  we believe our operations are more susceptible to adverse weather conditions than many of our competitors 
cancellations or delays due to weather conditions  traffic control problems and breaches in security could harm our financial condition and results of operations 
our failure to successfully expand our business could harm our financial condition and results of operations 
a part of our current profitability strategy involves increasing the frequency of flights in markets we currently serve  expanding the number of markets served and increasing flight connection 
table of contents opportunities 
we believe that growth will allow us to achieve additional economies of scale and to manage unit costs 
increasing the number of markets we serve depends on our ability to access suitable airports  facilities and in some cases regulatory approvals in targeted markets 
any condition that would deny  limit or delay access to such airports  facilities or approvals would constrain our ability to grow 
in addition  successful growth depends on our ability to maintain yields and load factors at profitable levels 
inadequate revenues in new markets may require us to revise our current growth strategy 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to successfully expand our existing markets or establish new markets  and the failure to do so could harm our financial condition and results of operations 
if alaska fails to comply with financial covenants  some of its financing agreements may be terminated 
alaska is required to comply with specific financial covenants in certain agreements  primarily its million revolving credit facility 
we cannot ensure that alaska will be able to comply with these covenants or provisions or that these requirements will not limit our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs 
alaska s inability to comply with the required financial maintenance covenants or provisions could result in default under these financing agreements and would result in a cross default under alaska s other financing agreements 
in the event of any such default and our inability to obtain a waiver of the default  all amounts outstanding under the agreements could be declared to be immediately due and payable 
if alaska did not have sufficient available cash to pay all amounts that became due and payable  air group or alaska would have to seek additional debt or equity financing  which may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
if such financing were not available  alaska would have to sell assets in order to obtain the funds required to make accelerated payments or risk its aircraft becoming subject to repossession  which could harm our business 
our business could be harmed if we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel at reasonable costs 
our business is labor intensive  with labor costs representing of our operating expenses for the year ended december  we expect salaries  wages and benefits to increase on a gross basis and that these costs could increase as a percentage of our overall costs  which could harm our business 
we compete against the major us airlines for labor in many highly skilled positions 
if we are unable to hire  train and retain qualified employees at a reasonable cost  or if we lose the services of key personnel we may be unable to grow or sustain our business and our operating results and business prospects could be harmed 
we may also have difficulty replacing management or other key personnel who leave and  therefore  the loss of any of these individuals could harm our business 
we have incurred operating losses in each year since and may incur substantial operating losses in the future 
in addition  our quarterly results can fluctuate substantially 
for the year ended december   air group incurred an operating loss of million 
prior to that  we incurred operating losses of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the inability to achieve or sustain 
table of contents profitability may hinder our ability to honor our existing obligations as they become due  to obtain future equity or debt financing or to do so on economical terms  and to sustain and expand our business 
in addition  our quarterly results can fluctuate substantially due to a variety of factors including seasonal variations in traffic  the timing of various expenditures  and weather 
because expenses of an aircraft flight do not vary significantly with the number of passengers carried  a relatively small change in the number of passengers or in pricing has a disproportionate effect on an airline s operating and financial results 
accordingly  a minor shortfall in expected revenue levels could cause a disproportionately negative impact on our operating results 
due to these factors  as well as other risk factors described in this form k  quarter to quarter comparisons of our results may not be good indicators of our future performance 
in addition  it is possible that in any future quarter our operating results could be below expectations of investors and any published reports or analyses regarding our company 
in that event  the price of air group s common stock could decline  perhaps substantially 
our indebtedness could increase the volatility of earnings and otherwise restrict our activities 
we have and will continue to have for the foreseeable future a significant amount of indebtedness 
due to our high fixed costs  including aircraft lease commitments and debt service  a decrease in revenues results in a disproportionately greater decrease in earnings 
as of december   we had approximately  million of indebtedness outstanding  approximately million of which was secured by flight equipment and real property and approximately million of capital lease obligations 
our outstanding indebtedness could have important consequences 
for example  it could limit our ability to obtain additional financing for funding our growth strategy  capital expenditures  acquisitions  working capital or other purposes  require us to dedicate a material portion of our operating cash flow to fund interest payments on indebtedness  thereby reducing funds available for other purposes  and limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures and reduce our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions  including reacting to any economic slowdown in the airline industry 
in addition  we have an ongoing need to finance new aircraft deliveries  and there is no assurance that such financing will be available to us in sufficient amounts or on acceptable terms 
a downgrade in our corporate credit rating may indicate a decline in our business and in our ability to make interest or principal payments on our outstanding debt 
in  air group s credit ratings were downgraded by both s p and moody s 
on march   the senior implied rating for alaska air group was downgraded from ba to b by moody s with a commensurate reduction in other ratings 
on september   standard poor s announced that it lowered the corporate credit rating from bb to bb with a commensurate reduction in other ratings 
we cannot be assured that our corporate credit ratings will not decline 
table of contents in the future 
if any of our ratings decline  this may indicate a decline in our business and may affect the trading prices  if any  of our common stock or convertible notes and may make additional borrowing more expensive and difficult to obtain

table of contents note a pursuant to item of regulation s k  the company is providing disclosure of the reconciliation of reported non gaap financial measures to their most directly comparable financial measures reported on a gaap basis 
the non gaap financial measures provide management the ability to measure and monitor the company s performance both with and without the cost of aircraft fuel 
as both the cost and availability of aircraft fuel are subject to many economic and political factors beyond the company s control  it is the company s view that the measurement and monitoring of performance without this factor is important 
these non gaap financial measures are also more comparable to financial measures reported to the department of transportation by other major network airlines

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes contained elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
all statements in the following discussion which are not reports of historical information or descriptions of current accounting policies are forward looking statements 
please consider our forward looking statements in light of the risks referred to in this report s introductory cautionary note 
there can be no assurance that actual developments will be those anticipated by us 
actual results could differ materially from those projected as a result of a number of factors  some of which we cannot predict or control 
for a discussion of these factors  see item  business business risks 
general alaska and horizon operate as airlines 
however  their business plans  competition  and economic risks differ substantially 
alaska is a major airline serving primarily alaska  the us west coast  five cities on the us east coast  vancouver  canada  and mexico 
it operates an all jet fleet and its average passenger trip is miles 
horizon is a regional airline serving primarily the pacific northwest  northern california  and western canada 
it operates both jet and turboprop aircraft  and its average passenger trip is miles 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  beginning in  horizon will operate regional jet service branded as frontier jetexpress under an agreement with frontier airlines 
year in review and current events overall  economic conditions in improved slightly over and  resulting in stronger summer demand and higher than expected fourth quarter revenue passenger miles rpms or traffic 
however  industry demand levels  as measured by passenger traffic  remained below pre levels 
in an attempt to mitigate negative impacts on our business resulting from the terrorist attacks of september  and the economic downturn in  and and the first half of  our business strategy focuses on extensive cost reductions and revenue enhancement initiatives involving the review of every aspect of our operations 
we experienced increases in both traffic and available seat miles asms or capacity  however our yields passenger fare divided by distance traveled remained flat at alaska year over year 
our unit costs excluding fuel declined at both alaska and horizon  although fuel prices increased roughly year over year 
we expect capacity to increase for alaska and for horizon in compared to in february  alaska initiated a fare rationalization plan whereby a number of restrictions were eliminated and the gap between the highest and lowest fares was reduced 
the goal of this initiative is to increase customer value and simplify the customer s purchase decision 
in june  alaska met with leaders of its labor unions to begin a dialog over how alaska and its labor groups can work cooperatively to better position the airline for growth and success 
these meetings focused on our desire to achieve a cost structure that enables us to offer customers the services they want at fares they are willing to pay  to earn a reasonable profit  to grow our business and take advantage of opportunities  and to secure the futures of as many of our employees as possible 
to reach these goals  our objective is to reduce our cost per available seat 
table of contents mile excluding fuel to cents by however  this is a goal and should not be viewed as a prediction of future performance 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  in april  the emergency wartime supplemental appropriations act was signed into legislation 
the act includes billion of one time cash payments to air carriers  allocated based on each carrier s share of security fees remitted and carrier fees paid to the transportation security administration since its inception in february additionally  passenger security fees were not imposed by the tsa and carrier fees were not paid during the period june  through september  in may  we received our share of the one time cash grant in the amount of million million for alaska and million for horizon 
in the fourth quarter of  we made a decision to retire three c aircraft when they become due for their scheduled maintenance heavy checks in as a result of this decision  we revised our estimates of the useful lives on these aircraft  which resulted in increased depreciation and amortization of approximately million in the fourth quarter of we expect to record an additional million in results of operations compared with our consolidated net income for was million  or per share  compared with a net loss of million  or per share  in our results include million million for alaska and million for horizon received related to assistance from the government under the emergency wartime supplemental appropriations act

alaska airlines revenues operating revenues increased million  or  during as compared to the same period in for the twelve months ended december   capacity increased and traffic increased as compared to the same period in the capacity increases are primarily due to the addition of service to new cities boston  denver  newark  washington dc  orlando and miami and an increase in service in the pacific northwest  mexico  and canada markets  partially offset by lower capacity in the bay area  arizona and northern alaska 
during  roughly of our asm growth came from expansion in the transcontinental and denver 
table of contents markets 
traffic increases primarily reflect service to new cities and traffic increases in the pacific northwest  mexico and nevada  partially offset by decreases in traffic in the bay area  northern alaska and arizona 
higher traffic resulted in a million  or  increase in passenger revenues 
our passenger load factor rpms divided by asms increased percentage points to during as compared to our yield per passenger mile remained constant compared to due to a combination of longer average stage lengths  fewer business travelers  and continued pricing pressure by low cost carriers  partially offset by an increase in revenue from expired mileage plan accounts 
freight and mail revenues increased million  or  due principally to higher freight and mail volumes attributable to a reduction of security restrictions 
other net revenues increased million  or  due largely to cash received from the sale of miles in our frequent flyer program impacting other revenue currently as a portion is recognized immediately and redemption of miles on partner airlines 
alaska airlines expenses for the twelve months ended december   total operating expenses increased million  or  as compared to the same period in this increase is due largely to a increase in asms combined with higher fuel  maintenance  wages and benefits costs and landing fees and other rentals 
operating expense per asm excluding fuel decreased as compared to the same period in from cents to cents 
explanations of significant period over period changes in the components of operating expenses are as follows wages and benefits increased million  or  during as compared to approximately million of this increase reflects higher benefit costs  mainly increases in pension costs of approximately million and higher health insurance and workers compensation costs 
the remaining million increase reflects scale and step increases  partially offset by a decrease in the number of full time equivalent employees 
in may of  under terms of our union contract  our pilots will receive a wage rate increase 
alaska recorded employee profit sharing of million in  which will be paid in no profit sharing occurred in aircraft fuel increased million  or  due to a increase in the fuel cost per gallon and a increase in fuel gallons consumed 
air group s fuel hedging program resulted in alaska recognizing a million reduction in aircraft fuel expense for hedging gains realized on hedge positions settled during fuel prices remain high and can be volatile 
at december   we have fuel hedge contracts in place to hedge  and of our expected fuel usage in  and  respectively 
aircraft maintenance increased million  or  due to increases in the number of outside airframe and engine checks and other outside repairs and additional depreciation 
table of contents that was recorded following our decision in the fourth quarter to retire three boeing cs in aircraft rent decreased million  or  due to new lease extensions at lower rates  partially offset by five new leases 
other selling expenses and commissions decreased million  or 
this decrease was due principally to lower computer reservation system costs  the elimination of travel agency base commissions and lower mileage plan costs  partially offset by an increase in credit card commissions  advertising costs  and incentive payments made to horizon

landing fees and other rentals increased million  or 
the higher rates reflect modest volume growth and an increase in airports cost of operations  including facility expansion initiatives  and increased costs for security 
we expect landing fees and other rentals to continue to increase as a result of airport facility expansions and increased costs for security 
other expense decreased million  or  primarily reflecting lower expenditures for insurance  supplies  communication services and property taxes  partially offset by increases in expenditures for professional services and per diems 
insurance expense decreases are a reflection of several factors including a million insurance reimbursement received during the latter part of resulting from a clarification of liability related to flight  lower cost coverage from a government aviation war risk insurance program and competitive pressures in the aviation war risk insurance market

financial and statistical data for alaska and horizon are shown in item a discussion of this data follows 
alaska airlines revenues operating revenue increased during as compared to available seat miles increased during each quarter of as compared to due to the addition of service to five cities calgary  boston  denver  newark and miami and due to the negative impact of the terrorist attacks on th quarter capacity 
for the full year  capacity was up while revenue passenger miles increased at a slightly lower rate  resulting in a point decrease in passenger load factor 
in our largest market  southern california  capacity was slightly higher 
table of contents in compared to  and traffic was slightly lower  resulting in a decrease in load factor of points 
capacity and traffic gains experienced in the last two quarters in this market were offset by decreases in the first two quarters 
in our second largest market  anchorage fairbanks to the us mainland  both capacity and traffic increased when compared to  traffic increased at a higher rate than capacity  resulting in an increase in load factor of points for the year 
the average load factor for our newest five cities was better than the system average 
yield per passenger mile was down in each quarter of the year in the first quarter  in the second quarter  in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter 
the decrease in passenger yield was due to a combination of fewer business passengers  a drop off in demand due to the events of september  fare sales offered to stimulate demand  and the sagging economy 
for the full year  yields were down 
the higher traffic combined with the lower yield resulted in a increase in passenger revenue 
freight and mail revenues decreased 
after september  new security measures had a negative impact on our freight and mail volumes  resulting in a negative impact on revenues 
other net revenues increased  largely due to increased revenue from the sale of miles in alaska s frequent flyer program  and redemption of miles on partner airlines 
alaska recognizes revenue for the difference between the funds received for the sale of miles to third parties and the cost of the award redemptions on partner airlines 
alaska airlines expenses excluding fuel  operating expenses grew by million  or  as a result of an increase in asms and a decrease in cost per asm 
the cost per asm excluding fuel increased by during the first nine months of when compared to the same period in  but decreased by in the fourth quarter  primarily due to the impact of the terrorist attacks in explanations of significant year over year changes in the components of operating expenses are as follows wages and benefits increased due to a increase in average wages and benefits per employee and a increase in the number of employees 
the results include a full year of a pilot wage increase  which occurred in june  step increases for union employees  and annual merit raises for management employees 
additionally  benefits expense significantly increased due to increases in defined benefit plan costs and increases in health insurance for all employees 
contracted services increased  primarily due to higher rates for ground handling services and a slightly higher volume of services due to capacity growth 
increased airport security screening costs subsequent to september  also contributed to the increase 
aircraft fuel expense decreased due to a decrease in the cost per gallon of fuel  offset by a increase in gallons consumed 
fuel consumption rate per flight hour decreased slightly by 
the lower fuel prices saved million 

table of contents aircraft maintenance expense increased as a result of more airframe checks in in addition  the results reflect a reduced flight schedule as a result of the september terrorist attacks which resulted in the deferring of certain c checks and heavy checks into other selling expense and commissions consists of credit card commissions  computer reservation systems fees  mileage plan award costs for miles earned by flying on alaska or horizon  advertising expenses and commission expense paid on the sale of tickets 
the decrease in was attributed to decreases in computerized reservation system fees  advertising expense and mileage plan awards  the elimination of travel agent base commissions and the continuing shift to direct sales channels  offset by increases in credit card commissions 
in june  we changed our travel agent commissions program to eliminate base commissions and move to a incentive based program 
in  of air group ticket sales were made through travel agents  versus in in  of the ticket sales were made through alaska s internet web site versus in depreciation and amortization increased in as compared to  primarily due to the addition of eight owned aircraft during the first and second quarters of landing fees and other rentals increased  exceeding the increase in landings  due to higher landing fee and rental rates at airports throughout the system 
the higher rates reflect the airports increased cost of operations due to new security directives and expansion of their facilities 
other expense increased  primarily due to higher expenditures for insurance  flight crew hotels and utilities  partly offset by lower property taxes  recruiting  passenger remuneration  uninsured losses and legal costs 
subsequent to the events of september  we experienced significant increases in hull  liability and war risk insurance rates  and were also subject to surcharges for war risk coverage 
as a result of these increases  alaska incurred million in aircraft insurance expense in  compared to million in horizon air revenues for the year  capacity was up and traffic was up  resulting in a point decrease in passenger load factor 
passenger yields were down in the first quarter  down in the second quarter  down in the third quarter and down in the fourth quarter due to a reduction in business passengers and the economic downturn 
for the full year  yields were down 
the increased traffic combined with the lower yield resulted in a increase in passenger revenue 
freight and mail revenues decreased 
in june  horizon ceased carrying general freight in order to focus on carrying higher yield small packages 
this change  along with the impact of the september terrorist attacks  led to the decline in revenues 
other net revenues increased  primarily due to manufacturer support received as compensation for delays in delivery of crj aircraft 

table of contents horizon air expenses cost per asm decreased as a result of a increase in asms combined with a million  or  decrease in operating expenses  excluding fuel and special charge 
unit costs in were adversely impacted by the capacity reductions that resulted from the september terrorist attacks 
additionally  horizon s expenses in were adversely impacted by the delay in the delivery of crj aircraft from january to july explanations of significant year over year changes in the components of operating expenses are as follows wages and benefits remained constant due to the combination of an increase in average wages and benefits per employee and a reduction in the number of employees 
we recognized a million signing bonus in the fourth quarter of related to a new pilot contract 
excluding that bonus  average wages and benefits were up 
aircraft fuel expense decreased due to a decrease in gallons consumed and a decrease in the cost per gallon of fuel 
the fuel consumption rate per flight hour decreased due to the use of more fuel efficient dash and crj aircraft 
aircraft maintenance expense decreased due to greater use of new aircraft in still under warranty  a decrease in aircraft block hours and higher expenses in related to the phasing out of the fokker f jet aircraft 
aircraft rent increased due to higher rental rates incurred on new dash and crj aircraft rented in and depreciation and amortization expense decreased  largely due to higher depreciation in on fokker f jet aircraft spare parts and airframes  which did not recur in landing fees and other rentals increased due to higher landing fee and rental rates at airports throughout the system 
the higher rates reflect the airports increased cost of operations due to new security directives and expansion of their facilities 
other expense increased  primarily due to higher expenditures for insurance 
subsequent to the events of september  we experienced significant increases in hull  liability and war risk insurance rates  and were also subject to surcharges for war risk coverage 
as a result of those increases  insurance expense for aircraft for horizon in was million  compared to million in the million special charge in recognizes the loss in value of owned fokker f aircraft and related spare parts 
the f s  which are being replaced with more fuel efficient crj regional jets  were completely taken out of service on february  the remaining net book value of these aircraft and related spare parts as of december   was million 

table of contents consolidated nonoperating income expense net nonoperating loss was million in compared to nonoperating income of million in the million decrease was primarily due to us government compensation of million recognized in compared to million in in  alaska and horizon recognized million and million  respectively of us government compensation 
during the third quarter of  the dot completed its review procedures and remitted final compensation payments to alaska and horizon of million and million  respectively 
interest expense  net of capitalized interest  totaled million in  which compares to million in cumulative effect of accounting change effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under this statement  goodwill is no longer amortized  but instead is tested for impairment on a minimum of an annual basis 
during the second quarter of  we completed the first step of our impairment test related to our million of goodwill 
the test was performed using alaska and horizon as separate reporting units 
in the fourth quarter of  we completed the second step of our impairment test and determined that all of our goodwill was impaired 
as a result  we recorded a one time  non cash charge  effective january   of million million alaska and million horizon to write off all of our goodwill 
this charge is reflected as a cumulative effect of accounting change in the consolidated statement of operations for critical accounting estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations 
see note to consolidated financial statements for a description of our significant accounting policies 
critical accounting estimates are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgment and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we have identified the following critical accounting estimates 
we have discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these policies with our audit committee 
mileage plan we have a loyalty program that awards miles to passengers who fly on alaska or horizon and our travel partners 
additionally  we sell miles to third parties  such as our credit card partner  for cash 
in either case  the outstanding miles may be redeemed for travel on alaska  horizon  or any of our alliance partners 
we have an obligation to provide this future travel  therefore  for awards earned by passengers who fly on alaska  horizon or our travel partners  we recognize a liability and the corresponding expense for this future obligation 
for miles sold to third parties  a majority of the sales proceeds are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized when the award transportation is provided 
the deferred proceeds are recognized as passenger revenue when awards are issued on alaska  and as other net revenue for awards issued on other airlines 

table of contents at december   we had approximately billion miles outstanding  resulting in an aggregate liability of million 
the liability is computed based on several assumptions that require significant management judgment to estimate and formulate 
there are uncertainties inherent in estimates  therefore  an incorrect assumption impacts the amount and or timing of revenue recognition or mileage plan expenses 
the most significant assumptions in accounting for the mileage plan are described below 
the number of miles that will not be redeemed for travel members may not reach the mileage threshold necessary for a free ticket and outstanding miles may not always be redeemed for travel 
therefore  based on the number of mileage plan accounts and the miles in the accounts  we estimate how many miles will never be used breakage  and do not record a liability for those miles 
our estimates of breakage consider activity in our members accounts  account balances  and other factors 
we believe our breakage assumptions are reasonable 
a hypothetical change in our estimate of breakage has approximately a million affect on the liability 
however  actual breakage could differ significantly from our estimates given the dynamic nature of the program and our inability to predict our member s future behavior 
the number of miles used per award ie  free ticket we estimate how many miles will be used per award 
if actual miles used are more or less than estimated  we may need to adjust the liability and corresponding expense 
our estimates are based on the current requirements in our mileage plan program and historical redemptions on alaska  horizon or other airlines 
the costs which will be incurred to carry the passenger when the frequent flyer travels on his or her award ticket  incremental costs such as food  fuel and insurance are incurred to carry that passenger 
we estimate what these costs excluding any contribution to overhead and profit will be and accrue a liability 
if the passenger travels on another airline on an award ticket  we often must pay the other airline for carrying the passenger 
the other airline costs are based on negotiated agreements and are often substantially higher than the costs we would incur to carry that passenger 
we estimate how much we will pay to other airlines for future travel awards based on historical redemptions and settlements with other carriers and accrue a liability accordingly 
the costs actually incurred by us or paid to other airlines may be higher or lower than the costs that were estimated and accrued  we may need to adjust our liability and corresponding expense 
redemption on alaska or horizon versus other airlines the cost for alaska or horizon to carry an award passenger is typically lower than the cost we will pay to other airlines 
we estimate the number of awards which will be redeemed on alaska or horizon versus other airlines and accrue the costs on this based on our estimate of historical redemption patterns 
if the number of awards redeemed on other airlines is higher or lower than estimated  we may need to adjust our liability and corresponding expense 
we review all mileage plan estimates each quarter  and change our assumptions if facts and circumstances indicate that a change is necessary 
any such change in assumptions could have a significant effect on our financial position and results of operations 

table of contents pension plans we account for the defined benefit pension plans using sfas no 
 employer s accounting for pensions 
under sfas no 
 pension expense is recognized on an accrual basis over employees approximate service periods 
pension expense calculated under sfas no 
is generally independent of funding decisions or requirements 
we recognized expense for our defined benefit pension plans of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the calculation of pension expense and the corresponding liability requires the use of a number of important assumptions  including the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate 
changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts  and future actual experience can differ from these assumptions 
at december   the fair value of our pension plan assets totaled million 
we anticipate making a cash contribution of approximately million during pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on pension plan assets decreases 
at december   we estimate that the pension plan assets will generate a long term rate of return of 
this rate is equal to the assumed rate of used at december   and was developed by evaluating input from consultants and economists as well as long term inflation assumptions 
we regularly review the actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance investments as considered appropriate 
this expected long term rate of return on plan assets at december  is based on an allocation of us equities and us fixed income securities 
decreasing the expected long term rate of return by from to would increase our estimated pension expense by approximately million 
pension liability and future pension expense increase as the discount rate is reduced 
we discounted future pension obligations using a rate of and at december  and  respectively 
the discount rate is determined based on the current rates earned on high quality long term bonds 
decreasing the discount rate by from to would increase our accumulated benefit obligation at december  by approximately million and increase estimated pension expense by approximately million 
future changes in plan asset returns  assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the participants in our pension plans will impact our future pension expense and liabilities 
we cannot predict what these factors will be in the future 
long lived assets as of december   we had approximately billion of property and equipment and related assets 
in accounting for these long lived assets  we make estimates about the expected useful lives of the assets  the expected residual values of the assets  and the potential for impairment based on the fair value of the assets and the cash flows they generate 
factors indicating potential impairment include  but are not limited to  significant decreases in the market value of the long lived assets  a significant change in the long lived assets condition  and operating cash flow losses associated with the use of the long lived asset 
due to the events of september and the impact on the airline industry  in we evaluated whether the book 
table of contents value of our aircraft was impaired in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
we performed an impairment test  as required by sfas no 
 which was based on the estimated future undiscounted cash flows to be generated by our aircraft 
based on this test  we determined that the horizon fokker f fleet was impaired  and a write down of million was taken against the book value of those aircraft and related spare parts 
in and  due to volatile economic conditions and indications of declining aircraft market values  we evaluated whether the book value of our aircraft was impaired in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement supercedes sfas no 
no impairment was necessary based on the results of the evaluations 
there is inherent risk in estimating the future cash flows used in the impairment test 
if cash flows do not materialize as estimated  there is a risk the impairment charges recognized to date may be inaccurate  or further impairment charges may be necessary in the future

table of contents our million credit facility expires and is due in december management is considering various alternatives including renewing or replacing the credit facility although there can be no assurance that this can be accomplished on acceptable terms to the company 
management also intends to make funding payments to our defined benefit plans during totaling million 
our credit facility and certain loan agreements contain provisions that require maintenance of specific levels of net worth  leverage and fixed charge coverage  and limit investments  lease obligations  sales of assets  and additional indebtedness 
at december   we were in compliance with all loan provisions 
new accounting standards in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin  as amended by fin revised in december  requires consolidation of certain types of entities in which the company absorbs a majority of the entity s expected losses  receives a majority of the entity s expected returns  or both  as a result of ownership  contractual or other financial interests in the entity 
these entities are called variable interest entities 
the principal characteristics of variable interest entities are an insufficient amount of equity to absorb the entity s expected losses  equity owners as a group are not able to make decisions about the entity s activities  and equity that does not absorb the entity s losses or receive the entity s residual returns 
variable interests are contractual  ownership or other monetary interests in an entity that change with fluctuations in the entity s net asset value 
as a result  variable interest entities can arise from items such as lease agreements  loan arrangements  guarantees or service contracts 
if an entity is determined to be a variable interest entity  the entity must be consolidated by the primary beneficiary 
the primary beneficiary is the holder of the variable interests that absorbs a majority of the variable interest entity s expected losses or receives a majority of the entity s residual returns in the event no holder has a majority of the expected losses 
there is no primary beneficiary in cases where no single holder absorbs the majority of the expected losses or receives a majority of the residual returns 
the determination of the primary beneficiary is based on qualitative aspects of the arrangements involved or projected cash flows at the inception of the transaction with the variable interests entity 
fin is applicable to financial statements of companies that have interests in special purpose entities  as defined  during the year ended we are the lessee in a series of operating leases covering our leased aircraft 
in many instances  the lessors are trusts established by a third party specifically to purchase  finance and lease aircraft to us 
these leasing entities meet the criteria for variable interest entities 
however  they do not meet the consolidation requirements of fin because we are not the primary beneficiary of the entity s expected gains or losses 
our conclusions are based on the fact that the leasing arrangements involved contain terms which are consistent with market terms at the inception of the lease and do not include residual value guarantees made by us  fixed price purchase obligations or similar features that obligate us to absorb the majority of expected losses of the 
table of contents variable interest entities 
our maximum exposure under these types of lease arrangements is the remaining lease payments  which are reflected in future lease commitments in note plus the cost  if any  of bringing the equipment into compliance with the physical condition required for return 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
sfas no 
amends the transition and disclosure provisions of sfas no 
sfas no 
allowed companies adopting the fair value based method of sfas no 
to utilize one of three alternative transition methods as long as sfas no 
was adopted in a fiscal year beginning prior to december  to date  the company has not adopted sfas no 
and would therefore be required to use on of two methods proscribed by sfas no 
if it adopted sfas no 
in the future 
the fasb currently is working on a project to develop a new standard for accounting for stock based compensation and expects to issue a final standard in the second half of in september  the accounting standards executive committee of the american institute of certified public accountants released a draft statement of position entitled accounting for certain costs and activities related to property  plant  and equipment draft sop 
the draft sop  which is expected to be issued in its final form in first quarter  would become effective for the company january  the primary areas of applicability of the draft sop to the company are in the areas of planned major maintenance activities airframe and engine overhauls and component accounting 
as discussed in property  equipment and depreciation  the company currently capitalizes costs related to major airframe and engine overhauls and amortizes those costs to maintenance expense over the shorter of the life of the overhaul or the remaining lease term 
in the draft sop  these costs would be considered a planned major maintenance activities and  as such  would be expensed as incurred 
effect of inflation inflation and price changes other than for aircraft fuel do not have a significant effect on our operating revenues  operating expenses and operating income 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we have interest rate risk in our floating rate debt obligations and our available for sale marketable investment portfolio  and commodity price risk in jet fuel required to operate our aircraft fleet 
we purchase jet fuel at prevailing market prices  and seek to manage market risk through execution of a documented hedging strategy 
we have market sensitive instruments in the form of fixed rate debt instruments and financial derivative instruments used to hedge our exposure to jet fuel price increases 
we do not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
fuel hedging we utilize our fuel hedges as a form of insurance against significant increases in fuel prices 
we believe there is significant risk in not hedging against the possibility of such fuel price increases 
at december   we had fuel hedge contracts in place to hedge million gallons of our expected jet fuel usage in  million gallons in and million gallons in this 
table of contents represents  and of our anticipated fuel consumption in  and  respectively 
prices of these agreements range from to per barrel 
a hypothetical increase in jet fuel prices would increase fuel expense by approximately million 
a hypothetical decrease in jet fuel prices would decrease fuel expense by approximately million 
this analysis includes the effect of the fuel hedging contracts in place at december  currently  a one cent change in the fuel price per gallon affects annual fuel costs by approximately million 
we utilize financial derivative instruments as hedges to decrease our exposure to jet fuel price changes 
we account for our fuel hedge derivative instruments as cash flow hedges as defined by sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended 
all changes in fair value that are considered to be effective hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss until the underlying jet fuel is consumed 
as of december  and  the fair values of our fuel hedge positions were million and million  respectively 
all of the fair value amounts and million of the fair value amounts are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets 
the remaining fair value amount of million is reflected in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets 
during and  we recognized million and million  respectively  in realized hedging gains 
these amounts are reflected in aircraft fuel in our consolidated statements of operations 
hedge ineffectiveness resulted in nonoperating expense of million for  nonoperating income of million for and nonoperating income of million for these amounts are recorded as non operating income expense in other net in our consolidated statements of operations 
in and  we recorded a net gain of million and a net loss of million  net of tax  in other comprehensive income loss 
these amounts include the change in effectiveness as related to the change in fair market value for future derivative hedge instruments and the removal of the effective portion of derivative hedge instruments that matured during and financial market risk we have exposure to market risk associated with changes in interest rates related primarily to our debt obligations and short term investment portfolio 
our debt obligations include variable rates  which have exposure to changes in interest rates 
a hypothetical change in the average interest rates incurred on variable rate debt during would correspondingly change our net earnings and cash flows associated with these items by approximately million 
during  we issued million million in the second quarter of  million in the third quarter of  and million in the fourth quarter of of debt secured by flight equipment  having interest rates that vary with libor and payment terms ranging from to years 

table of contents on march   we completed the private placement of million of floating rate senior convertible notes due in net proceeds from the offering were million  of which million is restricted to fund interest payments for the first three years and is reported as restricted cash million recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets and million in other assets in the company s consolidated balance sheet as of december  see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of this offering transaction 
we also have investments in marketable securities  which are exposed to market risk associated with changes in interest rates 
if short term interest rates were to average more than they did in  interest income would increase by basis points
