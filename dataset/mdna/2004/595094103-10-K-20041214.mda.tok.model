overview micromuse inc develops  markets and supports a family of scalable  highly configurable  rapidly deployable software solutions that enable fault management and service assurance the effective monitoring and 
table of contents management of multiple elements underlying an information technology infrastructure  including network devices  computing systems and applications  and the mapping of these elements to the business services they impact 
the company was founded in and subsequently developed our netcool omnibus software  which we began shipping in january the company continues to develop and enhance our netcool family of products with more than new products  product enhancements and integrations occurring during the fiscal year ended september  all of our revenues continue to be derived from licenses for our netcool family of products and related maintenance  training and consulting services 
we currently expect that netcool related revenues will continue to account for all or substantially all of our revenues for the foreseeable future 
as a result  our future operating results are dependent upon continued market acceptance of our netcool products and enhancements thereto 
as of september   we had licensed our netcool products to approximately  customers worldwide in comparison to approximately  customers in fiscal year this increase reflects the continued growth in customers in the enterprise sector  which generated of total revenue in the fiscal year ended september   compared with in the fiscal year ended september  and new customer growth in emerging geographical markets 
we license our software through our direct sales force  oems and value added resellers 
revenues from oems and resellers combined accounted for approximately  and of our total license revenues for fiscal  and  respectively 
our ability to achieve significant additional revenue growth in the future will depend substantially on our success in recruiting and training sufficient sales and technical services personnel  maintaining our current distribution relationships and establishing additional relationships with oems  resellers and systems integrators 
revenue increased by million or in fiscal compared to fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to the growth of revenues in certain international markets which increased by compared to fiscal  as well as due to an increasing impact of the economic recovery and a return to stability in the telecommunications sector 
the decrease in revenue in fiscal and was primarily attributable to the economic slowdown that limited the overall capital spending of existing and potential customers especially in the telecommunications market 
our ability to achieve significant additional revenue growth and increased profitability in the future will depend substantially on our success in establishing an appropriate strategy to meet ongoing general economic and individual market conditions  increased diversification across market sectors  and increased market penetration in emerging growth markets such as central and eastern europe and the asia pacific region 
operating expenses in fiscal increased by million or compared to fiscal this increase was caused primarily by professional fees and costs of million relating to the restatement described above under restatement of financial statements in this section 
this increase also includes million of additional professional service fees associated with pending litigation not associated with the restatement in fiscal as compared to fiscal and a million increase in g a  offset by a million decrease in restructuring costs 
operating expenses in fiscal decreased from fiscal primarily due to reductions in headcount 
we expect significant expenses for professional fees to continue during fiscal and perhaps beyond due to pending litigation 
we currently estimate that professional service fees associated with pending litigation will be in the range of million to million during fiscal actual fees incurred may be higher or lower depending on many factors beyond our control 
see part i  item legal proceedings for additional information on current legal proceedings 
we also expect significant increases in operating expenses related to the implementation of the internal control requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act of section 
we currently estimate that professional service fees associated with the implementation of section will be in the range of million to million during fiscal as a result of our multinational operations and sales  our operating results are subject to significant fluctuations based upon changes in the exchange rates of certain currencies  particularly the british pound  in relation to the us dollar 
for example  while our united states headquarters is located in san francisco  
table of contents california  our principal product development operations are located in london  england 
as a result  a substantial portion of our costs and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
the increase in revenue in fiscal was impacted positively by exchange rates  primarily the strengthening british pound  by approximately million 
this was offset by the impact of the same exchange rates on expenses  with the net impact in fiscal being insignificant to the operations 
for the fiscal years ended september   and  license  maintenance and service revenues from customers located outside of the united states accounted for  and of our total revenues  respectively 
see note geographic and segment information of notes to consolidated financial statements 
although we will continue to monitor our exposure to currency fluctuations  there can be no assurance that exchange rate fluctuations will not have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including  but not limited to  revenue recognition  bad debts  intangible assets  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following are the critical accounting policies and estimates that are used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
our revenues are derived from license revenues for our netcool family of products  as well as associated maintenance  consulting and training services revenues 
we recognize revenue in accordance with statement of position  software revenue recognition sop  as amended by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions sop  and recognize revenue using the residual method 
under the residual method  revenue is recognized when vendor specific objective evidence of fair value exists for all of the undelivered elements in the arrangement ie  maintenance and professional services  but does not exist for one or more of the delivered elements in the arrangement ie  the software product 
we allocate revenue to each undelivered element based on its respective fair value  with the fair value determined by the price charged when that element is sold separately 
we determine the fair value of the maintenance portion of the arrangement based on the renewal price charged to the customer when maintenance is sold separately or the option price for annual maintenance renewals included in the underlying customer contracts 
the fair value of the professional services portion of the arrangement is based on the hourly rates that we charge for these services when sold independently from a software license 
if evidence of fair value cannot be established for the undelivered elements of a license agreement  the entire amount of revenue from the arrangement is deferred and recognized ratably over the period that these elements are delivered 
for all of our software arrangements  we defer revenue for the fair value of the undelivered elements and recognize revenue for the delivered elements when the basic criteria of sop have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the vendor s fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
we evaluate each as follows persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists for license arrangements with end users  an arrangement is evidenced by a written contract  which is signed by both the customer and the company  or a purchase order from those customers who have previously negotiated a standard license arrangement with us 
sales to our resellers are evidenced by a master agreement governing the 
table of contents relationship together with a purchase order on a transaction by transaction basis 
for certain of our oem arrangements  an arrangement is evidenced on receipt of a delivery notification to the end user 
further  in the case of arrangements with resellers and oems  evidence of sell through to an end user is required as additional evidence that the arrangement exists 
evidence of sell through usually comes in the form of a purchase order or contract identifying the end user and sell through shipping reports  identifying the ship to location 
delivery has occurred delivery to both our direct customers and our resellers and oems is considered to have occurred when media containing the licensed programs is provided to a common carrier or  in the case of electronic delivery  the customer is given access to the licensed programs 
fixed or determinable fee the company considers the fee to be fixed or determinable if the fee is not subject to refund or adjustment 
if the arrangement fee is not fixed or determinable  the company recognizes the revenue as amounts become due and payable 
collection is probable the company conducts a credit review for all significant transactions at the time of the arrangement to determine the creditworthiness of the customer 
collection is deemed probable if the company expects that the customer will be able to pay amounts under the arrangement as payments become due 
if the company determines that collection is not probable  the company defers the revenue and recognizes the revenue upon cash collection 
maintenance revenues from ongoing customer support and product upgrades are deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance agreement  typically months 
payments for maintenance fees on initial order or on renewal are generally made in advance and are nonrefundable 
revenues for professional services are recognized as the services are performed 
professional services generally are not essential to the functionality of the software 
our software products are fully functional upon delivery and do not require any significant modification or alteration 
deferred revenue includes revenue not yet recognized as a result of deferred maintenance  professional services not yet rendered and license revenue deferred until all the requirements of sop are met 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we regularly review the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts after considering the size of the accounts receivable aging  the age of each invoice  each customer s expected ability to pay and our collection history with each customer 
we review any invoice greater than days past due to determine if a specific allowance is appropriate based on its risk category 
in addition  we maintain a general reserve for all invoices by applying a percentage to each day age category 
in determining these percentages  we analyze our historical collection experience by region and current economic trends 
if the historical data we use to calculate the allowance provided for doubtful accounts does not reflect the future ability to collect outstanding receivables  additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be needed and the future results of operations could be materially affected 
however  historically the reserve has proven to be adequate 
circumstances that have caused revisions to the allowance calculation have been primarily due to the contraction of the overall economy 
deterioration in the economy could result in more customers being placed in the specific reserve category  thereby increasing our reserve estimate and negatively impacting operating results 
impairment assessments 
we review the carrying amount of goodwill for impairment on an annual basis in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
in addition we perform an impairment assessment of goodwill and other intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets may not be recoverable 
significant changes in circumstances can be both internal to our strategic and financial direction  as well as changes to the competitive and economic landscape 
changes in circumstances that are considered important for asset impairment include  but are not limited to  a decrease in our market capitalization  contraction of the telecommunications industry  reduction or elimination of geographic economic growth  reductions in our forecasted growth and significant changes to operating costs 

table of contents as part of our impairment assessment  we examine economic conditions  products  customer base and geography 
based on these criteria  we determine which products we will continue to support and sell and  thereby  determine which assets will continue to have future strategic value and benefit 
if indicators suggest the carrying value of our long lived assets may not be recoverable we then estimate the fair value of these long lived assets based on the sum of the expected discounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition under the requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
allowance for returns 
for customers having a right of return  the company estimates future returns based on historical experience and other assumptions  to determine if an allowance is appropriate 
to date  the company has experienced an immaterial level of returns  and as a result  the company s allowance for returns has been insignificant 
if historical data used to calculate the allowance for returns does not reflect actual future returns  additional provisions for returns may be needed and future results of operations could be materially affected 
however  historically the reserve has proven to be adequate 
restructuring related assessments 
our critical accounting policy and judgment as it relates to restructuring related assessments in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf no 
liability recognition for certain employee benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring and sfas no 
accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities includes our estimate of the loss related to facility costs and severance related costs 
to determine the facility costs  which are the loss after our cost recovery efforts from subleasing a building  certain estimates were made related to the time period over which the relevant building would remain vacant  sub lease terms  and sub lease rates  including common area charges 
this lease loss is an estimate and will be adjusted in the future upon triggering events such as changes in estimates of time to sub lease and actual sub lease rates 
in the quarter ended september   the fiscal restructuring plan resulted in the elimination of excess facilities 
in the quarter ended june   as a result of a potential tenant terminating negotiations with us  an additional restructuring charge of million was incurred on property leases relating to the fiscal restructuring plan 
the fiscal restructuring plan  which was announced during the quarter ended december   resulted in a decrease of the company s workforce by employees and total restructuring charges of million  relating to severance and employment related charges 
to determine the severance and employment related charges  we have made certain estimates as they relate to severance benefits including the remaining time employees will be retained  the estimated severance period  health benefits and other termination costs as well as the estimated legal costs 
severance and employment related charges for the fiscal restructuring plan could be higher than we have estimated should there be additional arbitration and legal proceedings 
legal contingencies 
the company is subject to various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business 
we have accrued for estimated losses in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for those matters where we believe that the likelihood that a loss has occurred is probable and the amount of loss is reasonably estimable 
although we currently believe that we have adequately accrued for estimable and probable losses regarding the outcome of outstanding legal proceedings  claims and litigation involving us and that such outcome will not have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition  litigation is inherently uncertain  and there can be no assurance that existing or future litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition or that the current amount of accrued losses is sufficient for any actual losses that may be incurred 
accrued commission policy 
the company accounts for commission accruals and related expenses to reflect a liability in the period the obligation arose for the actual amounts to be paid  with the related expense being recorded in the period in which the related revenue was recognized 
the company calculates the total commission liability for all valid purchase orders or approved written contracts received in the period and adjusts the expense for purchase orders or approved written contracts not recognized as revenue in the period because they did not meet one or more of the revenue recognition requirements of sop 
table of contents non gaap financial results we prepare and release quarterly unaudited financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
we also disclose and discuss certain non gaap financial information in the related earnings release and investor conference call 
this non gaap financial information excludes certain non cash and special charges  consisting primarily of the amortization and impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets  write off of in process research and development  restructuring costs  costs of the internal inquiry and restatement  certain stock based compensation  executive recruiting costs  and related income tax effects

cost of maintenance and service revenues decreased as a percentage of maintenance and service revenues to in fiscal  and in fiscal and from in fiscal the improvements in fiscal over fiscal and in fiscal over fiscal were principally due to a proportionally greater percentage of higher margin maintenance revenues as compared to services revenue 
cost of the amortization of developed technology relates to the amortization of developed technology acquired in the acquisitions of can  netops corporation  riversoft plc  lumos technologies inc and nhi over two to six years 
the increase in each of the fiscal years is due to additional acquisitions in the preceding fiscal year 

table of contents operating expenses sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and bonuses earned by personnel engaged in sales  technical presales and marketing activities  as well as the costs of trade shows  public relations  marketing materials and other marketing activities 
sales and marketing expenses were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
sales and marketing expense decreased million in fiscal compared to fiscal due to a decrease of million in sales compensation  of which million resulted from the expiration of a contract for which sales commission had previously been accrued  with the remaining compensation decrease due to a headcount reduction offset by increased travel costs of million  facility costs of million and marketing costs of million

recent accounting pronouncements in march  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
eitf provides guidance on other than temporary impairment models for marketable debt and equity securities accounted for under sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  and sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments held by not for profit organizations  and non marketable equity securities accounted for under the cost method 
the eitf developed a basic three step model to evaluate whether an investment is other than temporarily impaired 
the provisions of eitf were effective for micromuse s fourth quarter of fiscal we do not expect the adoption of eitf to have a material affect on our results of operations and financial condition 
the company has complied with the quantitative and qualitative disclosures for investments accounted for under sfas no 
for the fiscal year ended september  in january  the financial accounting standards board issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin  which was amended by fin r issued in december this interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities vies that either do not have sufficient equity investment at risk to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support  or for which the equity investors lack an essential characteristic of a controlling financial interest 
this interpretation applies immediately to vies created after january  it also applies in the first fiscal year or interim period ending after march   to vies created before february  in which an enterprise holds a variable interest 
fin requires disclosure of vies in financial statements issued after january   if it is reasonably possible that as of the transition date the company will be the primary beneficiary of an existing vie that will require consolidation or  the company will hold a significant variable interest in  or have significant involvement with  an existing vie 
we have completed our review of the requirements of fin and as a result of our review  no entities were identified requiring disclosure or consolidation under fin liquidity and capital resources as of september   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and million in marketable securities  as compared to million in cash and cash equivalents and million in marketable securities as of september  the net increase in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities for fiscal was due primarily to cash provided by operating activities of million and proceeds from issuance of common stock of million 
these sources of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were partially offset by capital expenditures of million  net purchases of marketable securities of million and open market purchases of our stock of million under our previously announced stock repurchase program 
the most significant adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities were depreciation and amortization expenses of million  the increase in net accounts receivables of million which was primarily the result of increased revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal  the net increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of million which was primarily as a result of the company entering into prepaid time based royalty contracts during fiscal  the net decrease in accounts 
table of contents payable of million primarily as a result of a greater percentage of payables becoming due in the final quarter of fiscal in comparison to fiscal  and the net increase in deferred revenue of million which is attributable to the increase in customer base in fiscal as of september   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and million in marketable securities  as compared to million in cash and cash equivalents and million in marketable securities as of september  the net decrease in cash and cash equivalents was due primarily to net purchases of marketable securities of million and net cash outflows of million from two cash based acquisitions 
these outflows of cash and cash equivalents were partially offset by cash provided by financing activities of million from the issuance of common stock and cash provided by operating activities of million 
the most significant adjustments to reconcile net loss to net cash provided by operating activities were depreciation and amortization expenses of million  the net decrease in accounts receivable of million which was primarily as a result of receivables falling due earlier in the final quarter of fiscal compared to fiscal  the net increase in accounts payable of million primarily as a result of a greater percentage of payables not becoming due in the final quarter of fiscal in comparison to fiscal  the net decrease in accrued expenses of million primarily attributable to the decrease in payroll and commission related accruals from million to million as a result of headcount reductions  and the net increase in deferred revenue of million which is attributable to the increase in customer base in fiscal off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any financial partnerships with unconsolidated entities  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which are often established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
accordingly  we are not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had such relationships 
contractual obligations the following summarizes our contractual obligations at september  and the effect the contractual obligations is expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in millions 
total less than year payment due by period more than years years years operating leases operating lease commitments include amounts due for future lease payments on facilities we have exited as part of our restructuring activities 
we believe that our current cash balances and the cash flows generated by operations  if any  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for the next months 
thereafter  if cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may seek to sell additional equity or convertible debt securities or obtain credit facilities 
the decision to sell additional equity or debt securities could be made at any time and would likely result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
a portion of our cash may be used to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or products or to obtain the right to use complementary technologies 
from time to time  in the ordinary course of business  we evaluate potential acquisitions of such businesses  products or technologies 
in addition  as noted above in overview and restatements and related costs of this item  management s discussion and analysis section  we expect significant expenses for professional fees to continue in subsequent quarters during fiscal  and perhaps beyond  due to pending litigation 
we currently estimate that professional service fees associated with pending litigation will be in the range of million to million during fiscal actual fees incurred may be higher or lower depending on many factors beyond

see part i  item legal proceedings for additional information on current legal proceedings 
we also expect significant increases in operating expenses related to the implementation of the internal control requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act of section 
we currently estimate that professional service fees associated with the implementation of section will be in the range of million to million during fiscal working capital our working capital was million at september  compared to million at september   an increase of million or 
the increase in working capital was primarily the result of the million decrease in cash and short term investments  the million increase in net accounts receivables  the million increase in other current assets  the million decrease in accounts payable  and the million increase in deferred revenue

in addition  recent political turmoil in many parts of the world  including terrorist and military actions  may continue to put pressure on global economic conditions 
although there have been signs of improvement in general economic conditions  the improved conditions may not continue or lead to significantly improved demand for our software 
if the economic conditions that affect our customers and our part of the software industry in the united states and globally do not show continued improvement  or if we experience a worsening in the global economic slowdown  we may continue to experience material adverse impacts on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
we may not be able to accurately anticipate the magnitude of these impacts on future quarterly and annual results 
we restated our annual and quarterly financial statements for   and the first three quarters of  we did not file our annual report on form k for fiscal year on a timely basis  and we did not file our quarterly report on form q for the first quarter of on a timely basis 
litigation and regulatory proceedings regarding the restatement of our consolidated financial statements could seriously harm our business 
on december   we announced that we would not be able to file our annual report on form k on a timely basis  that we had initiated an internal inquiry regarding the accounting for certain items  and that we expected that this inquiry would lead to a restatement of historical financial statements 
on february   we announced that the filing of our form q for the first quarter of fiscal year would also be delayed 
the adjustments to previously filed financial results affected our financial statements for the fiscal years ended september  and and our quarterly financial statements for the quarters ended december  through june  please see our annual report on form k for the year ended september   as filed on may   for additional information regarding the restatement and adjustments 
due to the failure to timely file our periodic reports described above  we were not in compliance with the filing requirements for continued listing on nasdaq as set forth in nasdaq marketplace rule c 
as a 
table of contents result  we made a timely request for a hearing before a nasdaq listings qualifications panel to address the filing delinquency  and the nasdaq panel granted our request for an extension of time to complete our filings  subject to certain conditions 
in addition to conditions we fulfilled relating to filing the form k for the fiscal year ended september   and forms q for the first two quarters in fiscal  the nasdaq panel decision requires the company to file timely with the sec all periodic reports for all reporting periods ending on or before march  if the company fails to do so  it will not be entitled to a new hearing on the matter and its securities may be immediately delisted from the the nasdaq stock market 
if there should be any other events of noncompliance with the nasdaq listing standards other than required sec filings  the company would be entitled to notice of the deficiency and an opportunity to present a definitive plan to regain compliance 
we also previously announced that the company and certain of our former and current officers and directors have been named in several lawsuits arising from the restatement announcement 
these cases are still in their early stages and we intend to defend against them vigorously 
see part i  item legal proceedings for a description of this pending litigation 
defending against existing and potential securities and class action litigation relating to the restatement of our consolidated financial statements will likely require significant attention and resources of management and  regardless of the outcome  result in significant legal expenses 
if our defenses were ultimately unsuccessful  or if we were unable to achieve a favorable settlement  we could be liable for large damage awards that could seriously harm our business and results of operations 
in addition  as previously reported  the sec commenced an informal inquiry regarding the circumstances leading up to the restatement of our consolidated financial statements 
if we are required to respond in the future to this inquiry  this could require significant diversion of management s attention and resources 
for example  if the sec elects to pursue an enforcement action  the defense against this type of action could be costly and require additional management resources 
if we are unsuccessful in defending against this or other investigations or proceedings  we may face civil or criminal penalties or fines that would seriously harm our business and results of operations 
if our accounting controls and procedures are circumvented or otherwise fail to achieve their intended purposes  our business could be seriously harmed 
we evaluate our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of each fiscal quarter  have instituted remedial measures concerning our accounting controls and procedures  and are in the process of reviewing and establishing internal control over financial reporting in order to comply with sec rules effective for us for years ending on or after november   relating to internal control over financial reporting adopted pursuant to the sarbanes oxley act of however  we may not be able to prevent all instances of accounting errors or fraud in the future 
our controls and procedures do not provide absolute assurance that all deficiencies in design or operation of these control systems  or all instances of errors or fraud  will be prevented or detected 
these control systems are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving the goals of these systems in light of legal requirements  our resources and nature of our business operations 
these control systems remain subject to risks of human error and the risk that controls can be circumvented for wrongful purposes by one or more individuals in management or non management positions 
our business could be seriously harmed by any material failure of these control systems 
our operating results may vary from quarter to quarter  causing our stock price to fluctuate 
our operating results have in the past  and will continue to be  subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations 
our quarterly revenues and operating results in geographic segments that we track fluctuate and are difficult to predict 
it is possible that in some quarter or quarters our operating results will be below the expectations of 
table of contents public market analysts or investors 
in such event  or in the event adverse conditions prevail  or are perceived to prevail  with respect to our business or financial markets generally  the market price of our common stock may decline significantly 
we typically realize a significant portion of our license revenues in the last month of a quarter  frequently in the last weeks or even days of a quarter 
as a result  license revenues in any quarter are difficult to forecast because it is substantially dependent on orders booked and shipped in that quarter 
moreover  our sales cycle  from initial evaluation to delivery of software  varies substantially from customer to customer 
further  we base our expense levels in part on forecasts of future orders and sales  which are extremely difficult to predict 
a substantial portion of our operating expenses is related to personnel  facilities  and sales and marketing programs 
the level of spending for such expenses cannot be adjusted quickly and is  therefore  relatively fixed in the short term 
accordingly  our operating results will be harmed if revenues fall below our expectations in a particular quarter 
in addition  the number and timing of large individual sales has been difficult for us to predict  and large individual sales have  in some cases  occurred in quarters subsequent to those we anticipated  or have not occurred at all 
the loss or deferral of one or more significant sales in a quarter could harm our operating results 
because of these fluctuations we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful or indicative of our future performance 
a number of other factors are likely to cause these variations  including changes in the demand for our software products and services and the level of product and price competition that we encounter  the timing of new hires and our ability to attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel  including changes in our sales incentives  the mix of products and services sold  including the mix of sales to new and existing customers and through third party distributors and our direct sales force  changes in the mix of  and lack of demand from  distribution channels through which our products are sold  the length of our sales cycles and the success of our new customer generation activities  spending patterns and budgetary resources of our customers on network management software solutions  product life cycles and the timing of introductions or enhancements of products  or delays in the introductions or enhancements of our products and those of our competitors  market acceptance of new products  changes in the renewal rate of maintenance agreements  fluctuations in our gross margins  our ability to achieve targeted cost reductions  actual events  circumstances  outcomes and amounts differing from judgments  assumptions and estimates used in determining the value of certain assets  liabilities and other items reflected in our financial statements  expansion of international operations  including gains and losses on the conversion to united states dollars of accounts receivable and accounts payable arising from international operations and the mix of international and domestic revenue  the extent of market consolidation  software defects and other product quality problems  and the impact of the restatement of our consolidated financial statements and our legal proceedings and their potential effect on customer demand 

table of contents therefore  operating results for a particular future period are difficult to predict and prior results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future periods 
any of the foregoing factors  or others discussed elsewhere herein  could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  financial condition and stock price 
failure to align our employee base with our business may adversely affect our financial results 
over the past few years  we have added customers  personnel and expanded the scope and geographic area of our operations that have placed and will continue to place a significant strain upon our management and our operating and financial systems and resources 
however  we have reduced our headcount from employees on september  to employees on september  to employees on september   mainly as a result of planned reductions and attrition 
given the uncertainties discussed in this risk factors section  together with factors that might affect our ability to quickly expand or contract our work force around the world  it is difficult to predict future requirements for the number and type of employees in the fields and geographies in which we operate 
failure to align employee skills and populations with revenue and market requirements would have a material adverse impact on our business and its operating results 
our restructuring of operations may not achieve the results we intend and may harm our business 
in the quarters ended september  and december   we initiated plans to streamline operations and reduce expenses  which included cuts in discretionary spending  reductions in capital expenditures  reductions in the work force and consolidation of certain office locations  as well as other steps to reduce expenses 
the implementation of our restructuring plans has placed  and may continue to place  a significant strain on our managerial  operational  financial  employee and other resources 
additionally  the company periodically engages in internal reorganizations and or integrating acquired companies or technologies that may negatively affect our performance and our employee turnover as well as recruiting and retention of important employees 
it is possible that these reductions could impair our marketing  sales and customer support efforts or alter our product development plans 
if we experience difficulties in carrying out the restructuring plans  our expenses could increase more quickly than we expect 
if we find that our planned restructurings do not achieve our objectives  it may be necessary to implement further reduction of our expenses  to perform additional reductions in our headcount  or to undertake additional restructurings of our business 
we may fail to support our operations 
to succeed in the implementation of our business strategy  we must execute our sales strategy and further develop products and expand service capabilities  while managing future operations by implementing effective planning and operating processes 
if we fail to manage effectively  our business could suffer 
to manage  we must successfully manage the business with fewer employees due to the restructuring plans  continue to implement and improve our operational  financial and management information systems  hire  train and retain qualified personnel  especially if the business climate improves  continue to expand and upgrade core technologies  effectively manage multiple relationships with various oems  resellers and system integrators  and successfully integrate the businesses of our acquired companies 
we need to continue to expand our distribution channels and retain our existing third party distributors 
we need to continue to develop relationships with leading network equipment and telecommunications providers and to expand our third party channels of distribution through oems  resellers and systems integrators 
we currently invest significant resources to develop these relationships and channels of distribution  which could 
table of contents reduce our ability to generate profits 
third party distributors accounted for approximately  and of our total revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
our business will be harmed if we are not able to retain and attract additional distributors that market our products effectively 
further  many of our agreements with third party distributors are nonexclusive  and many of the companies with which we have agreements also have similar agreements with our competitors or potential competitors 
our third party distributors have significantly greater sales and marketing resources than we do  and their sales and marketing efforts may conflict with our direct sales efforts 
in addition  although sales through third party distributors result in reduced sales and marketing expense with respect to such sales  we sell our products to third party distributors at reduced prices  resulting in lower gross margins on such third party sales 
we believe that our success in penetrating markets for our fault and service level management applications depends substantially on our ability to maintain our current distribution relationships  in particular  those with cisco systems  ibm  ericsson  unisphere siemens and sun microsystems 
our business will be harmed if network equipment and telecommunications providers and distributors discontinue their relationships with us  compete directly with us or form additional competing arrangements with our competitors 
we are dependent on the market for software designed for use with advanced communications services  this market is very dynamic and difficult to predict 
the market for our products is in constant flux and in significant areas is not highly penetrated 
although the rapid expansion and increasing complexity of computer networks in recent years and the resulting emergence of service level agreements has increased  the demand for fault and service level management software products  the awareness of and the need for such products is a recent development 
therefore  it is difficult to assess the size of this market  the appropriate features and prices for products to address this market  the optimal distribution strategy and the competitive environment that will develop 
we are substantially dependent upon telecommunications carriers and other service providers continuing to purchase our products 
telecommunications carriers  including internet service providers  that deliver advanced communications services to their customers accounted for approximately  and of our total revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
in addition  these providers are an important focus of our sales strategy 
if these customers cease to deploy advanced communications services for any reason  the market for our products will be harmed 
also  delays in the introduction of advanced services or the failure of such services to gain widespread market acceptance or the decision of telecommunications carriers and other service providers not to use our products in the deployment of these services would harm our business 
consolidations in  or a continued slowdown in  the telecommunications industry could harm our business 
we have derived and expect to continue to derive a substantial amount of our revenues from sales of products and related services to the telecommunications industry 
the telecommunications industry has experienced significant consolidation in the past few years 
capital spending by this industry has decreased and may continue to decrease in the future as a result of a general decline in economic growth in local and international markets 
recent indicators  however  suggest that certain sectors have stabilized 
our business is highly dependent on the telecommunications industry and on continued capital spending by our customers in that industry 
in the event of further significant slowdown in capital spending of the telecommunications industry  our business would be adversely affected 
furthermore  as a result of industry consolidation  there may be fewer potential customers requiring our software in the future 
larger  consolidated telecommunications companies may also use their purchasing power to create pressure on the prices and the margins we could realize 
our business depends on the continued growth in use and improvement of the internet 
a significant portion of our revenues comes from telecommunications carriers  internet service providers and other customers that rely upon or are driven by the internet 
as a result  our future results of operations 
table of contents substantially depend on the continued acceptance and use of the internet as a medium for commerce and communication 
our business could be harmed if this growth does not continue or if the rate of technological innovation  deployment or use of the internet slows or declines 
furthermore  the growth and development of the market for internet based services may prompt the introduction of new laws and regulations 
laws  which impose additional burdens on those companies that conduct business online  could decrease the expansion of the use of the internet 
a decline in the growth of the internet could decrease demand for our products and services and increase our cost of doing business  or otherwise harm our business  which could result in a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
we face intense competition  including from larger competitors with greater resources than our own  which could result in our losing market share or experiencing a decline in gross margins 
we face intense competition in our markets 
as we enter new markets  we encounter additional  market specific competitors 
in addition  because the software market has relatively low barriers to entry  we are aware of new and potential entrants in portions of our market space 
increased competition is likely to result in price reductions and may result in reduced gross margins and loss of market share 
further  many of our competitors have longer operating histories and have significantly greater financial  technical  sales  marketing and other resources  as well as greater name recognition and a larger customer base  than we do 
as a result  they may be able to devote greater resources to the development  promotion  sale and support of their products or to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements than we can 
existing competitors could also increase their market share by bundling products having functionality offered by our products with their current applications 
moreover  our current and potential competitors may increase their share of the fault and service level management market by strategic alliances and or the acquisition of competing companies 
in addition  network operating system vendors could introduce new or upgrade and extend existing operating systems or environments that include functionality offered by our products  which could render our products obsolete and unmarketable 
our current and prospective competitors offer a variety of solutions to address the fault and service level and enterprise network management markets and generally fall within the following five categories customer s internal design and development organizations that produce service level management and network management applications for their particular needs  in some cases using multiple instances of products from hardware and software vendors such as hewlett packard company  vendors of network and systems management frameworks including computer associates international  inc  vendors of network and systems management applications including hewlett packard company and bmc software  inc  providers of specific market applications  and systems integrators serving the telecommunications industry which primarily provide programming services to develop customer specific applications including tcsi corporation  tti and agilent technologies  inc many of our existing and potential customers and distributors continuously evaluate whether to design and develop their own network operations support and management applications or purchase them from outside vendors 
sometimes these customers internally design and develop their own software solutions for their particular needs and therefore may be reluctant to purchase products offered by independent vendors such as ours 
as a result  we must continuously educate existing and prospective customers as to the advantages of our products versus internally developed network operations support and management applications 

table of contents if we ship products that contain defects  the market acceptance of our products and our reputation will be harmed  and our customers could seek to recover their damages from us 
complex software products frequently contain errors or defects  especially when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released 
because of defects  we could continue to experience delays in or failure of market acceptance of products  or damage to our reputation or relationships with our customers 
any defects and errors in new versions or enhancements of our products after commencement of commercial shipments would harm our business 
in addition  because our products are used to monitor and address network problems and avoid failures of the network to support critical business functions  any design defects  software errors  misuse of our products  incorrect data from network elements or other potential problems within or out of our control that may arise from the use of our products could result in financial or other damages to our customers 
our customers could seek to have us pay for these losses 
although we maintain product liability insurance  it may not be adequate 
further  although our license agreements with our customers typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential claims as well as any liabilities arising from such claims  such provisions may not effectively protect us against such claims and the liability and costs associated therewith 
the sales cycle for our software products is long  and the delay or failure to complete one or more large license transactions in a quarter could cause our operating results to fall below our expectations 
our sales cycle is highly customer specific and can vary from a few weeks to many months 
the software requirements of customers is highly dependent on many factors  including but not limited to their projections of business growth  capital budgets and anticipated cost savings from implementation of our software 
our delay or failure to complete one or more large license transactions in a quarter could harm our operating results 
our software is generally used for division wide or enterprise wide  business critical purposes and involves significant capital commitments by customers 
potential customers generally commit significant resources to an evaluation of available enterprise software and require us to expend substantial time  effort and money educating them about the value of our solutions 
licensing of our software products often requires an extensive sales effort throughout a customer s organization because decisions to license such software generally involve the evaluation of the software by a significant number of customer personnel in various functional and geographic areas  each often having specific and conflicting requirements 
a variety of factors  including actions by competitors and other factors over which we have little or no control  may cause potential customers to favor a particular supplier or to delay or forego a purchase 
we depend on our key personnel  and the loss of any of our key personnel could harm our business 
our success is substantially dependent upon a limited number of key management  sales  product development  technical services and customer support personnel 
the loss of the services of one or more of such key employees could harm our business 
in addition  we are dependent upon our continuing ability to attract  train and retain additional highly qualified management  sales  product development  technical services and customer support personnel 
we have at times experienced and continue to experience difficulty in recruiting qualified personnel 
also  the volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price may also adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key employees  who often expect to realize value from stock options 
because we face intense competition in our recruiting activities  we may be unable to attract and or retain qualified personnel 
in fiscal year  the company appointed arun oberoi as executive vice president  global sales and technical services 
on july   the company named andrew del matto as chief accounting officer  and announced that michael luetkemeyer  after serving three years as chief financial officer  would leave the company at the end of the calendar year 
as announced in micromuse s form k filed september   mr 
del matto left 
table of contents micromuse to pursue other opportunities 
micromuse has appointed ian halifax as the company s chief financial officer  starting january  mr 
luetkemeyer will be staying on as chief financial officer until mr 
halifax joins the company and will remain with the company during the transition period 
on july   michael foster resigned as executive officer of the company but will remain with us until the end of calendar effective september   james de golia resigned as senior vice president and secretary of the company 
on that same date  nell o donnell was named as his successor as senior vice president and corporate and board secretary 
our success depends upon the performance of our executive officers and other key employees and the ability of our management team to work together effectively 
there can be no assurance that the management team will be able to work together effectively  and the effective execution of our business strategy will depend in large part on how well key management and other personnel perform in their positions and are integrated within our company 
we have relied on stock options and employee stock purchase plan participation as a significant element of our compensation philosophy  and any requirement to expense options could negatively affect this 
if we are required to account for options under our employee stock plans as a compensation expense  it would significantly reduce our net income and earnings per share 
we are not currently required to record any compensation expense in connection with option grants to employees that have an exercise price at or above fair market value or purchases under the terms of the employee stock purchase plan 
it is likely that accounting standards will require us to estimate and record fair value of all stock options and shares purchased under our employee stock plans as compensation expense in our consolidated statements of operations for quarterly periods beginning after june  we cannot predict with certainty at this time whether this effective date will remain unchanged  whether additional changes in accounting standards or new laws or regulations will affect the timing or calculation of these expense charges  or whether and how these expense charges may affect our equity compensation plans and practices and ability to retain and motivate our employees 
we have acquired other businesses and we may make additional acquisitions in the future  which will complicate our management tasks and could result in substantial expenditures 
we have acquired other businesses and we may make additional acquisitions in the future  which will complicate our management tasks and could result in substantial expenditures 
in august  we completed the acquisition of riversoft plc  a developer of flexible object modeling and root cause analysis software 
in december  we completed the acquisition of lumos technologies  inc  a developer of sophisticated technology for managing layer networks 
in august  we completed the acquisition of network harmoni  inc nhi a former oem partner and developer of intelligent agents which provides the core data collection technology within netcool system service monitors netcool ssms and netcool application service monitors netcool asms  which gather realtime information about distributed systems  servers  and applications across the it infrastructure 
nhi s opcenter product is a lightweight centralized it management and problem resolution system that is ideally tailored for mid sized enterprise it infrastructures 
the company also assumed several pending patent applications that had already been filed by nhi 
because of these acquisitions  we are integrating distinct products  customers and corporate cultures into our own 
these past and potential future acquisitions create numerous risks for us  including failure to successfully assimilate acquired operations and products  diversion of our management s attention from other matters  loss of key employees of acquired companies  substantial transaction costs  
table of contents substantial liabilities or exposures in the acquired entity that were not known or accurately evaluated or forecast by us  and substantial additional costs charged to operations as a result of the failure to consummate a potential acquisition 
further  some of the products we acquire would require significant additional development before they can be marketed and may not generate revenue at levels we anticipate 
moreover  our future acquisitions  if any  may result in issuances of our equity securities which dilute our stockholders  the incurrence of debt  large one time write offs and creation of goodwill or other intangible assets that could result in amortization and impairment expense 
it is possible that our efforts to consummate or integrate acquisitions will not be successful  which would harm our business 
we have relied and expect to continue to rely on a limited number of products for a significant portion of our revenues 
all of our revenues have been derived from licenses for our netcool family of products and related maintenance  training and consulting services 
we currently expect that netcool omnibus related revenues will continue to account for a substantial percentage of our revenues beyond fiscal and for the foreseeable future thereafter 
although we have netcool omnibus for voice networks  netcool precision  netcool visionary and other products  our future operating results  particularly in the near term  are significantly dependent upon the continued market acceptance of netcool omnibus  improvements to the product and new and enhanced netcool omnibus applications 
our business will be harmed if netcool omnibus does not continue to achieve market acceptance or if we fail to develop and market improvements to netcool omnibus or new or enhanced products 
the life cycles of netcool omnibus  including it s applications  are difficult to estimate due in large part to the recent emergence of many of our markets  the effect of future product enhancements and competition 
a decline in the demand for netcool omnibus as a result of competition  technological change or other factors would harm our business 
we have relied and expect to continue to rely on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of our revenues 
we derive a significant portion of our revenues in any particular period from a limited number of customers 
see concentration of credit risk in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we expect to derive a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of customers in the future 
if a significant customer  or group of customers  cancels or delays orders for our products  or does not continue to purchase our products at or above historical levels  our business will be harmed 
for example  pre existing customers may be part of  or become part of  large organizations that standardize using a competitive product 
the terms of our agreements with our customers typically contain a one time license fee and a prepayment of one year of maintenance fees 
the maintenance agreement is renewable annually at the option of the customer and there are no minimum payment obligations or obligations to license additional software 
therefore  we generally do not have long term customer contracts upon which we can rely for future revenues 
our business is subject to risks from global operations and we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
we license our products in foreign countries 
in addition  we maintain a significant portion of our operations  including the bulk of our software development operations  in the united kingdom 
fluctuations in the value of these currencies relative to the united states dollar have adversely impacted our results in the past and may do so in the future 
see note geographic and segment information in notes to consolidated financial statements for information concerning revenues outside the united states 
we expect that international license  maintenance and consulting revenues will continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenues in the future 
we pay the expenses of our international operations in local currencies and do not currently engage in hedging transactions with respect to such obligations 

table of contents our international operations and revenues involve a number of other inherent risks  including longer receivables collection periods and greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  difficulty in staffing and generally higher costs associated with managing foreign operations  an even lengthier sales cycle than with domestic customers  the impact of possible recessionary environments in economies outside the united states  sales in europe and certain other parts of the world generally are adversely affected in the quarter ending september  as many customers reduce their business activities during the summer months 
if our international sales become a greater component of total revenue  these seasonal factors may have a more pronounced effect on our operating results  changes in regulatory requirements  including a slowdown in the rate of privatization of telecommunications service providers  reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries and tariffs and other trade barriers  changes in or failure to be aware of or to account for payroll  stock option  employee stock purchase and business related taxation  political  economic or terrorism induced instability  lack of acceptance of non localized products  legal and cultural differences in the conduct of business  and immigration regulations that limit our ability to deploy our employees 
we intend to enter into additional international markets and to continue to expand our operations outside of the united states 
such expansion will require significant management attention and expenditure of significant financial resources and could adversely affect our ability to generate profits 
if we are unable to establish additional foreign operations in a timely manner  our growth in international sales will be limited  and our business could be harmed 
rapid technological change  including evolving industry standards and regulations and new product introductions by our competitors  could render our products obsolete 
rapid technological change  including evolving industry standards and regulations and new product introductions by our competitors  could render our products obsolete 
as a result  the life cycles of our products are difficult to estimate and we must constantly develop  market and sell new and enhanced products 
if we fail to do so  our business will be harmed 
for example  the widespread adoption of new architecture standards for managing telecommunications networks would force us to adapt our products to such standard  which we may be unable to do on a timely basis or at all 
in addition  to the extent that any product upgrade or enhancement requires extensive installation and configuration  current customers may postpone or forgo the purchase of new versions of our products 
further  the introduction or announcement of new product offerings by us or one or more of our competitors may cause our customers to defer licensing of our existing products 
our products operate on third party software platforms  and we could lose market share if our products do not operate on the hardware and software operating platforms employed by our customers 
our products operate on third party software platforms and we could lose market share if our products do not operate on the hardware and software operating platforms employed by our customers 
our products are designed to operate on a variety of hardware and software platforms employed by our customers in their networks 
we must continually modify and enhance our products to keep pace with changes in hardware and software platforms and database technology 
as a result  uncertainties related to the timing and nature of new product announcements  introductions or modifications by systems vendors  particularly sun microsystems  inc  
table of contents international business machines corporation  hewlett packard company  cabletron systems  inc and cisco systems  inc 
and by vendors of relational database software  particularly oracle corporation and sybase  inc  could harm our business 
our efforts to protect our intellectual property may not be adequate and third parties have in the recent past claimed and may claim in the future that we are infringing their proprietary rights 
we cannot guarantee that the steps we have taken to protect our proprietary rights will be adequate to deter misappropriation of our intellectual property 
in addition  we may not be able to detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property and take appropriate steps to enforce our rights 
if third parties infringe or misappropriate our trade secrets  copyrights  patents  trademarks or other proprietary information or intellectual property  our business could be harmed 
in addition  protection of intellectual property in many foreign countries is weaker and less reliable than in the united states  so as our international operations expand  the risk that we will fail to adequately protect our intellectual property increases 
further  while we believe that our products and trademarks do not infringe upon the proprietary rights of third parties  other parties may assert that our products infringe  or may infringe  their proprietary rights or we have not fulfilled the terms of agreements with them 
any litigation  whether brought by or against us  may be time consuming  result in high or unanticipated professional expenses and costs  and diversion of technical and management personnel  cause product shipment delays or require us to develop non infringing technology or enter into royalty  licensing or other agreements 
such royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
we expect that software product developers will be increasingly subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps 
see part i  item legal proceedings for a description of pending litigation relating to claims of infringement against us 
we rely on software that we have licensed from third party developers to perform key functions in our products 
we rely on software that we license from third parties  including software that is integrated with internally developed software and used in our products to perform key functions 
we could lose the right to use this software or it could be made available to us only on commercially unreasonable terms 
although we believe that alternative software is available from other third party suppliers or internal developments  the loss of or inability to maintain any of these software licenses or the inability of the third parties to enhance in a timely and cost effective manner their products in response to changing customer needs  industry standards or technological developments could result in delays or reductions in product shipments by us until equivalent software could be developed internally or identified  licensed and integrated  which would harm our business 
our stock price is volatile  exposing us to possible risks of costly and time consuming securities class action litigation 
the market price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile 
the market price may vary in response to many factors  some of which are outside our control  including actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results  announcements of technological innovations  new products or new contracts by us or our competitors  developments with respect to intellectual property rights  adoption of new accounting standards affecting the software industry  litigation related to the restatement of our consolidated financial statements  and general market conditions and other factors 

table of contents in addition  the stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market price for the common stock of technology companies 
these types of broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been initiated against such company 
such litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management s attention and resources that could harm our business 
our goodwill and other long lived assets may become impaired 
due to rapidly changing market conditions  our goodwill and other long lived assets may become impaired such that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable  and we may be required to record an impairment charge impacting our financial position 
as of september   we had approximately million of goodwill and other intangible assets  which relate to the acquisitions of can  netops  riversoft  lumos and nhi 
the company regularly performs reviews to determine if the carrying value of assets is impaired 
as part of our impairment assessment  we examine economic conditions  products  customer base and geography

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency hedging instruments we operate internationally and transact business in various foreign currencies and thus we are exposed to potentially adverse movements in foreign currency rate changes 
this exposure is primarily related to local currency denominated revenues and operating expenses in the uk we have entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce our exposure to foreign currency rate changes on receivables  payables and intercompany balances denominated in a nonfunctional currency 
the objective of these contracts is to neutralize the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our operating results 
these contracts require us to exchange currencies at rates agreed upon at the inception of the contracts 
these contracts reduce the exposure to fluctuations in exchange rate movements because the gains and losses associated with foreign currency balances and transactions are generally offset with the gains and losses of the foreign exchange forward contracts 
because the impact of movements in currency exchange rates on forward contracts offsets the related impact on the underlying items being hedged  these financial instruments help alleviate the risk that might otherwise result from changes in currency exchange rates 
to date  we have not designated our foreign exchange forward contracts as accounting hedges and  accordingly  if such forward contracts remained open at period end  we would adjust these instruments to fair value through earnings in the period of change in their fair value 
however  as of september   no hedging contracts were outstanding

our general policy is to limit the risk of principal loss and ensure the safety of invested funds by limiting market and credit risk
