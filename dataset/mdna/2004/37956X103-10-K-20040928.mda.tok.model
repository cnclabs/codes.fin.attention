item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains  in addition to historical information  forward looking statements  within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of  based on our current expectations  assumptions  estimates and projections 
these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  such as  among others  uncertain demand for our services and products due to economic and industry specific conditions  the risks associated with operating in international markets and our dependence on a limited number of contracts for a high percentage of our revenues 
these risks and others are more fully described in the risk factors section and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
we undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements for any reason  even if new information becomes available or other events occur in the future 
overview since our inception  a majority of our revenues have been generated by our ground segment systems  networks and enterprise solutions business 
contracts for these ground segment systems and networks and communications services have been fixed price contracts in a majority of cases 
profitability of such contracts is subject to inherent uncertainties as to the cost of performance 
in addition to possible errors or omissions in making initial estimates  cost overruns may be incurred as a result of unforeseen obstacles  including both physical conditions and unexpected problems encountered in engineering design and testing 
since our business is frequently concentrated in a limited number of large contracts  a significant cost overrun on any contract could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
contract costs generally include purchased material  direct labor  overhead and other direct costs 
anticipated contract losses are recognized in the period identified 
costs from ground segment systems  networks and enterprise solutions consist primarily of the costs of purchased materials including shipping and handling costs  direct labor and related overhead expenses  project related travel and living costs and subcontractor salaries 
costs from data communications services consist primarily of satellite space segment charges  internet connectivity fees and network operations expenses 
satellite space segment charges consist of the costs associated with obtaining satellite bandwidth the measure of capacity used in the transmission of services to and from the satellite leased from operators 
network operations expenses consist primarily of costs associated with the operation of the network operations center on a twenty four hour a day  seven day a week basis  including personnel and related costs and depreciation 
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  travel and living costs for sales and marketing personnel 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related overhead expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist of expenses associated with our management  finance  contract and administrative functions 
our business had been adversely affected  and to some extent continues to be affected  by the recent global economic slowdown and  in particular  the significant challenges facing the telecommunications industry worldwide 
recently  we have seen improvement in the segments we serve  in particular within the us government and government related entities marketplace 
however  some of the adverse consequences of the downturn continue to impact pricing and competition and we may experience a decline in bookings of contract orders as customers and prospects delay projects  which will negatively impact our business and prospects in the future 
we also may be negatively impacted in the future by a reduction in opportunities from us government and government related agencies 
critical accounting policies certain of our accounting policies require judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
these judgments are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  our observance of trends in the industry  information provided by our customers  and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
actual results may differ from these judgments under different assumptions or conditions 
our accounting policies that require management to apply significant judgment include revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition  for our production type contracts that are sold separately as standard satellite ground segment systems when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the selling price is fixed or determinable  collectibility is reasonably assured  delivery has occurred and the contractual performance specifications have been met 
our standard satellite ground segment systems produced in connection with these contracts is typically short term less than twelve months in term and manufactured using a standard modular production process 
such systems require less engineering  drafting and design efforts than our long term complex production type projects 
revenue is recognized on our standard satellite ground segment systems upon shipment and acceptance of factory performance testing which is when title transfers to the customer 
the amount of revenues recorded on each standard production type contract is reduced by the customer s contractual holdback amount  which typically requires to of the contract value to be retained by the customer until installation and final acceptance is complete 
the customer generally becomes obligated to pay to of the contract value upon shipment and acceptance of factory performance testing 
installation is not deemed to be essential to the functionality of the system since installation does not require significant changes to the features or capabilities of the equipment  does not require complex software integration and interfacing and we have not experienced any difficulties installing such equipment 
in addition  the customer or other third party vendors can install the equipment 
the estimated relative fair value of the installation services is determined by management  which is typically less than the customer s contractual holdback percentage 
if the holdback is less than the fair value of installation  we will defer recognition of revenues  determined on a contract by contract basis equal to the fair value of the installation services 
payments received in advance by customers are deferred until shipment and are presented as deferred revenues 
we recognize revenue using the percentage of completion method of accounting upon the achievement of certain contractual milestones in accordance with statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  for our non standard  complex production type contracts for the production of satellite ground segment systems and equipment that are generally integrated into the customers satellite ground segment network 
the equipment and systems produced in connection with these contracts are typically long term in excess of twelve months in term and require significant customer specific engineering  drafting and design effort in order to effectively integrate all of the customizable earth station equipment into the customers ground segment network 
these contracts generally have larger contract values  greater economic risks and substantive specific contractual performance requirements due to the engineering and design complexity of such systems and related equipment 
progress payments received in advance by customers are netted against the inventories balance 
costs from ground segment systems  networks and enterprise solutions costs related to our production type contracts and our non standard  complex production type contracts rely on estimates based on total expected contract costs 
we use estimates of the costs applicable to various elements which we believe are reasonable 
since these contract costs depend on estimates  which are assessed continually during the term of these contracts  costs are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion 
revision in cost estimates are reflected in the period in which they become known 
in the event an estimate indicates that a loss will be incurred at completion  we record the costs in the period identified 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired primarily from the buyback of the minority interests of netsat 
beginning in the fiscal year ended june  with our adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill and other indefinite life intangible assets are no longer being amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually 
in assessing goodwill  we must make assumptions regarding the estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of our reporting units 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that the goodwill associated with netsat is impaired 
any resulting impairment could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
allowances for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we assess the customer s ability to pay based on a number of factors  including our past transaction history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
an assessment of the inherent risks in conducting our business with foreign customers is also made since a significant portion of our revenues is international 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable  historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness and current economic trends 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate in the future  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventories inventories consist primarily of work in progress from costs incurred in connection with specific customer contracts  which are stated at the lower of cost or market value 
in assessing the realizability of inventories  we are required to make estimates of the total contract costs based on the various elements of the work in progress 
it is possible that changes to these estimates could cause a reduction in the net realizable value of our inventories 
results of operations fiscal years ended june  and revenues from ground segment systems  networks and enterprise solutions 
revenues from ground segment systems  networks and enterprise solutions increased by million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june  the increase in revenues was primarily the result of increased infrastructure sales in the us government and government related entities marketplace  coupled with increased sales due to a general overall improvement in the telecommunications industry segments we serve and the achievement of shipment milestones associated with projects currently in progress 
revenues from data communications services 
revenues from data communications services were consistent at million for the fiscal years ended june  and a significant portion of these revenues was derived from sales of our access plus service 
we expect a shift in revenues from access plus to other service offerings in the future 
costs from ground segment systems  networks and enterprise solutions 
costs from ground segment systems  networks and enterprise solutions increased by million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june  the increase is attributable to a higher revenue base 
costs as a percentage of related revenues decreased to for the fiscal year ended june  from for the fiscal year ended june  the decrease was mainly attributable to cost overruns incurred on a major project during the year ended june  and increased margin on revenues related to us government and government related entities projects during the year ended june  costs from data communications services 
costs from data communications services decreased by million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june  costs as a percentage of related revenues decreased to for the fiscal year ended june  from for the fiscal year ended june  the decrease in costs was primarily due to agreements reached with two of our vendors during february and october  in which we significantly reduced our space segment transponder costs and obligations 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses decreased by million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june  the decrease was primarily due to reduced salary  salary related expenses  and travel and living costs for sales and marketing personnel as part of our cost cutting initiatives 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased by million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june  the increase was due to product research and development initiatives associated with projects currently in progress  research efforts in remote video monitoring systems and internal development of new monitoring and control technologies 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses decreased by million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june  as a percentage of revenues  general and administrative expenses decreased to for the fiscal year ended june  from for the fiscal year ended june  primarily due to the increase in revenues 
on an absolute basis  the decrease in general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended june  is primarily due to the non recurrence of a million allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable from a major customer recorded in the fiscal year ended june   a reduction in legal expenses related to a settlement reached with a customer in the middle east  along with reduction in salaries due to our cost cutting initiatives 
interest income 
interest income decreased by million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june  the decrease was due the reduction of the average balance of cash and cash equivalents due to the cash used in our operations during the fiscal year ended june  along with a reduction in the interest rates 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased by million to zero for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june  the decrease was due to the termination of our capital lease obligation in february gain on sale of available for sale securities 
the gain on sale of available for sale securities of million for the fiscal year ended june   related to the sale of an investment that resulted in proceeds of million in the year ended june  fiscal years ended june  and revenues from ground segment systems  networks and enterprise solutions 
revenues from ground segment systems  networks and enterprise solutions decreased by million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june  the decrease related to a decrease in shipment and or completion of contracts as a result of a decline in bookings of contract orders due to the continued uncertainty surrounding the global economic slowdown in the telecommunications industry  resulting in customers and prospects continuing to delay projects 
revenues from data communications services 
revenues from data communications services decreased by million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june  the decrease reflected changes in market conditions  including the global economic slowdown in the telecommunications industry  pricing pressures in the marketplace and penetration of fiber into areas where we have traditionally provided services  coupled with the termination of services from our largest middle east customer in august during february and october  pursuant to agreements reached with two of our vendors  we assigned contracts with future revenues of million  which reduced our monthly recurring revenues by approximately million 
costs from ground segment systems  networks and enterprise solutions 
costs from ground segment systems  networks and enterprise solutions decreased by million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june  the decrease was attributable to a lower revenue base 
costs as a percentage of related revenues increased to for the fiscal year ended june  from for the fiscal year ended june  the increase was mainly attributable to competitive margin pressure and a million charge  principally in the fourth quarter  related to a major customer for costs to complete certain contracts 
costs from data communications services 
costs from data communications services decreased by million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june  costs as a percentage of related revenues increased to for the fiscal year ended june  from for the fiscal year ended june  the decrease in costs was primarily due to agreements reached with two of our vendors during february and october  in which we significantly reduced our space segment transponder costs and obligations 
these agreements will continue to reduce our future monthly space segment costs 
the increase as a percentage of related revenue was due to a lower revenue base resulting from the termination of services from our largest middle east customer in august  the assignment of million in contract revenues and payments of million for termination fees related to our agreements to reduce our space segment transponder obligations 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses decreased by million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june  the decrease was primarily due to reduced salary and salary related expenses  offset by severance costs associated with reductions in sales and marketing personnel 
research and development 
research and development expenses decreased by million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june  the decrease was attributable to reduced internal development of monitoring and control technologies and the non recurrence of costs associated with the development of various initial subsystems for solutions provided to a new customer in fiscal year general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses decreased by million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues increased to for the fiscal year ended june  from for the fiscal year ended june   primarily due to the decrease in revenues 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended june  primarily resulted from the non recurrence of a million allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable from our largest middle east customer in the fiscal year ended june  of which million was recovered during the fourth quarter of fiscal year ended june   offset by the recording of a million expense provision related to the risk of non collection of a receivable from a major customer and an increase in insurance premiums 
asset impairment charge 
the asset impairment charge of million for the fiscal year ended june   related to a write down of the net carrying value of goodwill relating to the acquisition of a wireless local loop telephone network solutions business during the fiscal year ended june interest income 
interest income decreased by million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june  the decrease was primarily due to a significant decline in cash and cash equivalents due to cash used in operations during the fiscal year ended june  interest expense 
interest expense decreased by million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june  the decrease was the result of less interest paid on a capital lease obligation  which was terminated in february quarterly results the following tables set forth unaudited consolidated financial information for each of the eight fiscal quarters in the period ended june  we believe that this information has been presented on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in the annual report on form k  and we believe all necessary adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  have been included in the amounts stated below to present fairly the unaudited quarterly results of operations when read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for any future period

we may continue to experience significant quarter to quarter fluctuations in our consolidated results of operations  which may result in volatility in the price of our common stock 
see section entitled risk factors 
liquidity and capital resources at june   we had working capital of million  including cash and cash equivalents of million  restricted cash of million  net accounts receivable of million  inventories of million and prepaid expenses and other current assets of million  offset by million in accounts payable  million in deferred revenue and million in accrued expenses and other current liabilities 
net cash provided by operating activities during the fiscal year ended june  was million  which primarily related to an increase in accounts payable of million relating to the increase in revenues and the timing of vendor payments  a decrease in inventories of million due to the timing of shipments on certain jobs  and non cash items representing depreciation and amortization expense of million primarily related to the network operations center and satellite earth station equipment 
these amounts provided were partially offset by the net loss of million  an increase in accounts receivable of million due to the increase in revenues and a decrease in deferred revenues of million due to timing differences between project billings and revenue recognition milestones resulting from specific customer contracts 
net cash used in investing activities during fiscal year ended june  was million  which related to the purchase of million of fixed assets primarily for our network operations center in order to support our existing service base and an increase in restricted cash of million based on certificates of deposit issued as collateral for specific projects  offset by proceeds received of million from the sale of available for sale securities and a repayment of a million promissory note from a related party 
net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal year ended june  was million 
in december  we completed a private placement transaction of equity securities where we issued  shares of common stock at a price of per share for an aggregate price of  and issued warrants to purchase up to  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
we incurred total expenses of approximately million  of which approximately million represented placement agent commissions and approximately million represented other offering expenses 
the net proceeds to the company after deducting total expenses were approximately million 
we also received million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and sale of common stock in connection with the employee stock purchase plan purchase  offset by the purchase of million of treasury stock 
in september  we entered into a one year credit agreement with our existing bank  which provides for a working capital credit facility of up to million consisting of a million secured domestic line of credit the domestic line and a million export import bank secured guaranteed line of credit the exim line 
we will be advanced up to of eligible domestic accounts receivable and of eligible foreign accounts receivable under each respective line of credit  as defined in the agreement 
in march  we amended the agreement to allow us to borrow up to million against the domestic line  reduced by borrowings against the exim line 
the amendment also provided eligibility of up to of the amount of our cash and cash equivalents at the bank  up to the million 
in june  we amended the agreement to allow us to borrow up to million 
each line of credit bears interest at the greater of or the prime rate plus per annum  and is collateralized by a first security interest on all of our personal property 
the credit agreement allows us to borrow and apply letters of credit against the availability under each line of credit 
in addition  the credit agreement contained certain financial and other covenants  deposit requirements  monthly reporting provisions and other requirements  as defined in the credit agreement  with which we were in compliance with at june  as of june   no borrowings were outstanding under this credit facility  however  there were standby letters of credit of approximately million  which were applied against and reduced the amounts available under this credit facility 
we are currently negotiating a new credit facility with our existing bank 
our current credit agreement has been extended until october   while we finalize the terms of a new agreement 
we have received bank funding approval for a new credit facility up to million with similar terms to our current credit agreement 
we anticpate entering into a formal agreement prior to october  we lease satellite space segment services and other equipment under various operating lease agreements  which expire in various years through fiscal future minimum lease payments due on these leases through june  are approximately million 
we have reached a million settlement with a major customer and received initial payments of million million of which was received in july 
this settlement will result in a non recurring gain of approximately million  which will be reflected in our fiscal first quarter ending september  on november   the board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program whereby we can repurchase up to million of our outstanding stock  representing approximately of the total shares outstanding on that date 
since november  we have repurchased an aggregate of  shares for approximately million 
the timing  price  quantity and manner of future purchases will be at the discretion of management  depending on market conditions and other factors  subject to compliance with the applicable securities laws 
we expect that our cash and working capital requirements for operating activities will increase as we continue to implement our business strategy 
management anticipates additional working capital requirements for work in progress for orders as obtained and that we may experience negative cash flows due to quarter to quarter operating performance 
netsat has had  and we expect it will continue to have  working capital and additional capital expenditure requirements  which have  and may continue to put increased pressure on our capital resources 
our future capital requirements will depend upon many factors  including the success of our marketing efforts in the ground segment systems  networks and data communications services business  the nature and timing of customer orders and the extent to which we must conduct research and development efforts internally 
based on current plans  we believe that our existing capital resources will be sufficient to meet working capital requirements at least through june  however  we cannot assure you that there will be no unforeseen events or circumstances that would consume available resources significantly before that time 
for example  future events occurring in response to the hostilities in iraq and afghanistan  or in connection with a war  including  without limitation  future terrorist attacks against the united states or its allies or military or trade or travel disruptions impacting our ability to sell and market our products and services in the united states and internationally may impact our results of operations 
in particular  we currently have two significant contracts with the ministry of communication of the islamic transitional state of afghanistan 
unexpected events negatively impacting international commerce  including additional conflicts in the middle east  could defer our ability to close contracts with international customers 
additional funds may not be available when needed and  even if available  additional funds may be raised through financing arrangements and or the issuance of preferred or common stock or convertible securities on terms and prices significantly more favorable than those of the currently outstanding common stock  which could have the effect of diluting or adversely affecting the holdings or rights of our existing stockholders 
if adequate funds are unavailable  we may be required to delay  scale back or eliminate some of our operating activities  including  without limitation  the timing and extent of our marketing programs and research and development activities and further reductions in headcount 
we cannot assure you that additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments at june   we had contractual obligations and commercial commitments as follows in thousands

during fiscal  we entered into two thirty six month operating lease agreements for satellite space segment transponders on two satellites that were expected to be launched in late and be operational by march future payments due on such agreements through fiscal are approximately million 
such satellite space segment services are scheduled to begin when the satellite transponders are commercially operational  as defined in the agreements 
during fiscal  we learned that the vendor had experienced significant delays in the planned launch and operational dates for the satellites 
as a result of these delays  we maintained that we had a right to terminate the contracts without cost and have provided notification of such termination 
the vendor denied our assertion that we had a right to terminate the contracts without cost 
in march  we reached a settlement with the vendor wherein we agreed to terminate the contracts and use our best efforts to purchase new space segment requirements from the vendor  for up to a total contracted value of million 
in the event we do not enter into million of new contracts by march  we have agreed to pay the vendor a fixed settlement amount of million  which has been included in the contractual obligations amounts shown above 
related party transactions during january  pursuant to a letter agreement we consolidated the then outstanding loan and advances receivable from an individual who is a former executive officer and a current employee into a million promissory note 
under the terms of the letter agreement we will forgive the outstanding principal and interest amounts due on the promissory note in five annual installments beginning in january so long as the former executive officer remains an employee  subject to the terms of the letter agreement 
in march  the company forgave the first installment under the promissory note 
risk factors we have a history of operating losses and negative cash flow and our losses may continue 
we have incurred significant net losses since we began operating in august we incurred net losses of million during the fiscal year ended june   million during the fiscal year ended june  and million during the fiscal year ended june  as of june  our accumulated deficit was million 
we anticipate that we may continue to incur net losses  in any particular quarter  due to the timing of significant projects even if we achieve profitability in the fiscal year ending june  our ability to achieve and maintain profitability will depend upon our ability to generate significant revenues through new profitable customer contracts and the expansion of our existing products and services  including our data communications services 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain new profitable customer contracts or generate significant additional revenues from those contracts or any new products or services that we introduce 
even if we become profitable  we may not sustain or increase our profits on a quarterly or annual basis in the future 
since sales of satellite communications equipment are dependent on the growth of communications networks  if market demand for these networks declines  our revenue and profitability are likely to decline 
we derive  and expect to continue to derive  a significant amount of revenues from the sale of satellite ground segment systems and networks 
if the long term growth in demand for communications networks does not continue to return from recent depressed levels  the demand for our satellite ground segment systems and networks may decline or grow more slowly than we expect 
as a result  we may not be able to grow our business  our revenues may decline from current levels and our results of operations may be harmed 
the demand for communications networks and the products used in these networks is affected by various factors  many of which are beyond our control 
for example  the uncertain general economic conditions have affected the overall rate of capital spending by our customers 
also  many companies have found it difficult to raise capital to finish building their communications networks and  therefore  have placed fewer orders with our customers 
the economic slowdown resulted in a softening of demand from our customers 
we cannot predict the extent to which demand will increase 
further  increased competition among satellite ground segment systems and networks manufacturers has increased pricing pressures 
risks associated with operating in international markets could restrict our ability to expand globally and harm our business and prospects 
we market and sell our products and services in the united states and internationally 
we anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenues for the foreseeable future with a significant portion of the international revenue coming from developing countries 
we presently conduct our international sales in the following geographic areas africa  the asia pacific region  central and south america  eastern and central europe and the middle east 
there are a number of risks inherent in conducting our business internationally  including

these and other risks could impede our ability to manage our international operations effectively  limit the future growth of our business  increase our costs and require significant management attention 
if netsat does not execute its business strategy or if the market for its services fails to develop or develops more slowly than it expects  our results of operations will be harmed 
netsat s future revenues and results of operations are dependent on its execution of its business strategy and development of the market for its current and future services 
despite the settlement agreements which modified and reduced our satellite bandwidth obligations  we cannot assure you that the transponder space will be efficiently and substantially utilized or that an increase in orders will be realized 
netsat has had  and we expect will continue to have  cash requirements  which have and will decrease our cash resources 
if netsat does not efficiently and substantially utilize its transponder space capacity and increase its level of orders  its cash requirements may increase and our results of operations will be harmed 
you should not rely on our quarterly operating results as an indication of our future results because they are subject to significant fluctuations  and if we fail to meet the expectations of public market analysts or investors  our stock price could decline significantly 
our future revenues and results of operations may significantly fluctuate due to a combination of factors  including

the competition in our markets  and 
spacer

spacer 
gif 
difficult global economic conditions and the currency devaluations in international markets  which have adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact our quarterly results 
accordingly  you should not rely on quarter to quarter comparisons of our results of operations as an indication of our future performance 
it is possible that in future periods our results of operations may be below expectations  which could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline 
our markets are highly competitive and we have many established competitors  and we may lose market share as a result 
the markets in which we operate are highly competitive and this competition could harm our ability to sell our products and services on prices and terms favorable to us 
our primary competitors in the satellite ground segment systems and networks market generally fall into two groups system integrators  like itt  data path  and global communication services  and equipment manufacturers who also provide integrated systems  like andrew corporation  tripoint global  alcatel and nd satcom ag 
in the end to end satellite based communication solutions and communications services markets  we compete with other satellite communication companies who provide similar services  like verestar and convergent media systems 
in addition  we may compete with other communications service providers like echostar and at t  and satellite owners like panamsat  loral skynet  new skies satellites nv and intelsat 
we anticipate that our competitors may develop or acquire services that provide functionality that is similar to that provided by our services and that those services may be offered at significantly lower prices or bundled with other services 
these competitors may have the financial resources to withstand substantial price competition and may be in a better position to endure difficult economic conditions in international markets and may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
moreover  many of our competitors have more extensive customer bases  broader customer relationships and broader industry alliances than we do that they could use to their advantage in competitive situations 
the markets in which we operate have limited barriers to entry and we expect that we will face additional competition from existing competitors and new market entrants in the future 
moreover  our current and potential competitors have established or may establish strategic relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase the ability of their products and services to address the needs of our current and prospective customers 
the potential strategic relationships of existing and new competitors may rapidly acquire significant market share  which would harm our business and financial condition 
if the satellite communications industry fails to continue to develop or new technology makes it obsolete our business and financial condition will be harmed 
our business is dependent on the continued success and development of satellite communications technology  which competes with terrestrial communications transport technologies like terrestrial microwave  coaxial cable and fiber optic communications systems 
fiber optic communications systems have penetrated areas in which we have traditionally provided services 
if the satellite communications industry fails to continue to develop  or if any technological development significantly improves the cost or efficiency of competing terrestrial systems relative to satellite systems  then our business and financial condition would be materially harmed 
we may be unable to raise additional funds to meet our capital requirements in the future 
we believe that our available cash resources will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements through june  however  our future liquidity and capital requirements are difficult to predict  as they depend on numerous factors  including the success of our existing product and service offerings  as well as competing technological and market developments 
we may need to raise additional funds in order to meet additional working capital requirements and to support additional capital expenditures 
should this need arise  additional funds may not be available when needed and  even if additional funds are available  we may not find the terms favorable or commercially reasonable 
if adequate funds are unavailable  we may be required to delay  reduce or eliminate some of our operating activities  including marketing programs and research and development programs 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  our existing stockholders will own a smaller percentage of our capital stock and new investors may pay less on average for their securities than  and could have rights superior to  existing stockholders 
a limited number of customer contracts account for a significant portion of our revenues  and the inability to replace a key customer contract would adversely affect our results of operations  business and financial condition 
we rely on a small number of customer contracts for a large portion of our revenue 
specifically  we have agreements with six customers to provide equipment and services  from which we expect to generate a significant portion of our revenues 
if any of these customers is unable to implement its business plan  the market for these customers services declines  or if all or any of the customers modifies or terminates its agreement with us  and we are unable to replace these contracts  our results of operations  business and financial condition would be materially harmed 
if our products and services are not accepted in developing countries with emerging markets  our revenues will be impaired 
we anticipate that a substantial portion of the growth in the demand for our products and services will come from customers in developing countries due to a lack of basic communications infrastructure in these countries 
however  we cannot guarantee an increase in the demand for our products and services in developing countries or that customers in these countries will accept our products and services at all 
our ability to penetrate emerging markets in developing countries is dependent upon various factors including 
spacer

spacer 
gif 

spacer 
gif 
the acceptance of our products and services by customers 
if our products and services are not accepted  or the market potential we anticipate does not develop  our revenues will be impaired 
we depend upon certain key personnel and may not be able to retain these employees 
our future performance depends on the continued service of our key technical  managerial and marketing personnel  in particular  david hershberg  kenneth miller  stephen yablonski and donald woodring 
the employment of any of our key personnel could cease at any time 
unauthorized use of our intellectual property by third parties may damage our business 
we regard our trademarks  trade secrets and other intellectual property as beneficial to our success 
unauthorized use of our intellectual property by third parties may damage our business 
we rely on trademark  trade secret and patent protection and contracts  including confidentiality and license agreements with our employees  customers  strategic collaborators  consultants and others to protect our intellectual property rights 
despite our precautions  it may be possible for third parties to obtain and use our intellectual property without our authorization 
we currently have been granted three patents in the united states  one for remote access to the internet using satellites  another for satellite communication with automatic frequency control  and most recently  we have been granted a patent concerning a monitor and control system for satellite communications networks and the like 
we have two other patents pending in the united states  one for implementing facsimile and data communications using internet protocols and another for a distributed satellite based cellular network 
we currently have one patent cooperation treaty patent application pending for implementing facsimile and data communications using internet protocols 
we also intend to seek further patents on our technology  if appropriate 
we cannot assure you that patents will be issued for any of our pending or future patent applications or that any claims allowed from such applications will be of sufficient scope  or be issued in all countries where our products and services can be sold  to provide meaningful protection or any commercial advantage to us 
also  our competitors may be able to design around our patents 
the laws of some foreign countries in which our products and services are or may be developed  manufactured or sold may not protect our products and services or intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states and thus make the possibility of piracy of our technology and products and services more likely 
we have filed applications for trademark registration of globecomm systems inc  globecomm and gsi in the united states and various other countries  and have been granted registrations for some of these terms in the united states  europe and russia 
we have received trademark registrations for netsat in the united states  the european community  russia  singapore and brazil 
we have various other trademarks and service marks registered or pending for registration in the united states and in other countries and may seek registration of other trademarks and service marks in the future 
we cannot assure you that registrations will be granted from any of our pending or future applications  or that any registrations that are granted will prevent others from using similar trademarks in connection with related goods and services 
defending against intellectual property infringement claims could be time consuming and expensive  and if we are not successful  could cause substantial expenses and disrupt our business 
we cannot be sure that our products  services  technologies and advertising we employ in our business do not or will not infringe valid patents  trademarks  copyrights or other intellectual property rights held by third parties 
we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims from time to time relating to the intellectual property of others in the ordinary course of our business 
prosecuting infringers and defending against intellectual property infringement claims could be time consuming and expensive  and regardless of whether we are or are not successful  could cause substantial expenses and disrupt our business 
we may incur substantial expenses in defending against these third party claims  regardless of their merit 
successful infringement claims against us may result in substantial monetary liability and or may materially disrupt the conduct of  or necessitate the cessation of  our business 
we may not be able to keep pace with technological changes  which would make our products and services become non competitive and obsolete 
the telecommunications industry  including satellite based communications services  is characterized by rapidly changing technologies  frequent new product and service introductions and evolving industry standards 
if we are unable  for technological or other reasons  to develop and introduce new products and services or enhancements to existing products and services in a timely manner or in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements  our products and services would become non competitive and obsolete  which would harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we depend on our suppliers  some of which are our sole or a limited source of supply  and the loss of these suppliers would materially adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we currently obtain most of our critical components and services from single or limited sources and generally do not maintain significant inventories or have long term or exclusive supply contracts with our vendors 
we have from time to time experienced delays in receiving products from vendors due to lack of availability  quality control or manufacturing problems  shortages of materials or components or product design difficulties 
we may experience delays in the future and replacement services or products may not be available when needed  or at all  or at commercially reasonable rates or prices 
if we were to change some of our vendors  we would have to perform additional testing procedures on the service or product supplied by the new vendors  which would prevent or delay the availability of our products and services 
furthermore  our costs could increase significantly if we need to change vendors 
if we do not receive timely deliveries of quality products and services  or if there are significant increases in the prices of these products or services  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our network may experience security breaches  which could disrupt our services 
our network infrastructure may be vulnerable to computer viruses  break ins  denial of service attacks and similar disruptive problems caused by our customers or other internet users 
computer viruses  break ins  denial of service attacks or other problems caused by third parties could lead to interruptions  delays or cessation in service to our customers 
there currently is no existing technology that provides absolute security  and the cost of minimizing these security breaches could be prohibitively expensive 
we may face liability to customers for such security breaches 
furthermore  these incidents could deter potential customers and adversely affect existing customer relationships 
satellites upon which we rely may malfunction or be damaged or lost 
the damage or loss of any of the satellites used by us  or the temporary or permanent malfunction of any of the satellites upon which we rely  would likely result in the interruption of our satellite based communications services 
this interruption would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
risks related to the securities markets and ownership of our common stock our stock price is highly volatile 
from july  through june   our closing stock price ranged from a low of per share to a high of per share 
the market price of our common stock  like that of the securities of many telecommunications and high technology industry companies  could be subject to significant fluctuations and is likely to remain volatile based on many factors  including the following

domestic and international economic factors unrelated to our performance 
additionally  numerous factors relating to our business may cause fluctuations or declines in our stock price 
the stock markets in general and the markets for telecommunications stocks in particular  have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 
accordingly  we cannot assure you that you will be able to resell the shares of common stock at any particular price  or at all 
a third party could be prevented from acquiring shares of our stock at a premium to the market price because of our anti takeover provisions 
various provisions with respect to votes in the election of directors  special meetings of stockholders  and advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and director nominations of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation  bylaws and section of the general corporation law of the state of delaware could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so might be beneficial to our stockholders 
in addition  we have a poison pill in place and employment provisions with our senior executives that have change of control provisions that could make an acquisition of us by a third party more difficult 
risks related to government approvals we are subject to many government regulations  and failure to comply with them will harm our business 
operations and use of satellites we are subject to various federal laws and regulations  which may have negative effects on our business 
we operate fcc licensed earth stations in hauppauge  new york  subject to the fcc act and the rules and regulations of fcc 
pursuant to the fcc act and rules  we have obtained and are required to maintain radio transmission licenses from the fcc for both domestic and foreign operations of our earth stations 
we have also obtained and are required to maintain authorization issued under section of the fcc act to act as a telecommunications carrier  which authorization also extends to netsat 
these licenses should be renewed by the fcc in the normal course as long as we remain in compliance with fcc rules and regulations 
however  we cannot guarantee that the fcc will grant additional licenses when our existing licenses expire  nor are we assured that the fcc will not adopt new or modified technical requirements that will require us to incur expenditures to modify or upgrade our equipment as a condition of retaining our licenses 
we are also required to comply with fcc regulations regarding the exposure of humans to radio frequency radiation from our earth stations 
these regulations  as well as local land use regulations  restrict our freedom to choose where to locate our earth stations 
in addition  prior to a third party acquisition of us  we would need to seek approval from the fcc to transfer the radio transmission licenses we have obtained to the third party upon the consummation of the acquisition 
however  we cannot assure you that the fcc will permit the transfer of these licenses 
these approvals may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us 
foreign ownership we may  in the future  be required to seek fcc approval if foreign ownership of our stock exceeds the specified criteria 
failure to comply with these policies could result in an order to divest the offending foreign ownership  fines  denial of license renewal  and or license revocation proceedings against the licensee by the fcc 
foreign regulations regulatory schemes in countries in which we may seek to provide our satellite delivered data communications services may impose impediments on our operations 
some countries in which we intend to operate have telecommunications laws and regulations that do not currently contemplate technical advances in telecommunications technology like internet intranet transmission by satellite 
we cannot assure you that the present regulatory environment in any of those countries will not be changed in a manner  which may have a material adverse impact on our business 
either we or our local partners typically must obtain authorization for each country in which we provide our satellite delivered data communications services 
the regulatory schemes in each country are different  and thus there may be instances of noncompliance of which we are not aware 
we cannot assure you that our licenses and approvals are or will remain sufficient in the view of foreign regulatory authorities  or that necessary licenses and approvals will be granted on a timely basis in all jurisdictions in which we wish to offer our products and services or that restrictions applicable thereto will not be unduly burdensome 
regulation of the internet due to the increasing popularity and use of the internet  it is possible that a number of laws and regulations may be adopted at the local  national or international levels with respect to the internet  covering issues including user privacy and expression  pricing of products and services  taxation  advertising  intellectual property rights  information security or the convergence of traditional communication services with internet communications 
it is anticipated that a substantial portion of our internet operations will be carried out in countries that may impose greater regulation of the content of information coming into the country than that which is generally applicable in the united states  for example  privacy regulations in countries in europe and content restrictions in countries such as the people s republic of china 
to the extent that we provide content as a part of our internet services  it will be subject to laws regulating content 
moreover  the adoption of laws or regulations may decrease the growth of the internet  which could in turn decrease the demand for our internet services or increase our cost of doing business or in some other manner have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  the applicability of existing laws governing issues including property ownership  copyrights and other intellectual property issues  taxation  libel  court jurisdiction and personal privacy to the internet is uncertain 
the vast majority of these laws were adopted prior to the advent of the internet and related technologies and  as a result  do not contemplate or address the unique issues of the internet and related technologies 
changes to these laws intended to address these issues  including some recently proposed changes  could create uncertainty in the marketplace which could reduce demand for our products and services  could increase our cost of doing business as a result of costs of litigation or increased product development costs  or could in some other manner have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
telecommunications taxation  support requirements  and access charges all telecommunications carriers providing domestic services in the united states are required to contribute a portion of their gross revenues for the support of universal telecommunications services  and some telecommunications services are subject to special taxation and to contribution requirements to support services to special groups  like persons with disabilities 
our services may be subject to new or increased taxes and contribution requirements that could affect our profitability  particularly if we are not able to pass them through to customers for either competitive or regulatory reasons 
internet services are currently exempt from charges that long distance telephone companies pay for access to the networks of local telephone companies in the united states 
efforts have been made from time to time  and may be made again in the future  to eliminate this exemption 
if these access charges are imposed on telephone lines used to reach internet service providers and or if flat rate telephone services for internet access are eliminated or curtailed  the cost to customers who access our satellite facilities using telephone company provided facilities could increase to an extent that could discourage the demand for our services 
likewise  the demand for our services in other countries may be affected by the availability and cost of local telephone or other telecommunications facilities to reach our facilities 
export of telecommunications equipment the sale of our ground segment systems  networks  and communications services outside the united states is subject to compliance with the regulations of the united states export administration and  in certain circumstances  with international traffic in arms regulations 
the absence of comparable restrictions on competitors in other countries may adversely affect our competitive position 
in addition  in order to ship our products into and implement our services in some countries  the products must satisfy the technical requirements of that particular country 
if we were unable to comply with such requirements with respect to a significant quantity of our products  our sales in those countries could be restricted  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to a variety of risks  including foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations relating to certain purchases from foreign vendors and our wholly owned subsidiary  globecomm systems europe limited  which primarily deals in british pounds sterling 
in the normal course of business  we assess these risks and have established policies and procedures to manage our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency values 
our objective to managing our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations is to reduce the impact of adverse fluctuations in earnings and cash flows associated with foreign currency exchange rates 
accordingly  we may utilize from time to time foreign currency forward contracts to hedge our exposure on firm commitments denominated in foreign currency 
during the fiscal years ended june   and  we had no such foreign currency forward contracts 
our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in interest rates primarily from our investment of available cash balances in money market funds with portfolios of investment grade corporate and government securities 
under our current positions  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes
