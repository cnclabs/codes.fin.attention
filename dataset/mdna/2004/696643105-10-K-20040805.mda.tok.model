table of contents we believe the handheld computing and communications device market dynamics are favorable to palmone 
while the market for handheld computers is maturing  our leadership position and our ability to develop high quality products enable us to produce solid performance 
the handheld computing device market also provides a brand  scale and technology development platform that can be leveraged across our entire product portfolio 
the emerging high speed wireless networks which enable true always on connectivity are fueling the growth of the handheld communications device market 
with our computing heritage  we are able to work closely with carriers to deploy advanced wireless data applications that take advantage of their recently deployed wireless data networks 
palmone also has the capability to deliver increased functionality that is easy to use 
we expect to experience growth as a result of including our treo product line in our results for a complete year  as it was included in only a portion of our results during fiscal year in addition  we will work to capitalize on the opportunity created by the reduced commitment of one of our competitors  sony corporation  to the handheld computing space outside of japan 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in palmone s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
however  future events are subject to change and the best estimates and judgments routinely require adjustment 
the amounts of assets and liabilities reported in our balance sheets and the amounts of revenues and expenses reported for each of our fiscal periods are affected by estimates and assumptions which are used for  but not limited to  the accounting for rebates  price protection  product returns  allowance for doubtful accounts  warranty and technical service costs  goodwill and intangible asset impairments  restructurings  inventory and income taxes 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
the following critical accounting policies are significantly affected by judgments  assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue is recognized when earned in accordance with applicable accounting standards and guidance  including staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 revenue recognition  as amended  and aicpa statement of position  or sop  no 
 software revenue recognition  as amended 
we recognize revenues from sales of handheld computing and communication devices under the terms of the customer agreement upon transfer of title to the customer  net of estimated returns  provided that the sales price is fixed and determinable  collection of the resulting receivable is probable and no significant obligations remain 
for one of our web sales distributors  we recognize revenue based on a sell through method utilizing information provided by the distributor 
sales to resellers are subject to agreements allowing for limited rights of return  rebates and price protection 
accordingly  we reduce revenues for our estimates of liabilities related to these rights at the time the related sale is recorded 
the estimates for returns are adjusted periodically based upon historical rates of returns  channel inventory levels and other related factors 
the estimates and reserves for rebates and price protection are based on specific programs  expected usage and historical experience 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
revenue from software arrangements with end users of our devices is recognized upon delivery of the software  provided that collection is determined to be probable and no significant obligations remain 
deferred revenue is recorded for post contract support and any other future deliverables  and is recognized over the support period or as the elements of the agreement are delivered 
vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of the elements contained in software arrangements is based on the price determined by management having the relevant authority when the element is not yet sold separately  but is expected to be sold in the marketplace within six months of the initial determination of the price by management 

table of contents the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts and an assessment of international  political and economic risk as well as the aging of the accounts receivable 
if there is a change in a major customer s credit worthiness or actual defaults differ from our historical experience  our estimates of recoverability of amounts due us could be affected 
we accrue for warranty costs based on historical rates of usage as a percentage of shipment levels and the expected repair cost per unit  service policies and specific known issues 
if we experience claims or significant changes in costs of services  such as third party vendor charges  materials or freight  which could be higher or lower than our historical experience  our cost of revenues could be affected 
long lived assets such as land not in use  property and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not ultimately be recoverable 
determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its ultimate disposition 
we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise  as required under statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill is reviewed for impairment by applying a fair value based test at the reporting unit level within our single reporting segment 
a goodwill impairment loss is recorded for any goodwill that is determined to be impaired 
under sfas no 
 accounting for the disposal of long lived assets  intangible assets are evaluated whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may be impaired 
an impairment loss is recognized for an intangible asset to the extent that the asset s carrying value exceeds its fair value  which is determined based upon the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset  including disposition 
cash flow estimates used in evaluating for impairment represent management s best estimates using appropriate assumptions and projections at the time 
effective for calendar year  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which supersedes emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue no 
 liability recognition for costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring  we record liabilities for costs associated with exit or disposal activities when the liability is incurred instead of at the date of commitment to an exit or disposal activity 
prior to calendar year  in accordance with eitf issue no 
 we accrued for restructuring costs when we made a commitment to a firm exit plan that specifically identified all significant actions to be taken 
we record initial restructuring charges based on assumptions and related estimates that we deem appropriate for the economic environment at the time these estimates are made 
we reassess restructuring accruals on a quarterly basis to reflect changes in the costs of the restructuring activities  and we record new restructuring accruals as liabilities are incurred 
inventory purchases and purchase commitments are based upon forecasts of future demand 
we value our inventory at the lower of standard cost which approximates first in  first out cost or market 
if we believe that demand no longer allows us to sell our inventory above cost or at all  then we write down that inventory to market or write off excess inventory levels 
if customer demand subsequently differs from our forecasts  requirements for inventory write offs could differ from our estimates 
our deferred tax assets represent net operating loss carryforwards and temporary differences that will result in deductible amounts in future years if we have taxable income 
a valuation allowance reduces deferred tax assets to estimated realizable value  based on estimates and certain tax planning strategies 
the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets assumes that it is more likely than not that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions to realize the net carrying value 
if these estimates and related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to adjust our valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets resulting in additional provision benefit to income tax expense 
our key accounting estimates and policies are reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors

income tax provision benefit years ended may  of revenue of revenue increase decrease dollars in thousands income tax provision benefit 
table of contents the income tax provision for fiscal year represented of pretax loss  which represents foreign income taxes 
the income tax provision for fiscal year represented of pretax loss  reflecting a million increase in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets  first established in fiscal year  as well as income taxes in foreign jurisdictions  which are not offset by operating loss carryforwards 
as of the end of fiscal year  palmone had recorded a net deferred tax asset of million 
the realization of the net deferred tax asset was supported by certain identified tax strategies  involving the potential sale or transfer of appreciated assets  which were prudent  feasible and which management would implement  if necessary  to realize the related tax benefits before palmone s net operating loss carryforwards expired 
the identified tax strategies included the potential sale or transfer of certain identified business operations  consisting of our palmsource subsidiary and our wireless access service operations  as well as the transfer of certain intellectual property from a foreign subsidiary to the united states  on a taxable basis 
during the first quarter of fiscal year  there was a significant decline in the value of these identified business operations and assets 
in addition  our business plans had developed such that the potential sale or transfer of palmsource and our wireless access service operations on a taxable basis were no longer feasible tax planning strategies 
as a result  we increased our valuation allowance by million to reflect these changes and to reduce the net deferred tax assets to million  which is the amount supported by the value of our intellectual property transfer strategy which  as of that date and at the end of fiscal year  continues to be prudent  feasible and one that management would implement  if necessary  to realize the related tax benefits before palmone s net operating loss carryforwards expired

comparison of fiscal years ended may  and revenues years ended may  of revenue of revenue increase decrease dollars in thousands revenues revenues for fiscal year decreased approximately from fiscal year the decrease in revenues was primarily driven by a decline in unit shipments reflecting a continued weak economy in both the consumer and enterprise segments and a decline in the average selling price of our handheld devices reflective of a price sensitive and increasingly competitive market 
the average selling price of our handheld devices decreased to approximately per unit in fiscal year from approximately per unit in fiscal year  accounting for approximately of the overall decrease in revenues 
net unit shipments of devices were million device units in fiscal year compared to million device units in fiscal year  
table of contents accounting for just under of the decrease in revenues 
revenues from accessory sales were down by approximately million  or  from fiscal year  reflective of a decrease in device sales and an increase in competition in the accessories business 
these factors were partially offset by a decrease in the provision for product return reserves from of revenue in fiscal year to of revenue in fiscal year this decrease was primarily attributable to lower return rates from our channel partners for product returned to them by their end customers open box returns driven by a decrease in product defects and our channel partners developing alternative means for selling open box returns 
international revenues were approximately of worldwide revenues in fiscal year compared with approximately in fiscal year of the decline in worldwide revenues from fiscal year to fiscal year  percentage points resulted from a reduction in united states revenues and percentage points resulted from a reduction in international revenues 
the relatively smaller decline in international revenues accounts for international revenues providing for a larger share of worldwide revenues in fiscal year despite a reduction in absolute international revenues 
although average selling prices for our handheld devices declined similarly in both the united states and international markets by about from fiscal year to fiscal year  international revenues in absolute dollars declined by only relative to the decline in united states revenues of 
the lower decline in international revenues came from an increase in handheld units sold internationally  representing a increase in fiscal year over fiscal year  versus a reduction in the united states  coupled with a lower decline in accessories revenue internationally a decline internationally in fiscal year over fiscal year versus a decline in the united states 
the international revenues reflected strong year over year performance in europe with increased unit shipments and sell through to end users reflecting european market share gains

the decrease in cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues in fiscal year was primarily due to improvement in component and product transformation costs of approximately percentage points  reduced excess and obsolete costs of approximately percentage points resulting from improved inventory management  and lower product warranty expenses of approximately percentage points as a result of fewer than anticipated claims with respect to electro static discharge issues related to certain products as well as lower repair costs per unit resulting from contract renegotiations and changes in third party repair vendors  partially offset by increased scrap and rework and manufacturing spending of approximately percentage points 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we recorded an inventory related charge of million  or of revenues 
during the first three quarters of fiscal year  we were experiencing high growth rates and product supply constraints  including a limited supply of certain key components 
as a result  we purchased 
table of contents inventory and made purchase commitments with third party suppliers in anticipation of the continuation of this trend 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we experienced a sudden and significant decline in demand for our products 
revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal year were million compared to revenues of million during the third quarter of fiscal year this rapid and unexpected decline in demand for handheld device products and in revenues resulted in us recording a charge totaling million consisting of million of excess inventory and related tooling costs and million of non cancelable inventory purchase commitments in excess of our forecasted needs 
this excess inventory charge was calculated in accordance with palmone s policy  which is based on inventory levels determined to be in excess of anticipated month demand based upon our internal sales and marketing forecasts of product demand and inventory levels in the distribution channel 
during fiscal year  we experienced continued customer demand for the products that had been previously written off and settled the component purchase commitments for less than the original amount 
accordingly  during fiscal year  we recognized a benefit of million  or of revenues  because we were able to sell approximately million of inventory that had previously been written off and to realize approximately million from the favorable settlement of non cancelable component commitments 
there were no similar benefits recognized in fiscal year  as all excess inventory related to the fiscal year inventory charge had been sold or scrapped by the end of fiscal year the amortization of intangible assets and deferred stock based compensation applicable to the cost of revenues decreased as a percentage of revenue and in absolute dollars in fiscal year reflecting the costs incurred for the development and maintenance of the operating system palm os for the six months prior to december   the effective date of the software license agreement between palmone and palmsource

additionally  personnel and related expenses decreased by approximately million and allocated information technology and facilities costs decreased by approximately million primarily due to headcount reductions as a result of our restructuring actions and new lower cost facilities leases 
research and development years ended may  of revenue of revenue increase decrease dollars in thousands research and development research and development expenses in fiscal year decreased approximately from fiscal year approximately million of the decrease in research and development expenses was due to decreased third party development costs  as some of these costs are now incurred in cost of revenues consistent with our

these decreases in expenses were offset by an increased provision for doubtful accounts  of approximately million 
the provision for doubtful accounts was a charge of million in fiscal year compared to a credit of million in fiscal year  this credit was due to collection of certain specifically reserved fiscal year receivables and the overall lower balance of gross accounts receivable at the end of fiscal year headcount at the end of fiscal year decreased by approximately compared to fiscal year  resulting from restructuring actions initiated to align our cost structure with current revenue levels 
amortization of intangible assets and deferred stock based compensation years ended may  of revenue of revenue increase decrease dollars in thousands amortization of intangible assets and deferred stock based compensation the decrease of million of amortization of intangible assets and deferred stock based compensation in fiscal year was the result of palmone recognizing the cost for the development and maintenance of palm os  prior to the effective date of the software license agreement between palmone and palmsource of approximately million during fiscal year certain intangible assets became fully amortized or were impaired  resulting in a reduction of approximately million as well as a million reduction in deferred stock based compensation amortization primarily due to certain restricted stock awards becoming fully amortized

as a result  we adjusted the carrying value to million based upon the estimated fair value at february additionally  a million impairment charge was recorded in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets  related to the core technology acquired as a result of the december business combination with thinairapps  inc the fair value of the core technology of thinairapps was determined using the discounted cash flow method  the thinairapps technology is no longer considered useful  and its carrying value is not considered to be recoverable

interest and other income expense for fiscal year primarily consisted of interest income on our cash balances of million and insurance proceeds of million from a partial insurance settlement of a business interruption claim offset by banking charges of million  impairment of our investments in two privately held companies of million and interest expense of million 
interest income decreased primarily as the result of lower cash balances and reduced interest rates on our investments 
bank charges decreased due to decreased credit card fees of million 
interest expense increased reflective of a full year of interest on our subordinated convertible debt that was issued in the second quarter of fiscal year income tax provision benefit years ended may  of revenue of revenue increase decrease dollars in thousands income tax provision benefit the income tax provision for fiscal year represented of pretax loss  reflecting a million increase in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets  first established in fiscal year  as well as income taxes in foreign jurisdictions  which are not offset by operating loss carryforwards 
as of the end of fiscal year 
table of contents  palmone had recorded a net deferred tax asset of million 
the realization of the net deferred tax asset was supported by certain identified tax strategies  involving the potential sale or transfer of appreciated assets  which were prudent  feasible and which management would implement  if necessary  to realize the related tax benefits before palmone s net operating loss carryforwards expired 
the identified tax strategies included the potential sale or transfer of certain identified business operations  consisting of our palmsource subsidiary and our wireless access service operations  as well as the transfer of certain intellectual property from a foreign subsidiary to the united states  on a taxable basis 
during the first quarter of fiscal year  there was a significant decline in the value of these identified business operations and assets 
in addition  our business plans had developed such that the potential sale or transfer of palmsource and our wireless access service operations on a taxable basis were no longer feasible tax planning strategies 
as a result  we increased our valuation allowance by million to reflect these changes and to reduce the net deferred tax assets to million  which is the amount supported by the value of our intellectual property transfer strategy which  as of that date and at the end of fiscal year  continues to be prudent  feasible and one that management would implement  if necessary  to realize the related tax benefits before palmone s net operating loss carryforwards expired 
the net operating loss carryforwards  which are a significant component of the deferred tax assets of palmone and which totaled million at may   remain available for us to utilize against future profits 
loss from discontinued operations years ended may  of revenue of revenue increase decrease dollars in thousands loss from discontinued operations included in loss from discontinued operations are the results of operations of palmsource and the historical consolidated separation costs incurred to affect the palmsource distribution 
loss from palmsource operations was million for fiscal year and million for fiscal year historical consolidated separation costs were million and million for fiscal years and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents at may  were million  compared to million at may  the decrease of million in cash and cash equivalents was primarily attributable to our net loss from continuing operations of million and our net purchase of short term investments of million partially offset by million of proceeds from the issuance of our common stock to institutional investors under our universal shelf registration statement and proceeds of million from employee stock plan activity 
additional changes in our cash and cash equivalents balances include a decrease in accrued restructuring and other accrued liabilities of million reduced by non cash charges of million 
in connection with investing activities  we used approximately million to purchase property and equipment  which was partially offset by the million we received in connection with the handspring acquisition 
net accounts receivables was million at may   an increase of million  or  from million at may  days sales outstanding  or dso  of receivables increased to days at may  from days at may  the increase in net accounts receivable was primarily due to an increase in revenues of approximately million  or  in the fourth quarter of fiscal year compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal year

palmone has a patent and license agreement with a third party vendor under which palmone is committed to pay million in fiscal year palmone has an agreement with palmsource that grants palmone certain licenses to develop  manufacture  test  maintain and support our products which incorporate palmsource s operating systems 
under this agreement  palmone has agreed to pay palmsource license and royalty fees based upon net shipment revenue of its products which incorporate palmsource s software  a source code license and maintenance and support fees 
the source code license fee is million paid in three equal annual installments in june  june and june annual maintenance and support fees are approximately million per year 
the agreement includes a total minimum annual royalty and license fee commitment of million  million and million during each of the contract years in the period ending december  palmone utilizes contract manufacturers to build its products 
these contract manufacturers acquire components and build product based on demand forecast information supplied by palmone  which typically covers a rolling month period 
consistent with industry practice  palmone acquires inventories through a combination of formal purchase orders  supplier contracts and open orders based on projected demand information 
such formal and informal purchase commitments typically cover palmone s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods ranging from to days 
as of may   palmone s third party manufacturers had inventory on hand and component purchase commitments related to the manufacture of palmone products of approximately million 

table of contents in august  palmone entered into a two year  million revolving credit line with silicon valley bank  or svb 
the credit line is secured by assets of palmone  including but not limited to  cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  accounts receivable  inventory and property and equipment 
the interest rate is equal to svb s prime rate at may  or  at palmone s election subject to specific requirements  equal to libor plus at may  
the interest rate may vary based on fluctuations in market rates 
palmone is subject to a financial covenant requirement under this agreement to maintain cash on deposit in the united states of not less than million 
as of may  palmone had used its credit line to support the issuance of letters of credit of million 
in march  we filed a universal shelf registration statement to give us the flexibility to sell up to million of debt securities  common stock  preferred stock  depository shares and warrants in one or more offerings and in any combination thereof 
the net proceeds from the sale of securities offered are intended for general corporate purposes  including to meet working capital needs and for capital expenditures 
during august  we sold million shares of palmone common stock under the shelf registration statement to institutional investors for net proceeds of approximately million 
we denominate our sales to certain european customers in the euro  in pounds sterling and in swiss francs 
we also incur expenses in a variety of currencies 
we hedge certain balance sheet exposures and intercompany balances against future movements in foreign currency exchange rates by using foreign exchange forward contracts 
gains and losses on the contracts are intended to offset foreign exchange gains or losses from the revaluation of assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the reporting entity 
our foreign exchange forward contracts generally mature within days 
we do not intend to utilize derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
based on current plans and business conditions  we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash requirements for at least the next months 
the net cash used by operating activities during fiscal year was approximately million 
we anticipate our may  total cash  cash equivalents and short term investments balance of million will satisfy our operational cash flow requirements over the next months 
based on our current forecast  we do not anticipate any short term or long term liquidity deficiencies 
we cannot be certain  however  that our underlying assumed levels of revenues and expenses will be accurate 
if our operating results do not meet our expectations or if inventory  accounts receivable  other assets or litigation or other non operating expenses require a greater use of cash than is currently anticipated  we could be required to seek additional funding through public or private financings or other arrangements 
in such event  adequate funds may not be available when needed or may not be available on favorable terms  which could have a negative effect on our business and financial condition 
effects of recent accounting pronouncements in november  the eitf reached an interim consensus on issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  to require additional disclosure requirements for securities classified as available for sale or held to maturity for fiscal years ending after december  those additional disclosures have been incorporated into the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in march  the eitf reached a final consensus on this issue  to provide additional guidance which companies must follow in determining whether investment securities have an impairment which should be considered other than temporary

table of contents business environment and risk factors you should carefully consider the risks described below and the other information in this form k 
the business  results of operations or financial condition of palmone could be seriously harmed  and the trading price of palmone common stock may decline due to any of these risks 
risks related to our business our operating results are subject to fluctuations  and if we fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors  our stock price may decrease significantly 
our operating results are difficult to forecast 
our future operating results may fluctuate significantly and may not meet our expectations or those of securities analysts or investors 
if this occurs  the price of our stock will likely decline 
factors that may cause fluctuations in our operating results include  but are not limited to  the following changes in general economic conditions and specific market conditions  changes in consumer and enterprise spending levels  changes in consumer  enterprise and carrier preferences for our products and services  competition from other handheld or wireless communications devices or other devices with similar functionality  competition for consumer and enterprise spending by other products  seasonality of demand for our products and services  timely introduction and market acceptance of new products and services  variations in product costs or the mix of products sold  quality issues with our products  changes in terms  pricing or promotional programs  loss or failure of key sales and distribution channel partners  failure by our third party manufacturers or suppliers to meet our quantity and quality requirements for products or product components on time  failure to add or replace third party manufacturers or suppliers in a timely manner  failure to achieve product cost and operating expense targets  excess inventory or insufficient inventory to meet demand  and litigation brought against us 
any of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if we do not correctly forecast demand for our products  we could have costly excess production or inventories or we may not be able to secure sufficient or cost effective quantities of our products or production materials and our cost of revenues and financial condition could be adversely impacted 
the demand for our products depends on many factors  including pricing levels  and is difficult to forecast due in part to variations in economic conditions  changes in consumer and enterprise preferences  relatively short product life cycles  changes in competition  demand  seasonality and reliance on key sales and distribution channel partners 
it is particularly difficult to forecast demand by individual product 
in addition  we have limited experience supplying smartphones to the wireless carrier channel which makes forecasting demand for our 
table of contents wireless communications products more difficult 
significant unanticipated fluctuations in demand could result in costly excess production and inventories or the inability to secure sufficient  cost effective quantities of our products or production materials 
this could adversely impact our cost of revenues and financial condition 
the market for handheld computing and communications devices is volatile  and changing market conditions  or failure to adjust to changing market conditions  may adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 
we operate in the handheld computing and communications industry which incorporates both handheld and smartphone devices 
over the last couple of years  we have seen year over year declines in the volume of handheld devices sold while demand for smartphone devices has continued to develop 
although we are the leading provider of handheld products and while we intend to maintain this leadership position  we are rebalancing investment towards smartphone products in response to forecasted market demand trends 
we cannot assure that declines in the volume of handheld device units will not continue or that the growth of smartphone devices will offset any decline in handheld device sales 
if we are unable to adequately respond to changes in demand for handheld and smartphone devices  our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected 
if we are unable to compete effectively with existing or new competitors  we could experience price reductions  reduced demand for our products and services  reduced margins and loss of market share  and our business  results of operations and financial condition would suffer 
the handheld computing and communications device market is highly competitive  and we expect increased competition in the future  particularly as companies from established industry segments  such as mobile handset  personal computer and consumer electronics  enter this market or increasingly expand and market their competitive product offerings or both 
the separation of palmsource into an independent company may result in more competition for our products as palmsource may license the palm os to companies who compete directly or indirectly with us 
some of our competitors or potential competitors possess capabilities developed over years of serving customers in their respective markets that might enable them to compete more effectively than us in certain segments 
in addition  many of our competitors have significantly greater engineering  manufacturing  sales  marketing and financial resources and capabilities than we do 
these competitors may be able to respond more rapidly than we can to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements  including introducing a greater number and variety of products than we can 
they may also devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products 
they may also be better able to withstand lower prices in order to gain market share at our expense 
finally  these competitors bring with them customer loyalties  which may limit our ability to compete despite superior product offerings 
our devices compete with a variety of mobile computing products 
our principal competitors include personal computer companies  such as acer  apple  dell  hewlett packard and toshiba and consumer electronics companies  such as casio  sharp and sony  which also develop and sell handheld computing products running on the palm os and or other operating systems  such as microsoft s windows mobile operating system  linux or proprietary operating systems  wireless email companies  such as research in motion  mobile handset manufacturers which also develop and sell smartphone products such as audiovox  htc corporation  kyocera  lg  motorola  nokia  samsung  sanyo  sendo  siemens  sierra wireless and sony ericsson  and a variety of early stage technology companies such as danger and tapwave 

table of contents some competitors sell or license server  desktop and or laptop computing products in addition to handheld computing and communications products and may choose to market their handheld computing and communications products at a discounted price or give them away for free with their other products  which could negatively affect our ability to compete 
a number of our competitors have longer and closer relationships with the senior management of enterprise customers who decide which products and technologies will be deployed in their enterprises 
moreover  these competitors have larger and more established sales forces calling upon potential enterprise customers and therefore could contact a greater number of potential customers with more frequency 
consequently  these competitors could have a better competitive position than we do  which could result in potential enterprise customers deciding not to choose our products and services  which would adversely impact our revenues 
successful new product introductions or enhancements by our competitors could cause intense price competition or make our products obsolete 
to remain competitive  we must continue to invest significant resources in research and development  sales and marketing and customer support 
we cannot be sure that we will have sufficient resources to make these investments or that we will be able to make the technological advances necessary to be competitive 
increased competition could result in price reductions  reduced demand for our products and services  increased expenses  reduced margins and loss of market share 
failure to compete successfully against current or future competitors could seriously harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if we fail to develop and introduce new products and services successfully and in a cost effective and timely manner  we will not be able to compete effectively and our ability to generate revenues will suffer 
we operate in a highly competitive  rapidly evolving environment  and our future success depends on our ability to develop and introduce new products and services that our customers and end users choose to buy 
if we are unsuccessful at developing and introducing new products and services that are appealing to our customers and end users with acceptable prices and terms  we will not be able to compete effectively and our ability to generate revenues will suffer 
the development of new products and services can be very difficult and requires high levels of innovation 
the development process is also lengthy and costly 
if we fail to anticipate our end users needs or technological trends accurately or are unable to complete the development of products and services in a cost effective and timely fashion  we will be unable to introduce new products and services into the market or successfully compete with other providers 
as we introduce new or enhanced products or integrate new technology into new or existing products  we face risks including  among other things  disruption in customers ordering patterns  excessive levels of older product inventories  delivering sufficient supplies of new products to meet customers demand  possible product and technology defects  and a potentially different sales and support environment 
our failure to manage the transition to newer products or the integration of newer technology into new or existing products could adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our handheld and wireless communications devices may contain errors or defects  which could result in the rejection of our products  damage to our reputation  lost revenues  diverted development resources and increased service costs  warranty claims and litigation 
our handheld and wireless communications devices are complex and must meet stringent user requirements 
in addition  we warrant that our products will be free of defect for to days after the date of purchase  depending on the product 
in europe we are required by law in some countries to provide a two year warranty for certain defects 
in addition  certain of our contracts with wireless carriers include epidemic failure clauses with low thresholds that we have in some instances exceeded 
if invoked  these clauses may entitle the carrier to return or obtain credits for products and inventory  or to cancel outstanding purchase orders 

table of contents we must develop our hardware and software application products quickly to keep pace with the rapidly changing handheld computing and communications market  and we have a history of frequently introducing new products 
products and services as sophisticated as ours are likely to contain undetected errors or defects  especially when first introduced or when new models or versions are released 
in general  our handheld and wireless communications products may not be free from errors or defects after commercial shipments have begun  which could result in the rejection of our products  damage to our reputation  lost revenues  diverted development resources  increased customer service and support costs and warranty claims and litigation which could harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we are highly dependent on wireless carriers for the success of our wireless handheld and smartphone products 
the success of our wireless business strategy and our wireless communications products is highly dependent on our ability to establish new relationships and build on our existing relationships with domestic and international wireless carriers 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in establishing new relationships or advancing existing relationships with wireless carriers or that these wireless carriers will act in a manner that will promote the success of our wireless communications products 
factors that are largely within the control of wireless carriers but which are important to the success of our wireless communications products  include testing of our wireless communications products on wireless carriers networks  quality and coverage area of wireless voice and data services offered by the wireless carriers  the degree to which wireless carriers facilitate the introduction of and actively promote  distribute and resell our wireless communications products  the extent to which wireless carriers require specific hardware and software features on our wireless communications products to be used on their networks  timely build out of advanced wireless carrier networks such as universal mobile telecommunications system  or umts  enhanced data gsm environment  or edge  and evolution data only  or evdo  which are expected to enhance the user experience for email and other services through higher speed and always on functionality  contractual terms and conditions imposed on us by wireless carriers that  in some circumstances  could limit our ability to make similar products available through competitive carriers in some market segments  wireless carriers pricing requirements and subsidy programs  and pricing and other terms and conditions of voice and data rate plans that the wireless carriers offer for use with our wireless communications products 
for example  flat data rate pricing plans offered by some wireless carriers may represent some risk to our relationship with such carriers 
while flat data pricing helps customer adoption of the data services offered by carriers and therefore highlights the advantages of the data applications of our wireless communications products  such plans may not allow our smartphones to contribute as much average revenue per user  or arpu  to wireless carriers as when they are priced by usage  and therefore reduces our differentiation from other  non data devices in the view of the carriers 
in addition  if wireless carriers charge higher rates than consumers are willing to pay  the acceptance of our wireless solutions could be less than anticipated and our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected 
wireless carriers have a lot of bargaining power as we are entering into agreements with them 
they could provide contract terms that are difficult for us to meet and could result in higher costs to complete certification requirements and negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition 
wireless carriers also significantly affect our ability to develop and launch products for use on their wireless networks 
if we fail to 
table of contents address the needs of wireless carriers  identify new product and service opportunities or modify or improve our wireless communications products in response to changes in technology  industry standards or wireless carrier requirements  our products could rapidly become less competitive or obsolete 
if we fail to timely develop wireless communications products that meet carrier product planning cycles or fail to deliver sufficient quantities of products in a timely manner to wireless carriers  those carriers may choose to offer similar products from our competitors and thereby reduce their focus on our products which would have a negative impact on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
as we build strategic relationships with wireless carriers  we could be exposed to significant fluctuations in revenue for our wireless communications products 
because of their large sales channels  wireless carriers may purchase large quantities of our products prior to launch so that the products are widely available 
reorders of products may fluctuate quarter to quarter  depending upon end customer demand and inventory levels required by the carriers 
as we develop new strategic relationships and launch new products with wireless carriers  our wireless communications products related revenue could be subject to significant fluctuation based upon the timing of carrier product launches  carrier inventory requirements and our ability to forecast and satisfy carrier and end customer demand 
the amount of future wireless carrier subsidies is uncertain  and wireless carriers are free to lower or reduce their subsidies with little notice to us  which could negatively impact our revenue and results of operations 
when we sell our wireless products on our own website  we sometimes have the opportunity to earn end customer acquisition subsidies from wireless carriers if the end customer also purchases a voice or data plan from the wireless carrier 
today the wireless industry is generally decreasing subsidies on voice services 
moreover  the wireless carriers that currently provide palmone with subsidies may reduce or discontinue these subsidies with little notice 
while we believe wireless carriers will continue to offer subsidies to palmone  if these subsidies were reduced or eliminated  the gross margins for the affected products sold through our web site would decline and we would be more limited in our ability to price our products competitively to cost sensitive consumers 
if carriers move away from subsidizing the purchase of wireless devices  this could significantly reduce the sales or growth rate of sales of wireless devices 
this could have an adverse impact on our business  revenues and results of operations 
if our wireless products do not meet wireless carrier and governmental or regulatory certification requirements  we will not be able to compete effectively and our ability to generate revenues will suffer 
we are required to certify our wireless products with governmental and regulatory agencies and with the wireless carriers for use on their networks 
the certification process can be time consuming  could delay the offering of our wireless device products on additional carrier networks and affect our ability to timely deliver products to customers 
as a result  carriers may choose to offer  or consumers may choose to buy  similar products from our competitors and thereby reduce their focus on our products  which would have a negative impact on our wireless communications products sales volumes  our revenues and our cost of revenues 
we rely on third parties to sell and distribute our products and we rely on their information to manage our business 
disruption of our relationship with these channel partners  changes in their business practices  their failure to provide timely and accurate information or conflicts among our channels of distribution could adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
the wireless carriers  distributors  retailers and resellers who sell and distribute our products also sell products offered by our competitors 
if our competitors offer our sales and distribution channel partners more 
table of contents favorable terms or have more products available to meet their needs or utilize the leverage of broader product lines sold through the channel  those wireless carriers  distributors  retailers and resellers may de emphasize or decline to carry our products 
in addition  certain of our sales and distribution channel partners could decide to de emphasize the product categories that we offer in exchange for other product categories that they believe provide higher returns 
if we are unable to maintain successful relationships with these sales and distribution channel partners or to expand our distribution channels  our business will suffer 
because we sell our products primarily to wireless carriers  distributors  retailers and resellers  we are subject to many risks  including risks related to product returns  either through the exercise of contractual return rights or as a result of our strategic interest in assisting them in balancing inventories 
in addition  these sales and distribution channel partners could modify their business practices  such as payment terms or inventory levels 
unexpected changes in product return requests  inventory levels  payment terms or other practices by these sales and distribution channel partners could negatively impact our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we rely on wireless carriers  distributors  retailers and resellers to provide us with timely and accurate information about their sales and inventory levels of products purchased from us 
we use this information as one of the factors in our forecasting process to plan future production and sales levels  which in turn influences our public financial forecasts 
we also use this information as a factor in determining the levels of some of our financial reserves 
if we do not receive this information on a timely and accurate basis  our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely impacted 
distributors  retailers and traditional resellers experience competition from internet based resellers that distribute directly to end customers  and there is also competition among internet based resellers 
we also sell our products directly to end customers from our palmone 
com web site and our palmone stores 
these varied sales channels could cause conflict among our channels of distribution  which could harm our business  revenues and results of operations 
we rely on third parties to manage and operate our e commerce web store and related telesales call center  and disruption to this sales channel could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 
we outsource the operations of our e commerce web store and related telesales call centers to third parties 
we depend on their expertise and rely on them to provide satisfactory levels of service 
if these third party providers fail to provide consistent quality service in a timely manner and sustain customer satisfaction  our e commerce web store and revenues could suffer 
if these third parties were to stop providing these services  we may be unable to replace them on a timely basis and our e commerce web store and results of operations could be harmed 
in addition  if these third parties were to change the terms and conditions under which they provide these services  our selling costs could increase 
we rely on third parties to design  manufacture  distribute and support our handheld and wireless communications devices  and our reputation  revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected if these third parties fail to meet their performance obligations 
we outsource most of our hardware design to third party manufacturers 
we depend on their design expertise and we rely on them to design our products at satisfactory quality levels 
if our third party manufacturers fail to provide quality hardware design  our reputation and revenues could suffer 
these third party designers and manufacturers have access to our intellectual property which increases the risk of infringement or misappropriation of such intellectual property 
in addition  these third parties may claim ownership in certain of the intellectual property developed for our products  which may limit our ability to have these products manufactured by others 

table of contents we outsource all of our manufacturing requirements to third party manufacturers at their international facilities  which are located primarily in china and mexico 
we have also entered into an agreement with a third party manufacturer to manufacture our products in brazil 
we depend on these third parties to produce a sufficient volume of our products in a timely fashion and at satisfactory quality levels 
in addition  we rely on our third party manufacturers to place orders with suppliers for the components they need to manufacture our products 
if they fail to place timely and sufficient orders with suppliers  our revenues and cost of revenues could suffer 
our reliance on third party manufacturers  particularly in foreign countries  exposes us to risks that are not in our control  including outbreaks of disease such as an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome  or sars  or bird flu in china  economic slowdowns  labor disruptions  trade restrictions and other events that could result in quarantines  shutdowns or closures of our third party manufacturers or their suppliers 
the cost  quality and availability of third party manufacturing operations are essential to the successful production and sale of our handheld and wireless communications devices 
if our third party manufacturers fail to produce quality products on time and in sufficient quantities  our reputation  business and results of operations could suffer 
we do not have manufacturing agreements with all of the third party manufacturers upon which we rely to manufacture our device products 
the absence of a manufacturing agreement means that  with little or no notice  these manufacturers could refuse to continue to manufacture all or some of the units of our devices that we require or change the terms under which they manufacture our device products 
if these manufacturers were to stop manufacturing our devices  we may be unable to replace the lost manufacturing capacity on a timely basis and our results of operations could be harmed 
if these manufacturers were to change the terms under which they manufacture for us  our manufacturing costs could increase and our cost of revenues could increase 
in addition  our contractual relationships are principally with the manufacturers of our products  and not with component suppliers 
in the absence of a contract with the manufacturer  and one that requires it to obtain and pass through warranty and indemnity rights with respect to component suppliers  we may not have recourse to any third party in the event of a component failure 
we may choose from time to time to change third party manufacturers 
if we transition the manufacturing of any product to a new manufacturer  there is a risk of disruption in manufacturing and revenues and our results of operations could be adversely impacted 
we rely on third party distribution and warehouse services providers to warehouse and distribute our products 
our contract warehouse facilities are physically separated from our contract manufacturing locations 
this requires additional lead time to deliver products to customers 
if we are shipping products near the end of a fiscal quarter  this extra time could result in us not meeting anticipated shipment volumes for that quarter  which may negatively impact our revenues for that fiscal quarter 
as a result of economic conditions or other factors  our distribution and warehouse services providers may close or move their facilities with little notice to us  which could cause disruption in our ability to deliver products 
in addition  we do not have contracts with all of our third party distribution and warehouse services providers 
the absence of agreements means that  with little or no notice  these distribution and warehouse services providers could refuse to continue to provide distribution and warehouse services for all or some of our devices or change the terms under which they provide such services 
any disruption of distribution and warehouse services could have a negative impact on our revenues and results of operations 
for example  we have recently transferred our outsourced distribution and warehouse services for the united states  canada and most of latin america  to a new provider 
until this new service provider fully integrates with our business processes and underlying infrastructure  we may experience interruptions or delays in the delivery of our products  which could have a significant  adverse impact on our market share  revenues  results of operations and financial condition 
changes in transportation schedules due to terrorist threats or attacks  military activity  labor disruptions or carrier financial difficulties could cause transportation delays and increase our costs for both receipt of inventory and shipment of products to our customers 
for instance  our primary domestic freight carrier filed for 
table of contents bankruptcy immediately after the close of our first quarter of fiscal year this led to delayed deliveries to our customers 
additionally  labor disputes of west coast dockworkers in the second quarter of fiscal year led to less capacity and higher costs for the transportation alternatives we normally use 
if these types of disruptions occur  our results of operations could be adversely impacted 
we outsource most of the warranty support  product repair and technical services for our products to third party providers 
we depend on their expertise and we rely on them to provide satisfactory levels of service 
if our third party providers fail to provide consistent quality service in a timely manner and sustain customer satisfaction  our reputation and results of operations could suffer 
we have recently transitioned the majority of our customer and product support to a new third party provider 
if this new provider does not provide support at a level that meets our standards and the expectations of our customers on a timely basis  the satisfaction of our customers and our results of operations could suffer 
we depend on our suppliers  some of which are the sole source for certain components and elements of our technology and some of which are competitors  and our production or reputation could be seriously harmed if these suppliers were unable or unwilling to timely meet our demand or technical requirements on a cost effective basis 
our handheld and wireless communications products contain components  including liquid crystal displays  touch panels  memory chips  microprocessors  cameras  radios and batteries  that are procured from a variety of suppliers 
the cost  quality and availability of components are essential to the successful production and sale of our device products 
some components  such as screens and related integrated circuits  digital signal processors  microprocessors  radio frequency components and other discrete components  come from sole source suppliers 
alternative sources are not always available or may be prohibitively expensive 
in addition  even when we have multiple qualified suppliers  we may compete with other purchasers for allocation of scarce components 
some components come from companies with whom we compete in the handheld computing and communications industry 
if suppliers are unable or unwilling to meet our demand for components and if we are unable to obtain alternative sources or if the price for alternative sources is prohibitive  our ability to maintain timely and cost effective production of our handheld and wireless communications device products will be seriously harmed 
for example  through the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we experienced a critical shortage of screens and related integrated circuits from which we are recovering 
shortages affect the timing and volume of production for some of our products as well as increasing our costs due to premium prices paid for those components 
some of our suppliers are currently capacity constrained due to high industry demand for some components and relatively long lead times to expand capacity 
we enter into agreements for the development and licensing of third party technology to be incorporated into some of our products 
our ability to release and sell our products could be seriously harmed if the third party technology is not delivered to us in a timely manner or contains errors or defects which are not discovered and fixed prior to release of our products 
our inability to obtain alternative technology could result in damage to our reputation as well as lost revenues and divert our development resources from other business objectives 
our product strategy is substantially dependent on the palm os  which is owned by palmsource  an independent public company that was formerly a subsidiary of palmone 
we have a license agreement with palmsource  which extends through december our license of the palm os from palmsource is critical to the operation of our products 
while we are not contractually precluded from licensing or developing an alternative operating system  doing so could be less desirable and could be costly in terms of cash and other resources 
we currently rely exclusively on palmsource to provide the operating system for all of our handheld and wireless communications device products 
termination of this license  an 
table of contents adverse change in our relationship with palmsource  palmsource s failure to supply a competitive platform or an unfavorable outcome in any material lawsuit involving the palm os could seriously harm our business 
additionally  we are contractually obligated to make minimum annual payments to palmsource regardless of the volume of devices we sell containing the palm os 
our business could be seriously harmed if we were to breach the license agreement and palmsource terminated the license  palmsource were to be acquired and the acquiring company was not as strategically aligned with us as palmsource  palmsource does not continuously upgrade the palm os and otherwise maintain the competitiveness of the palm os platform  our palm os based devices drop in volume  yet we still owe palmsource minimum royalties  or we were to develop devices on alternative operating system platforms  which might impact our volumes of palm os based devices and also might impact the perception of palmsource s viability in the market  which could cause a further deterioration of our volume of palm os based devices 
our business would also be harmed if palmsource were not able to successfully implement its business strategy or is otherwise unsuccessful as a stand alone company 
in addition  we cannot assure that palmsource will remain an independent public company 
while our software license agreement with palmsource includes certain protections for us if palmsource is acquired  these protections may not be adequate to fully protect our interests  which may reduce our ability to compete in the marketplace and cause us to incur significant costs 
other than restrictions on the use of certain trademarks and domain names  nothing prohibits palmone from competing with palmsource or offering products based on a competing operating system  and  other than the restrictions on the use of certain trademarks and domain names  nothing prohibits palmsource from competing with palmone or offering palmsource s operating system to competitors of palmone 
palmone and palmsource may not be able to resolve any potential conflicts that may arise between us  which may damage our relationship with palmsource 
palmone is a defendant in several intellectual property lawsuits involving the palm os 
although palmsource generally indemnifies us for damages arising from such lawsuits  other than with respect to the litigation with xerox  and from damages relating to intellectual property infringement by the palm os that occurred prior to the spin off of palmsource  we could still be adversely affected by a determination adverse to palmsource as a result of market uncertainty  or product changes that may be advisable or required due to such lawsuits  or failure of palmsource to adequately indemnify us 
if we are unable to obtain key technology from third parties on a timely basis free from errors or defects  we may have to cancel or delay the release of certain products or features in our products or incur increased costs 
we license third party software and hardware for use in our handheld and wireless communications device products 
this includes the palm os and third party software embedded in the palm os 
our ability to release and sell our products could be seriously harmed if the third party technology is not delivered to us in a timely manner  on acceptable business terms or contains errors or defects that are not discovered and fixed prior to release of our products and we are unable to obtain alternative technology to use in our products 
as a result  our product shipments could be delayed or our offering of features could be reduced  which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

table of contents we have limited use and control of the palm and palmone brands  which could adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we believe that the palm brand is a valuable asset 
prior to our spin off of palmsource  all palm and palmsource trade names  trademarks  service marks and domain names containing the word or letter string palm were assigned to the palm trademark holding company  llc  a holding company owned by palmone and palmsource for the purpose of receiving  holding  maintaining  registering  enforcing and defending such intellectual property 
following our spin off of palmsource  we changed our branding strategy and corporate name to palmone 
while we will continue to use elements of the palm brand pursuant to a trademark license from the holding company  we will have limited use of the palm and palm related brands and we cannot assure that these changes will not have an adverse impact on our business 
if we develop a product based on an operating system platform other than the palm os  we would not be able to use the word or letter string palm in the branding of that product 
because our company name includes the letter string palm  such a product may result in the need to modify our corporate structure  which could be costly  and incur significant marketing expenses to establish a new brand 
in addition  if we are unable in the future to license the palm related trademarks  service marks  domain names and trade names from the palm trademark holding company  llc  or if the holding company fails to enforce its intellectual property rights in them successfully  our competitive position could suffer  which could harm our business 
third parties have claimed  and may claim in the future  that we are infringing their intellectual property  and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products if these claims are successful 
in the course of our business  we frequently receive claims of infringement or otherwise become aware of potentially relevant patents or other intellectual property rights held by other parties 
for example  as our focus has shifted to wireless communicators  we have received  and expect to continue to receive  communications from holders of patents related to gsm  gprs  cdma and other mobile communication standards 
we evaluate the validity and applicability of these intellectual property rights  and determine in each case whether we must negotiate licenses to incorporate or use the proprietary technologies in our products 
third parties may claim that our customers or we are infringing or contributing to the infringement of their intellectual property rights  and we may be found to infringe or contribute to the infringement of those intellectual property rights and may be required to pay significant damages and obligated either to refrain from the further sale of our products  or to license the right to sell our products on an ongoing basis 
we may be unaware of intellectual property rights of others that may cover some of our technology  products and services 
any litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and time consuming and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations 
the complexity of the technology involved and the uncertainty of litigation generally increase the risks associated with intellectual property litigation 
moreover  patent litigation has increased due to the increased numbers of cases asserted by intellectual property licensing entities and to increasing competition and overlap of product functionality in our markets 
claims of intellectual property infringement might also require us to enter into costly royalty or license agreements or indemnify our customers 
however  we may not be able to obtain royalty or license agreements on terms acceptable to us or at all 
we also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development and sale of our products 
if we are unsuccessful in our litigation with xerox  our results of operations and financial condition could be significantly harmed 
we are engaged in a civil action brought by xerox corporation in in new york federal district court alleging willful infringement of a xerox patent by the graffiti handwriting recognition system employed in handheld devices operating the palm os  as described note to consolidated financial statements in this annual report 
we are contractually obligated to indemnify palmsource for the amount of any damages awarded in  or agreed to in settlement of  this litigation or for any claims brought against palmsource by its licensees as a result of this alleged infringement 

table of contents we cannot assure that palmone will be successful in the litigation 
if we are not successful  we may be required to pay xerox significant damages or license fees and pay significant amounts with respect to palm os licensees for their losses 
it may also result in other indirect costs and expenses  such as significant diversion of management resources  loss of reputation and goodwill  damage to our customer relationships and declines in our stock price 
in addition  xerox unsuccessfully sought and might again seek an injunction preventing us or palm os licensees from offering products with palm os with graffiti handwriting recognition software  even though we have largely transitioned our products to a handwriting recognition software that does not use graffiti as well as to physical keyboards 
accordingly  if xerox is successful  our results of operations and financial condition could be significantly harmed and we may be rendered insolvent 
we are subject to general commercial litigation and other litigation claims as part of our operations  and we could suffer significant litigation expenses in defending these claims and could be subject to significant damages or remedies 
in the course of our business  we occasionally receive consumer protection claims  general commercial claims related to the conduct of our business and the performance of our products and services  employment claims and other litigation claims 
any litigation regarding these claims could be costly and time consuming and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations 
the complexity of the technology involved and the uncertainty of consumer  commercial  employment and other litigation increase these risks 
we also may be subject to significant damages or equitable remedies regarding the development and sale of our products and operation of our business 
allegations of health risks associated with electromagnetic fields and wireless communications devices  and the lawsuits and publicity relating to them  regardless of merit  could adversely impact our business  results of operations and financial condition 
there has been public speculation about possible health risks to individuals from exposure to electromagnetic fields  or radio signals  from base stations and from the use of mobile devices 
while a substantial amount of scientific research by various independent research bodies has indicated that these radio signals  at levels within the limits prescribed by public health authority standards and recommendations  present no evidence of adverse effect to human health  we cannot assure that future studies  regardless of their scientific basis  will not suggest a link between electromagnetic fields and adverse health effects 
government agencies  international health organizations and other scientific bodies are currently conducting research into these issues 
in addition  other mobile device companies have been named in individual plaintiff and class action lawsuits alleging that radio emissions from mobile phones have caused or contributed to brain tumors and the use of mobile phones pose a health risk 
although our products are certified as meeting applicable public health authority safety standards and recommendations  even a perceived risk of adverse health effects from wireless communications devices could adversely impact use of wireless communications devices and our reputation  business  results of operations and financial condition 
palmsource may be required to indemnify us for tax liabilities we may incur in connection with the distribution of palmsource common stock to our stockholders  and we may be required to indemnify palmsource for specified taxes 
we received a private letter ruling from the internal revenue service  or irs  to the effect that the distribution of the shares of palmsource common stock held by us to our stockholders would not be taxable to our us stockholders or us 
this ruling is generally binding on the irs  subject to the continuing accuracy of certain factual representations and warranties 
although some facts have changed since the issuance of the ruling  in the opinion of our tax counsel  these changes will not adversely affect us 
we are not aware of any material change in the facts and circumstances of the distribution that would call into question the validity of the ruling 
notwithstanding the receipt of the ruling described above  the distribution may nonetheless be taxable to us under section e of the internal revenue code of  as amended  if or more of our stock or palmsource stock is acquired as part of a plan or series of related transactions that include the palmsource distribution 

table of contents under the tax sharing agreement between palmsource and us  palmsource would be required to indemnify us if the sale of palmsource s common stock caused the distribution of palmsource s common stock to be taxable to us 
palmsource may not be able to adequately satisfy its indemnification obligation under the tax sharing agreement 
in addition  under the tax sharing agreement  palmone has agreed to indemnify palmsource for certain taxes and similar obligations that palmsource could incur under certain circumstances 
finally  although under the tax sharing agreement palmsource is required to indemnify us for taxes of palmsource  we may be held jointly and severally liable for taxes determined on a consolidated basis 
if third parties infringe our intellectual property or if we are unable to secure and protect our intellectual property  we may expend significant resources enforcing our rights or suffer competitive injury 
our success depends in large part on our proprietary technology and other intellectual property rights 
we rely on a combination of patents  copyrights  trademarks and trade secrets  confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
our intellectual property  particularly our patents  may not provide us a significant competitive advantage 
if we fail to protect or to enforce our intellectual property rights successfully  our competitive position could suffer  which could harm our operating results 
our pending patent and trademark applications for registration may not be allowed  or others may challenge the validity or scope of our patents or trademarks  including patent or trademark applications or registrations 
even if our patents or trademark registrations are issued and maintained  these patents or trademarks may not be of adequate scope or benefit to us or may be held invalid and unenforceable against third parties 
we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and police our intellectual property rights 
effective policing of the unauthorized use of our products or intellectual property is difficult and litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights 
intellectual property litigation is not only expensive  but time consuming  regardless of the merits of any claim  and could divert attention of our management from operating the business 
despite our efforts  we may not be able to detect infringement and may lose competitive position in the market before we do so 
in addition  competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies 
intellectual property rights may also be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries  which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share 
in the past  there have been leaks of proprietary information associated with our intellectual property 
we have implemented a security plan to reduce the risk of future leaks of proprietary information 
we may not be successful in preventing those responsible for past leaks of proprietary information from using our technology to produce competing products or in preventing future leaks of proprietary information 
the unauthorized use of our technology or of our proprietary information by competitors could have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell our products 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  existing laws  contractual provisions and remedies afford only limited protection 
intellectual property lawsuits are subject to inherent uncertainties due to  among other things  the complexity of the technical issues involved  and we cannot assure that we will be successful in asserting intellectual property claims 
attempts may be made to copy or reverse engineer aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard a proprietary 
accordingly  we cannot assure that we will be able to protect our proprietary rights against unauthorized third party copying or use 
use by others of our proprietary rights could materially harm our business 
we have an international presence in countries whose laws may not provide protection of our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states  which may make it more difficult for us to protect our intellectual property 
as part of our business strategy  we target countries with large populations and propensities for adopting new technologies 
however  many of these targeted countries do not address misappropriation of intellectual 
table of contents property or deter others from developing similar  competing technologies or intellectual property 
effective protection of patents  copyrights  trademarks  trade secrets and other intellectual property may be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries 
in particular  the laws of some foreign countries in which we are active may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
as a result  we may not be able to effectively prevent competitors in these regions from infringing our intellectual property rights  which would reduce our competitive advantage and ability to compete in those regions and negatively impact our business 
our success largely depends on our ability to hire  retain  integrate and motivate sufficient numbers of qualified personnel  including senior management 
our future success depends on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel  including senior management 
we compensate our employees through a combination of salary  bonuses  benefits and equity compensation 
recruiting and retaining skilled personnel  including software and hardware engineers  is highly competitive  particularly in the san francisco bay area where we are headquartered 
if we fail to provide competitive compensation to our employees  it will be difficult to retain  hire and integrate qualified employees and contractors and we may not be able to maintain and expand our business 
in addition  we must carefully balance the growth of our employees with our anticipated revenue growth 
if our revenue growth or attrition levels vary significantly  our results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected 
volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price may also affect our ability to retain key employees  all of whom have been granted stock options 
the number of shares available for new option grants is limited  therefore  we may find it difficult to provide competitive stock option grants and the ability to hire  retain and motivate key personnel may suffer 
palmone s practice has been to provide incentives to all of its employees through the use of broad based stock option plans 
proposed accounting rules concerning the expensing of stock options may cause us to reevaluate our use of stock options as an employee incentive 
our ability to hire  retain and motivate our personnel may suffer as a result 
in recent quarters  we have initiated reductions in our workforce of both employees and contractors to balance the size of our employee base with our anticipated revenue base and we have seen some turnover in our workforce 
these reductions have resulted in reallocations of duties  which could result in employee and contractor uncertainty 
reductions in our workforce could make it difficult to attract  motivate and retain employees and contractors  which could affect our ability to deliver our products in a timely fashion and negatively affect our business 
our ability to utilize our net operating losses may be limited if we engage in transactions which bring cumulative change in ownership for palmone to or more 
as a result of the acquisition of handspring  we experienced a change in our ownership of approximately 
if over a rolling three year period  the cumulative change in our ownership exceeds  our ability to utilize our net operating losses to offset future taxable income may be limited 
this would limit the net operating loss available to offset taxable income each year following the cumulative change in our ownership over 
in the event the usage of these net operating losses is subject to limitation and we are profitable  our cash flows could be adversely impacted due to our increased tax liability 
we may need or find it advisable to seek additional funding which may not be available or which may result in substantial dilution of the value of our common stock 
we currently believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash requirements for at least the next months 
we could be required to seek additional 
table of contents funding if our expectations are not met 
even if our expectations are met  we may find it advisable to seek additional funding 
if we seek additional funding  adequate funds may not be available on favorable terms  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms  or at all  we may be unable to adequately fund our business plans and it could have a negative effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  if funds are available  the issuance of equity securities or securities convertible into equity could dilute the value of shares of our common stock and cause the market price to fall and the issuance of debt securities could impose restrictive covenants that could impair our ability to engage in certain business transactions 
we may pursue strategic acquisitions and investments which could have an adverse impact on our business if they are unsuccessful 
we have made acquisitions in the past and will continue to evaluate other acquisition opportunities that could provide us with additional product or service offerings or with additional industry expertise  assets and capabilities 
acquisitions could result in difficulties assimilating acquired operations and products  and result in the diversion of capital and management s attention away from other business issues and opportunities 
integration of acquired companies may result in problems related to integration of technology and management teams 
we may not successfully integrate operations  personnel or products that we have acquired or may acquire in the future 
if we fail to successfully integrate acquisitions  our business could be materially harmed 
in addition  our acquisitions may not be successful in achieving our desired strategic objectives  which would also cause our business to suffer 
these transactions may result in the diversion of capital and management s attention away from other business issues and opportunities 
acquisitions can also lead to large non cash charges that can have a material adverse effect on our results of operations as a result of write offs for items such as acquired in process research and development  impairment of goodwill or the recording of deferred stock based compensation 
in addition  we have made strategic venture investments in other companies that provide products and services that are complementary to ours 
if these investments are unsuccessful  this could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
our historical financial information may not be reliable as an indicator of future results due to the spin off of palmsource and the acquisition of handspring 
in addition  charges to earnings resulting from the application of the purchase method of accounting may adversely affect our results of operations 
the historical financial information for palmone  which includes results of the palmsource business as discontinued operations  does not necessarily reflect what palmone s financial condition  results of operations and cash flows would have been had the palmsource business not been a part of palm during historical periods 
in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles  we accounted for the acquisition of handspring using the purchase method of accounting 
under the purchase method of accounting  we allocated the total purchase price to handspring s net tangible assets and amortizable intangible assets  based on their fair values as of the effective date of the acquisition of handspring  and recorded the excess of the purchase price over those fair values as goodwill 
we will incur depreciation and amortization expense over the useful lives of certain of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired in connection with the acquisition of handspring which will have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
in addition  to the extent the value of goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite lives becomes impaired  we may be required to incur material charges relating to the impairment of those assets that may adversely affect our results of operations 
our future results could be harmed by economic  political  regulatory and other risks associated with international sales and operations 
because we sell our products worldwide and most of the facilities where our devices are manufactured  distributed and supported are located outside the united states  our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally  such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates  
table of contents changes in a specific country s or region s political or economic conditions  particularly in emerging markets  changes in international relations  trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements  potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws  compliance with a wide variety of laws and regulations which may have civil and or criminal consequences for us and our officers and directors who we indemnify  difficulty in managing widespread sales operations  and difficulty in managing a geographically dispersed workforce in compliance with diverse local laws and customs 
in addition  we are subject to changes in demand for our products resulting from exchange rate fluctuations that make our products relatively more or less expensive in international markets 
if exchange rate fluctuations occur  our business and results of operations could be harmed by decreases in demand for our products or reductions in margins 
while we sell our products worldwide  one component of our strategy is to expand our sales efforts in china and other countries with large populations and propensities for adopting new technologies 
we have limited experience with sales and marketing in some of these countries 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to market and sell our products in all of our targeted international markets 
if our international efforts are not successful  our business growth and results of operations could be harmed 
we use third parties to provide significant operational and administrative services  and our ability to satisfy our customers and operate our business will suffer if the level of services is interrupted or does not meet our requirements 
we use third parties to provide services such as data center operations  desktop computer support and facilities services 
should any of these third parties fail to deliver an adequate level of service on a timely basis  our business could suffer 
some of our operations rely upon systems interfaces with third parties or upon the internet to communicate information 
interruptions in the availability and functionality of systems interfaces or the internet could adversely impact the operations of these systems and consequently our results of operations 
business interruptions could adversely affect our business 
our operations and those of our suppliers and customers are vulnerable to interruption by fire  earthquake  power loss  telecommunications failure  computer viruses  terrorist attacks  wars  health epidemics and other events beyond our control 
in addition  the business interruption insurance we carry may not be sufficient to compensate us fully for losses or damages that may occur as a result of such events 
any such losses or damages incurred by us could have a material adverse effect on our business 
war  terrorist attacks or other threats beyond our control could negatively impact consumer confidence  which could harm our operating results 
wars  terrorist attacks or other threats beyond our control could have an adverse impact on the united states and world economy  and in general and consumer confidence and spending in particular  which could harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents changes in financial accounting standards or practices may cause adverse unexpected fluctuations and affect our reported results of operations and ability to obtain additional funding 
any change in financial accounting standards or practices that cause us to change the methodology or procedures by which we track  calculate  record and report our results of operations or financial condition or both could cause fluctuations in and adversely affect our reported results of operations and cause our historical financial information to not be reliable as an indicator of future results 
for example  any changes requiring that we record compensation expense in the statement of operations for employee stock options using the fair value method or changes in existing taxation rules related to stock options could have a significant negative effect on our reported results 
several agencies and entities are considering  and the fasb has announced  proposals to change generally accepted accounting principles in the us that  if implemented  would require us to record charges to earnings for employee stock option grants 
this pending requirement would negatively impact our earnings 
in addition  the fasb has proposed a choice of valuation models to estimate the fair value of employee stock options 
these models  including the black scholes option pricing model  use varying methods  inputs and assumptions and may yield significantly different results across models and methods and  based on the models  methods  inputs and assumptions selected  across companies 
if another party asserts that the fair value of our employee stock options are misstated  securities class action litigation could be brought against us or the market price of our common stock could decline or both could occur 
if investors attempt to compare our results with the results of other companies  our company and valuation may appear less attractive  which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and our ability to obtain additional funding on acceptable terms if we find it advisable to seek additional funding 
we own land that is not currently being utilized in our business 
if our expected ability to ultimately recover the carrying value of this land is impaired  we would incur a non cash charge against our results of operations 
we own approximately acres of land in san jose  california which we do not plan to develop 
in the third quarter of fiscal year  we reported an impairment charge to adjust the carrying cost of the land to its then current fair market value 
while we currently have no immediate plans to sell this property  a future sale or other disposition of the land at less than its carrying value  or a further deterioration in market values that impacts our expected recoverable value  would result in a non cash charge which would negatively impact our results of operations 
recently enacted and proposed changes in securities laws and regulations have increased and will continue to increase our costs 
the sarbanes oxley act of along with other recent and proposed rules from the sec and nasdaq have required changes in our corporate governance  public disclosure and compliance practices 
many of these new requirements increase our legal and financial compliance costs  and make some corporate actions more difficult  such as proposing new or amendments to stock option plans  which now requires stockholder approval 
for example  compliance with sarbanes oxley section will require the commitment of significant resources to document and review internal controls over financial reporting 
in addition  these developments could make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance  and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage 
these developments also could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified executive officers and qualified members of our board of directors  particularly to serve on our audit committee 

table of contents risks related to the securities markets and ownership of our common stock our common stock price may be subject to significant fluctuations and volatility 
the market price of our common stock has been subject to significant fluctuations since the date of our initial public offering 
these fluctuations could continue 
among the factors that could affect our stock price are quarterly variations in our operating results  changes in revenues or earnings estimates or publication of research reports by analysts  speculation in the press or investment community  strategic actions by us  our customers  our suppliers or our competitors  such as new product announcements  acquisitions or restructurings  actions by institutional stockholders or financial analysts  general market conditions  and domestic and international economic factors unrelated to our performance 
the stock markets in general  and the markets for high technology stocks in particular  have experienced high volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 
provisions in our charter documents and delaware law and our adoption of a stockholder rights plan may delay or prevent acquisition of us  which could decrease the value of shares of our common stock 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors 
these provisions include a classified board of directors and limitations on actions by our stockholders by written consent 
delaware law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of or more of our outstanding common stock 
in addition  our board of directors has the right to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval  which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer 
although we believe these provisions provide for an opportunity to receive a higher bid by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors  these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders 
our board of directors adopted a stockholder rights plan  pursuant to which we declared and paid a dividend of one right for each share of common stock outstanding as of november  unless redeemed by us prior to the time the rights are exercised  upon the occurrence of certain events  the rights will entitle the holders to receive upon exercise thereof shares of our preferred stock  or shares of an acquiring entity  having a value equal to twice the then current exercise price of the right 
the issuance of the rights could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of us 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity we currently maintain an investment portfolio consisting mainly of cash equivalents and short term investments 
these available for sale securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
the objectives of our investment activities are to maintain the safety of principal  assure sufficient liquidity and achieve appropriate returns 
this is accomplished by investing in marketable investment grade securities  by capping the maturity of the security to less than two years and by limiting exposure to any one issue or issuer 
we do not use derivative financial investments in our investment portfolio 
our cash equivalents are primarily debt securities with maturities of less than days  and an immediate and uniform 
table of contents increase in market interest rates of basis points from levels at may  would cause an immaterial decline in the fair value of our cash equivalents 
our short term investment portfolio primarily consists of debt securities with maturities of greater than days but less than two years  and an immediate and uniform increase in market interest rates of basis points from levels at may   would cause a decline of less than in the fair market value of our short term investment portfolio 
we would expect our operating results or cash flows to be similarly affected by such a change in market interest rates 
foreign currency exchange risk we denominate our sales to certain european customers in the euro  in pounds sterling and in swiss francs 
expenses and other transactions are also incurred in a variety of currencies 
we hedge certain balance sheet exposures and intercompany balances against future movements in foreign currency exchange rates by using foreign exchange forward contracts 
gains and losses on the contracts are intended to offset foreign exchange gains or losses from the revaluation of assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the reporting entity 
our foreign exchange forward contracts generally mature within days 
we do not intend to utilize derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
movements in currency exchange rates could cause variability in our revenues  expenses or interest and other income expense
