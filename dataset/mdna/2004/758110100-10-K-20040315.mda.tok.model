critical accounting policies the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to sales returns and allowances  the realizability of outstanding accounts receivable  the carrying value of inventories  hedging policies  and the provision for income taxes 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
in the past  actual results have not been materially different from the company s estimates 
however  results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company has identified the following as critical accounting policies based on the significant judgments and estimates used in determining the amounts reported in its consolidated financial statements sales returns and allowances the company records reductions to revenue for estimated customer returns and allowances 
the company bases its estimates on historical rates of customer returns and allowances as well as the specific identification of outstanding returns and allowances that have not yet been received by the company 
the actual amount of customer returns or allowances  which is inherently uncertain  may differ from the company s estimates 
if actual or expected returns and allowances were significantly greater or lower than the reserves the company had established  the company would record a reduction or increase to net sales in the period in which it made such a determination 
accounts receivable the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
the company estimates potential losses based on the company s historical rate of credit losses  its knowledge of the financial condition of certain customers and an assessment of the overall conditions at retail 
historically  losses have been within the company s expectations 
if the financial condition of the company s customers was to change  adjustments may be required to these estimates 
furthermore  the company provides for estimated losses resulting from differences which arise from the gross carrying value of its receivables and the amounts that customers estimate are owed to the company 
the settlement or resolution of these differences could result in future changes to these estimates 
if the company determined that increases or decreases to the allowance for doubtful accounts was appropriate  the company would record a charge or credit to selling  general and administrative expense in the period in which the company made such a determination 
inventory valuation the company values its inventory at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
market value is estimated based upon assumptions made about future demand and retail market conditions 
if the company determines that the estimated market value of its inventory is less than the carrying value of such inventory  the company provides a reserve for such difference as a charge to cost of sales 
if actual market conditions are more or less favorable than those projected by the company  further adjustments may be required that would decrease or increase the company s cost of sales and net income in the period in which they were recorded 
hedging policies the company uses foreign currency forward contracts  options contracts and interest rate swap agreements to hedge its exposure to merchandise purchased in us dollars that is forecasted to be sold to customers in other currencies  significant assets and liabilities that are denominated in other currencies  and interest rate movement 
if actual fluctuations in foreign exchange rates or interest rates are more or less favorable than those projected by management  or if the actual amount of merchandise purchased in us dollars to be sold to customers in other currencies differs from the amounts projected  future operating results may be impacted by adjustments to these estimates 
income taxes the carrying value of the company s net deferred tax assets assumes that the company will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions to realize the value of these assets 
if the company is unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in these jurisdictions an adjustment may be required in the net carrying value of the deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expense in the company s consolidated statement of income 
management evaluates the realizability of the deferred tax assets and assesses the need for any valuation adjustment quarterly 
recently issued accounting standards the company has described the impact anticipated from the adoption of certain new accounting pronouncements effective in in note to the consolidated financial statements 
constant dollar comparisons the company provides certain constant dollar comparisons  which eliminate the effect of foreign currency fluctuations on such comparisons  in this annual report on form k 
constant dollars are calculated by translating the prior period financial information at the current period foreign exchange rates  thereby eliminating the effect of foreign currency fluctuations 
because of the significance of the company s international operations and because of the significant fluctuation that has occurred in foreign currency values as compared to the us dollar  the company believes that disclosing constant dollar comparisons in certain instances assists in the readers understanding of the company s consolidated financial statements 
however  such comparisons may not reflect future changes in currency

issues and uncertainties the market for athletic footwear and apparel is intensely competitive and if we fail to compete effectively  we could lose our market position 
the athletic footwear and apparel industry is intensely competitive 
the principal methods of competition in our industry include product design  product performance  quality  price  brand image  marketing and promotion  customer support and service and our ability to meet delivery commitments to retailers 
a major marketing or promotional success or technological innovation by one of our competitors could adversely impact our competitive position 
additionally  in countries where the athletic footwear market is mature  our ability to maintain and increase our market share can principally come at the expense of our competitors  which may be difficult to accomplish 
our results of operations and market position may be adversely impacted by our competitors and the competitive pressures in the athletic footwear and apparel industries 
the loss of a significant customer  or a significant reduction in our sales to such a customer  could adversely affect our sales and results of operations 
while no single customer accounted for or more of our overall net sales in  we do have significant customers 
the loss of any of these customers  or a significant reduction in our sales to any of such customers  could adversely affect our sales and results of operations 
in addition  if any of such customers became insolvent or otherwise failed to pay its debts  it could have an adverse affect on our results of operations 
our athletic footwear and apparel business is subject to consumer preferences and unanticipated shifts in consumer preferences could adversely affect our sales and results of operations 
the footwear and apparel industry is subject to rapid changes in consumer preferences 
consumer demand for athletic footwear and apparel is heavily influenced by brand image 
our initiatives to strengthen our brand image  which include conducting extensive market research  introducing new and innovative products that emphasize fashion and initiating focused advertising campaigns  may not be successful 
additionally  consumers place an emphasis on the performance aspect of our athletic footwear 
consequently  we must utilize current and future technology to continue to offer performance oriented products 
our failure to anticipate  identify and react to shifts in consumer preferences and maintain a strong brand image could have an adverse effect on our sales and results of operations 
if we fail to accurately forecast consumer demand  we may experience difficulties in handling customer orders or in liquidating excess inventories and our sales and brand image may be adversely affected 
the athletic footwear industry has relatively long lead times for the design and production of products 
consequently  we must commit to production tooling  and in some cases to production  in advance of orders based on our forecasts of consumer demand 
if we fail to forecast consumer demand accurately  we may under produce or over produce a product and encounter difficulty in handling customer orders or in liquidating excess inventory 
additionally  if we over produce a product based on an aggressive forecast of consumer demand  retailers may not be able to sell the product and may seek to return the unsold quantities and cancel future orders 
these outcomes could have an adverse effect on our sales and brand image 
our advertising and marketing expenditures are based on our sales forecasts and our failure to achieve these sales forecasts could adversely affect our profitability 
our advertising and marketing expenditures are based on sales forecasts 
these expenditures are made in advance of actual sales 
because the markets in which we do business are highly competitive and our sales are affected by a variety of factors  including brand awareness  changing consumer preferences and retail market conditions  we may be unable to achieve our sales forecasts 
our failure to achieve our sales forecasts would result in our advertising and marketing expenditures representing a higher percentage of revenues and we could experience higher inventory levels and associated carrying costs  all of which could adversely affect our profitability 
if we decrease the price that we charge for our products  we may earn lower gross margins and our revenues and profitability may be adversely affected 
the prices that we are able to charge for our products depend on the type of product offered  the consumer and retailer response to the product and the prices charged by our competitors 
to the extent that we are forced to lower our prices  our gross margins will be lower and our revenues and profitability may be adversely affected 
our report of our backlog of open orders may not be indicative of our level of future sales 
we report our backlog of open orders for our reebok brand 
our backlog position may not be indicative of future sales because many customer orders are cancelable with little or no penalty  currencies may fluctuate  sales by our company owned retail outlet stores are not included in our backlog and can vary from year to year  many markets in latin america and asia pacific are not included in our backlog because sales in such markets are made by independent distributors  and the ratio of orders booked early to at once shipments can vary from period to period 
our business may be adversely affected by a decrease in the popularity of the sports leagues and other brands we license 
our sports licensing business  in which sports leagues and organizations such as the nfl and the nba license us to sell branded footwear  apparel and other products  is an important and growing part of our business 
in addition to the ability to sell licensed product  the license agreements often provide us with important branding opportunities for reebok s other core brands through on field presence 
similarly  we license the ralph lauren and polo brand names  and the greg norman brand name  for use by our ralph lauren footwear and greg norman collection businesses  respectively 
the success of our sports licensing business as well as our ralph lauren footwear and greg norman collection businesses depends on many factors  including the popularity and success of the licensing sports league and the licensed brands 
we have no assurance that the nfl  the nba or any other brand that we license will continue to generate a high level of interest in the products they license us to sell  or that our arrangements with any sports league will continue to enhance the reebok brand 
our revenues and profits may be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain license agreements on terms that are favorable to us  or if any of our license agreements is terminated 
the license agreements under which we design  market and sell licensed products bearing third parties brands may require us to pay substantial minimum royalty guarantees that in come cases could exceed our actual sales 
in addition  the terms of our license agreements vary and under some circumstances such agreements are subject to early termination by the licensing party 
in the event that we are not able to maintain license agreements on terms that are favorable to us  or if any of our license agreements is terminated  our revenues and profits may be adversely affected 
our business is subject to economic conditions in our major markets 
such factors include  without limitation  recession  inflation  general weakness in retail markets and changes in consumer purchasing power and preferences 
adverse changes in such economic factors could have a negative effect on our business 
our financial position  cash flow or results may be adversely affected by the threat of terrorism and related political instability and economic uncertainty 
the threat of potential terrorist attacks on the united states and throughout the world and the attendant political instability has created an atmosphere of economic uncertainty in the united states and in foreign markets 
our results may be impacted by the macroeconomic effects of those events 
a disruption in our supply chain as a result of such actions may significantly affect our business and its prospects 
in addition  such events may also result in heightened domestic security and higher costs for importing and exporting shipments of components and finished goods 
any of these occurrences may have a material adverse effect on our financial position  cash flow or results in any reporting period 
our sales and profitability may be adversely affected if our investments in advertising and marketing and our athlete endorsements and athletic sponsorships do not have the effect of increasing retailer acceptance and consumer purchases of our products 
because consumer demand for athletic footwear and apparel is heavily influenced by brand image  our business requires substantial investments in marketing and advertising  as well as athlete endorsements  athletic sponsorships and retail presence 
in the event that these investments do not achieve the desired effect of increasing consumer purchases and retailer acceptance of our products  our sales and profitability may be adversely affected 
our international sales and manufacturing operations are subject to the risks of doing business abroad  which could affect our ability to sell or manufacture our products in international markets  obtain products from foreign suppliers or control the cost of our products 
we operate facilities and sell products in numerous countries outside the united states 
additionally  a substantial portion of our products are manufactured abroad and we have suppliers located in china  indonesia  thailand and vietnam 
our athletic footwear and apparel sales and manufacturing operations are subject to the risks of doing business abroad 
these risks include fluctuations in currency exchange rates  political instability  limitations on conversion of foreign currencies into us dollars  restrictions on dividend payments and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries  withholding and other taxes on dividend payments and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries  import duties  tariffs  quotas and other restrictions on free trade  particularly as these regulations may affect our operations in china  hyperinflation in some foreign countries  and investment regulation and other restrictions by foreign governments 
if these risks limit or prevent us from selling or manufacturing products in any significant international market  prevent us from acquiring products from our foreign suppliers or significantly increase the cost of our products  our operations could be seriously disrupted until alternative suppliers are found or alternative markets are developed 
although we may enter into forward currency exchange contracts and options to hedge the risk of exchange rate fluctuations  these steps may not fully protect us against this risk and we may incur losses 
a strengthening united states dollar reduces our reported results of operations from our international business 
in we derived approximately of our revenue from sales in foreign currencies 
in our consolidated financial statements we translate local currency financial results into us dollars based on average exchange rates prevailing during a reporting period 
during times of a strengthening us dollar  our reported gross margins for merchandise purchased in us dollars and sold in other currencies may be negatively impacted 
our business may be adversely affected if we experience logistical difficulties in connection with the implementation of our european strategic plan  or if we encounter complications in connection with our european implementation of sap information management software 
under our european strategic plan we are implementing an integrated  regionalized approach to reebok s operations across europe 
this plan is designed to enable us to achieve operating efficiencies  improve logistics and reduce expenses 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will be able to effectively execute this plan or that such benefits will be achieved 
in addition  we may experience difficulties in product delivery or other logistical operations as a result of our implementation of this plan  which could have an adverse effect on our business 
we could be subject to increased expenditures and charges because of inefficiencies resulting from our implementation of this plan 
in addition  over the next few years we plan to implement sap information management software in all of reebok s european operations 
the implementation of such software could be delayed and we may encounter complications in connection with such implementation that could have an adverse effect on our business 
because we rely on independent manufacturers to produce most of our products  our sales and profitability may be adversely affected if our independent manufacturers fail to meet pricing  product quality and timeliness requirements or if we are unable to obtain some components used in our products from limited supply sources 
we depend upon independent manufacturers to manufacture our products in a timely and cost efficient manner while maintaining specified quality standards 
in our largest independent manufacturer accounted for approximately of our total footwear production 
we also rely upon the availability of sufficient production capacity at our manufacturers 
additionally  it is essential that our manufacturers deliver our products in a timely manner because our orders are cancelable by customers if agreed upon delivery windows are not met 
a failure by one or more of our manufacturers to meet established criteria for pricing  product quality or timely delivery could adversely impact our sales and profitability 
in addition  some of the components used in our products are obtained from only one or two sources 
a loss of one of these supply sources could disrupt and delay production and adversely affect our sales and profitability 
we have substantial existing debt and may incur additional debt in the future 
we have substantial amounts of outstanding indebtedness 
our substantial level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay the principal of  interest on and other amounts due in respect of our indebtedness when due 
we may also obtain additional long term debt and working capital lines of credit to meet future financing needs  which would have the effect of increasing our total leverage 
our substantial leverage could have significant negative consequences  including increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  limiting our ability to obtain additional financing  requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness  thereby reducing the amount of our cash flow available for other purposes  including capital expenditures  limiting our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industries in which we compete  and placing us at a possible competitive disadvantage with less leveraged competitors and competitors that may have better access to capital resources 
in addition  our lending arrangements restrict our ability to incur liens and require that we maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio and debt to adjusted earnings ratio 
our failure to comply with these requirements could result in a default that  if not cured or waived  could cause our lenders to refuse to extend us credit or require us to repay these borrowings before they are due 
our competitive position could be harmed if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights 
we believe that our trademarks  patents  technologies and designs are of great value 
from time to time third parties have challenged  and may in the future try to challenge  our ownership of our intellectual property 
in addition  our business is subject to the risk of third parties counterfeiting our products or infringing on our intellectual property rights 
we may need to resort to litigation in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights 
this litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources 
our failure to protect our intellectual property rights  and in particular the loss of the reebok  rockport  ralph lauren  greg norman  nfl or nba trademark rights  could have an adverse impact on our business and our competitive position 
we may not be able to realize the full value of our deferred tax assets 
we have approximately million of net deferred tax assets  of which approximately million  after reduction by the associated valuation allowance  is attributable to the expected utilization of tax loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards 
our ability to realize the carrying value of these deferred tax assets will depend on several factors including the level of taxable income we generate  the countries in which taxable income is generated  and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies 
if our estimates of future taxable income are not realized in the near term  the carrying value of the deferred tax assets and our future net income could be reduced

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations due to its international sales  production and funding requirements 
in the normal course of business  the company employs established policies and procedures to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates and fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies using a variety of financial instruments 
it is the company s policy to utilize financial instruments to reduce risks where internal netting and other strategies cannot be effectively employed 
the company s objective in managing its exposure to interest rate changes is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives the company primarily uses interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes related to its portfolio of borrowings

the company has used forward exchange contracts and options as an element of its risk management strategy for several years 
the company s objective in managing the exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility associated with foreign exchange rate changes 
the company enters into forward exchange contracts and options to hedge its exposure for merchandise purchased in us dollars that will be sold to customers in other currencies 
the company also uses foreign currency exchange contracts and options to hedge significant assets and liabilities denominated in other currencies 
accordingly  these contracts change in value as foreign exchange rates change to protect the value of these assets  liabilities and merchandise purchases

the foreign currency rate analysis assumed that each foreign currency rate would change by in the same direction relative to the us dollar on all financial instruments 
based on the results of these analyses of the company s financial instruments  a basis point adverse change in interest rates from year end levels would reduce the fair value of the interest rate swaps by million  and a adverse change in foreign currency rates would reduce the fair value of the forward currency exchange contracts and options by million

at december   the interest rate on the swap agreement was 
this interest rate swap agreement was designated as a fair value hedge of the million debentures maturing september  and met the shortcut method requirements under statement of financial accounting standards no 
the change in fair value of the interest rate swap agreement was exactly offset by the change in fair value of the debentures 
in october the company cancelled this swap resulting in a gain of million 
in accordance with sfas  the gain will be realized over the remaining life of the underlying debt 
at december  and  the notional amount of interest rate swap agreements outstanding was million 
net losses in other comprehensive income on december  of million  subject to subsequent fair market value adjustments of the derivatives  will be reclassified into earnings during the next twelve months when hedged transactions or cash flows materialize 
interest expense in  and would not have been materially different if these swap agreements had not been used 
foreign exchange forwards and options as of december   the maximum length of time over which the company was hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for forecasted transactions  excluding those forecasted transactions related to the payment of variable interest on existing financial instruments  was thirteen months 
net losses in other comprehensive income at december  of million  subject to subsequent fair market value adjustments of the derivatives  will be reclassified into earnings during the next twelve months when hedged transactions or cash flows materialize 
during the twelve months ended december   realized losses of million from currency rate hedges were recorded in costs of goods sold 
foreign currency gains losses realized from settlements of transactions included in other expenses  net  for the years ended december   and were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
there was no hedge ineffectiveness in or at december   the company had option and forward currency exchange contracts  all having maturities of less than thirteen months  with a notional amount aggregating million 
the contracts involved eight different foreign currencies  of which the euro and british pound currencies represented and  respectively  of the aggregate notional amount
