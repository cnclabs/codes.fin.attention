item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview simmons first national corporation recorded record earnings of  or diluted earnings per share for the twelve month period ended december  these earnings reflect an increase of  or per share from the december  earnings of  or diluted earnings per share 
the increase in earnings over last year is primarily attributable to the increased volume in the company s mortgage banking operation  a nonrecurring gain on the sale of mortgage servicing  growth in the loan portfolio  and a lower provision for loan losses  which correlates to the improved asset quality ratios 
the company s return on average assets and return on average stockholders equity for the year ended december   was and  compared to and  respectively  for the year ended at december   the company s loan portfolio totaled billion  which is a million  or a  increase from the same period last year 
this increase is due partially to the recently completed acquisition of nine branches in north central and northeast arkansas during the fourth quarter of  which included million in loans 
the additional growth was attributable to increased loan demand the company experienced in its construction and commercial real estate loan portfolios 
as of december  asset quality remained strong with non performing loans lower by  from the same period last year 
non performing loans to total loans improved to from from the same period last year  and the allowance for loan losses improved to of non performing loans  compared to from the same period last year 
at year end  the allowance for loan losses equaled of total loans  which is an improvement of basis points from the reflected at year end total assets for the company at december   were billion  an increase of million  or  over the same figure at december  stockholders equity at december   was million  a million  or  increase from december  upon completion of the recently announced acquisitions  simmons first national corporation  a financial holding company  will have assets of approximately billion  with eight community banks in pine bluff  lake village  jonesboro  rogers  searcy  russellville  el dorado  and hot springs  arkansas 
the company s eight banks will conduct financial operations from offices  of which are financial centers  in communities 
critical accounting policies overview management has reviewed its various accounting policies 
based on this review  management believes the policies most critical to the company are the policies associated with its lending practices including the accounting for the allowance for loan losses  treatment of goodwill  recognition of fee income  estimates of income taxes  and employee benefit plan as it relates to stock options 
loans loans the company has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or pay offs are reported at their outstanding principal adjusted for any loans charged off and any deferred fees or costs on originated loans and unamortized premiums or discounts on purchased loans 
interest income is reported on the interest method and includes amortization of net deferred loan fees and costs over the estimated life of the loan 
generally  loans are placed on non accrual status at ninety days past due and interest is considered a loss  unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection 
discounts and premiums on purchased residential real estate loans are amortized to income using the interest method over the remaining period to contractual maturity  adjusted for anticipated prepayments 
discounts and premiums on purchased consumer loans are recognized over the expected lives of the loans using methods that approximate the interest method 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is established as losses are estimated to have occurred through a provision for loan losses charged to income 
loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed 
subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to the allowance 
the allowance is maintained at a level considered adequate to provide for potential loan losses related to specifically identified loans as well as probable credit losses inherent in the remainder of the loan portfolio that have been incurred as of period end 
this estimate is based on management s evaluation of the loan portfolio  as well as on prevailing and anticipated economic conditions and historical losses by loan category 
general reserves have been established  based upon the aforementioned factors and allocated to the individual loan categories 
allowances are accrued on specific loans evaluated for impairment for which the basis of each loan  including accrued interest  exceeds the discounted amount of expected future collections of interest and principal or  alternatively  the fair value of loan collateral 
the unallocated reserve generally serves to compensate for the uncertainty in estimating loan losses  including the possibility of changes in risk ratings and specific reserve allocations in the loan portfolio as a result of the company s ongoing risk management system 
a loan is considered impaired when it is probable that the company will not receive all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan 
this includes loans that are delinquent days or more  nonaccrual loans and certain other loans identified by management 
certain other loans identified by management consist of performing loans with specific allocations of the allowance for loan losses 
specific allocations are applied when quantifiable factors are present requiring a greater allocation than that established using the classified asset approach  as defined by the office of the comptroller of the currency 
accrual of interest is discontinued and interest accrued and unpaid is removed at the time such amounts are delinquent days  unless management is aware of circumstances which warrant continuing the interest accrual 
interest is recognized for nonaccrual loans only upon receipt and only after all principal amounts are current according to the terms of the contract 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets of acquired subsidiaries and branches 
financial accounting standards board statement no 
and no 
eliminated the amortization for these assets as of january  although goodwill is not being amortized  it is tested annually for impairment 
fee income periodic bankcard fees  net of direct origination costs  are recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the period the fee entitles the cardholder to use the card 
origination fees and costs for other loans are being amortized over the estimated life of the loan 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax effects of differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
a valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
employee benefit plans the company has a stock based employee compensation plan 
the company accounts for this plan under recognition and measurement principles of apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
no stock based employee compensation cost is reflected in net income  as all options granted under those plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the grant date 
acquisitions on october   the company announced the execution of a definitive agreement under the terms of which  alliance bancorporation  inc abi will be merged into simmons first national corporation 
abi owns alliance bank of hot springs  hot springs  arkansas with consolidated assets of approximately million 
the transaction is expected to close during the first quarter of after the merger  alliance will continue to operate as a separate community bank with the same board of directors  management and staff 
on november   the company completed the purchase of nine financial centers from union planters bank  na six locations in north central arkansas include clinton  marshall  mountain view  fairfield bay  leslie and bee branch 
three locations in northeast arkansas communities include hardy  cherokee village and mammoth spring 
the nine locations have combined deposits of million with acquired assets of million including selected loans  premises  cash and other assets 
as a result of this transaction  the company recorded additional goodwill and core deposits of  and  respectively on july   the company expanded its coverage in south arkansas with the purchase of the monticello location from heartland community bank 
simmons first bank of south arkansas  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  acquired the monticello office 
as of july   the new location had total loans of million and total deposits of million 
as a result of this transaction  the company recorded additional goodwill and core deposits of  and  respectively 
sale of mortgage servicing during the second quarter  the company recorded a nonrecurring addition to earnings per share 
on june   the company sold its billion residential mortgage servicing portfolio 
as a result of this sale  the company established a reserve for potential liabilities due to certain representations and warranties made on the sale date 
the time period for making claims under the terms of the mortgage servicing sale s representations and warranties expired on june  thus  the company reversed this remaining reserve in the second quarter of  which is reflected in the  pre tax gain on sale of mortgage servicing 
excluding this nonrecurring gain  the company would have reported diluted earnings per share for the year ended december  net interest income net interest income  the company s principal source of earnings  is the difference between the interest income generated by earning assets and the total interest cost of the deposits and borrowings obtained to fund those assets 
factors that determine the level of net interest income include the volume of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  yields earned and rates paid  the level of non performing loans and the amount of non interest bearing liabilities supporting earning assets 
net interest income is analyzed in the discussion and tables below on a fully taxable equivalent basis 
the adjustment to convert certain income to a fully taxable equivalent basis consists of dividing tax exempt income by one minus the combined federal and state income tax rate of 
throughout  the federal reserve bank steadily decreased the federal funds rate by a total of basis points to in an effort to stimulate economic growth 
in  the federal reserve continued to decrease the federal funds rate from at the end of to at the end of this decline has continued in  with another basis point decrease  bringing the federal funds rate to at december  this declining rate environment contributed to the decline in interest income 
this decline was more than offset by a decline in interest expense  driven by the low interest rate environment  which resulted in growth in net interest income 
the company s practice is to limit exposure to interest rate movements by maintaining a significant portion of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities in short term repricing 
historically  approximately of the company s loan portfolio and approximately of the company s time deposits have repriced in one year or less 
these historical amounts are consistent with current repricing 
for the year ended december   net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis was million  an increase of million  or  from the same period in the increase in net interest income was the result of an million decrease in interest income and a million decrease in interest expense 
as a result  the net interest margin decreased basis points to for the year ended december   when compared to for the million decrease in interest income for the year ended december   primarily is the result of a basis point decrease in the yield earned on earning assets associated with the lower interest rate environment 
the lower interest rates resulted in a million decrease in interest income 
more specifically  million of the decrease is associated with the repricing of the company s loan portfolio that resulted from loans that matured during the period or were tied to a rate that fluctuated with changes in market rates 
as a result  the average rate earned on the loan portfolio decreased basis points from to 
offsetting the decline in interest rates for was growth in the company s loans portfolio 
the loan growth contributed million of additional interest income for versus the million decrease in interest expense for the year ended december   primarily is the result of a basis point decrease in cost of funds  due to repricing opportunities during the lower interest rate environment 
more specifically  million of the decrease is associated with management s ability to reprice the company s time deposits that resulted from time deposits maturing during the period or were tied to a rate that fluctuated with changes in market rates 
as a result  the average rate paid on time deposits decreased basis points from to 
for the year ended december   net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis was million  an increase of million  or  from the same period in the increase in net interest income was the result of a million decrease in fully taxable equivalent interest income and a million decrease in interest expense 
the decrease in interest income was the result of a lower yield earned on earning assets 
the decrease in interest expense was the result of a lower cost of funds 
the net interest margin improved basis points to for the year ended december   when compared to for the same period in the year ended represents the first full year that the company was able to fully utilize the changes in the arkansas usury law made possible through the gramm leach bliley act  which was upheld by the eighth circuit court of appeals in october this ability to reprice the loan portfolio  coupled with the ongoing repricing of the deposit base that was driven by the federal reserve s lowering of interest rates  enabled the company to achieve considerable improvement in both net interest income and net interest margin

the provision for  and was  and million  respectively 
the decrease in the provision for loan losses for reflects the improvement in the company s asset quality ratios from on a historical note  during the reporting year ended  the company experienced an increase in classified assets at one community bank subsidiary 
thus  the company increased the provision for loan losses at that subsidiary during the year ended while the company s asset quality improved during  there continued to be significant uncertainties in the united states economy and concerns over the downturn in the catfish industry that affects one of the company s community banks 
for that reason  management continued with an increased level of provision during non interest income total non interest income was million in  compared to million in and million in non interest income is principally derived from recurring fee income  which includes service charges  trust fees and credit card fees 
non interest income also includes income on the sale of mortgage loans and investment banking profits

the increase in trust fees is the result of general improvement in market conditions 
the increase in service charges was primarily the result of growth in transaction accounts 
the decrease in credit card fees was the result of a decline in the number of cardholders in the credit card portfolio  due to continuing competitive pressure in the credit card industry

this increase was attributable to the growth in service charges on deposit accounts offset by the decease in trust fees and credit card fees 
the increase in service charges on deposit accounts for is the result of an improved fee structure 
the decrease in trust fees was primarily the result of lower market valuations in the managed assets of the trust company  which was driven by the downturn in the market conditions in the united states 
the decrease in credit card fees is the result of increased competitive pressures for that product  which has resulted in a decline of the company s credit card portfolio 
during the years ended december  and  combined income on the sale of mortgage loans and income on investment banking increased  and  respectively  from the years ended in and the increases were the result of a higher volume for those products during and the lower interest rate environment during and primarily drove the volume increases 
the company records several items in other income 
the primary increase in other income was from an increase of the premiums received on the sale of student loans that moved into repayment status 
non interest expense non interest expense consists of salaries and employee benefits  occupancy  equipment  foreclosure losses and other expenses necessary for the operation of the company 
management remains committed to controlling the level of non interest expense  through the continued use of expense control measures that have been installed 
the company utilizes an extensive profit planning and reporting system involving all affiliates 
based on a needs assessment of the business plan for the upcoming year  monthly and annual profit plans are developed  including manpower and capital expenditure budgets 
these profit plans are subject to extensive initial reviews and monitored by management on a monthly basis 
variances from the plan are reviewed monthly and  when required  management takes corrective action intended to ensure financial goals are met 
management also regularly monitors staffing levels at each affiliate  to ensure productivity and overhead are in line with existing workload requirements 
non interest expense for was million  an increase of million or  from the increase in non interest expense during  compared to is primarily attributed to the increase in salary and employee benefits combined with the increase in credit card expenses 
the salary and employee benefits increase is associated with normal salary adjustments and the increased cost of health insurance 
the credit card expense increase was primarily attributable the company s airline miles reward program 
the current year ended was the company s third year in this program  which is typically the time frame when cardholders have accumulated enough miles to begin exercising their accrued miles 
based on continuing analysis of projected air miles usage  the company increased the estimated liability associated with this program by  in  of which  was accrued during the fourth quarter of non interest expense for was million  an increase of  or  from the relatively flat non interest expense is primarily due to the increase in salary and employee benefits offset by the decrease in the amortization of goodwill and other intangibles

loan portfolio the company s loan portfolio averaged billion during and billion during as of december   total loans were billion  compared to billion on december  the most significant components of the loan portfolio were loans to businesses commercial loans and commercial real estate loans and individuals consumer loans  credit card loans and single family residential real estate loans 
the company seeks to manage its credit risk by diversifying its loan portfolio  determining that borrowers have adequate sources of cash flow for loan repayment without liquidation of collateral  obtaining and monitoring collateral  providing an adequate allowance for loan losses and regularly reviewing loans through the internal loan review process 
the loan portfolio is diversified by borrower  purpose and industry and  in the case of credit card loans  which are unsecured  by geographic region 
the company seeks to use diversification within the loan portfolio to reduce credit risk  thereby minimizing the adverse impact on the portfolio  if weaknesses develop in either the economy or a particular segment of borrowers 
collateral requirements are based on credit assessments of borrowers and may be used to recover the debt in case of default 
the company uses the allowance for loan losses as a method to value the loan portfolio at its estimated collectible amount 
loans are regularly reviewed to facilitate the identification and monitoring of deteriorating credits 
consumer loans consist of credit card loans  student loans and other consumer loans 
consumer loans were million at december   or of total loans  compared to million  or of total loans at december  the consumer loan decrease from to is the result of a decline in credit cards and indirect lending  which was partially offset by an increase in student loans 
the consumer market  particularly credit card and indirect lending  continues to be one of the company s greatest challenges 
the credit card portfolio continued its decline as the result of an on going decrease in the number of cardholder accounts  due to competitive pressure in the credit card industry 
the decline in the indirect consumer loan portfolio was the result of the on going special finance incentives from car manufacturers and the impact of arkansas s usury law on indirect lending 
the increase in student loans was a result of greater demand for that product 
real estate loans consist of construction loans  single family residential loans and commercial loans 
real estate loans were million at december   or of total loans  compared to million  or of total loans at december  the real estate loan increase is the result of the acquisition of nine financial centers during the fourth quarter of combined with an improved demand for real estate loans 
commercial loans consist of commercial loans  agricultural loans and financial institution loans

the subsidiary banks recognize income principally on the accrual basis of accounting 
when loans are classified as nonaccrual  the accrued interest is charged off and no further interest is accrued 
loans  excluding credit card loans  are placed on a nonaccrual basis either when there are serious doubts regarding the collectability of principal or interest  or when payment of interest or principal is days or more past due and either i not fully secured or ii not in the process of collection 
if a loan is determined by management to be uncollectable  the portion of the loan determined to be uncollectable is then charged to the allowance for loan losses 
credit card loans are classified as impaired when payment of interest or principal is days past due 
litigation accounts are placed on nonaccrual until such time as deemed uncollectable 
credit card loans are generally charged off when payment of interest or principal exceeds days past due  but are turned over to the credit card recovery department  to be pursued until such time as they are determined  on a case by case basis  to be uncollectable

there was no interest income on the nonaccrual loans recorded for the years ended december   and a loan is considered impaired when it is probable that the company will not receive all amounts due according to the contracted terms of the loans 
impaired loans include non performing loans loans past due days or more and nonaccrual loans and certain other loans identified by management that are still performing 
at december   impaired loans were million compared to million in the increase in impaired loans from december   primarily relates to the increase of borrowers that are still performing  but for which management has internally identified as impaired 
this increase is the result of three borrowers that was internally classified by management as substandard  which offset the removal of one agricultural credit during the year 
furthermore  management has evaluated the underlying collateral on these commercial real estate credits and has allocated specific reserves to cover potential losses 
also  management has evaluated the underlying collateral on the remaining impaired loans and has allocated specific reserves in order to absorb potential losses if the collateral were ultimately foreclosed 
in conclusion  at this time  management does not view the downgrading of these particular credits as a trend in the company s overall portfolio 
thus  while impaired loans did increase from year end  the company views asset quality ratios as improved when compared to the same period last year 
allowance for loan losses overview the company maintains an allowance for loan losses 
this allowance is created through charges to income and maintained at a sufficient level to absorb expected losses in the company s loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is determined monthly based on management s assessment of several factors such as historical loss experience based on volumes and types  reviews or evaluations of the loan portfolio and allowance for loan losses  trends in volume  maturity and composition  off balance sheet credit risk  volume and trends in delinquencies and non accruals  lending policies and procedures including those for loan losses  collections and recoveries  national and local economic trends and conditions  concentrations of credit that might affect loss experience across one or more components of the loan portfolio  the experience  ability and depth of lending management and staff and other factors and trends  which will affect specific loans and categories of loans 
as the company evaluates the allowance for loan losses  it is categorized as follows specific allocations  allocations for classified assets with no specific allocation  general allocations for each major loan category and miscellaneous allocations 
specific allocations specific allocations are made when factors are present requiring a greater reserve than would be required when using the assigned risk rating allocation 
as a general rule  if a specific allocation is warranted  it is the result of an analysis of a previously classified credit or relationship 
the evaluation process in specific allocations for the company includes a review of appraisals or other collateral analysis 
these values are compared to the remaining outstanding principal balance 
if a loss is determined to be reasonably possible  the possible loss is identified as a specific allocation 
if the loan is not collateral dependent  the measurement of loss is based on the expected future cash flows of the loan 
allocations for classified assets with no specific allocation the company establishes allocations for loans rated watch through doubtful in accordance with the guidelines established by the regulatory agencies 
a percentage rate is applied to each category of these loan categories to determine the level of dollar allocation 
general allocations the company establishes general allocations for each major loan category 
this section also includes allocations to loans which are collectively evaluated for loss such as credit cards  one to four family owner occupied residential real estate loans and other consumer loans 
the allocations in this section are based on a historical review of loan loss experience and past due accounts 
the company gives consideration to trends  changes in loan mix  delinquencies  prior losses  and other related information 
miscellaneous allocations allowance allocations other than specific  classified and general for the company are included in the miscellaneous section 
this primarily consists of unfunded loan commitments

it is management s practice to review the allowance on a monthly basis to determine whether additional provisions should be made to the allowance after considering the factors noted above 
allocated allowance for loan losses the company utilizes a consistent methodology in the calculation and application of its allowance for loan losses 
because there are portions of the portfolio that have not matured to the degree necessary to obtain reliable loss statistics from which to calculate estimated losses  the unallocated portion of the allowance is an integral component of the total allowance 
although unassigned to a particular credit relationship or product segment  this portion of the allowance is vital to safeguard against the imprecision inherent when estimating credit losses 
during the year ended december   the company experienced an increase of million in the real estate allocation of the allowance for loan losses 
this increase is primarily associated the million increase in the real estate loan portfolio combined with three impaired borrowers in that product 
the increase in real estate loans is associated with the acquisition of nine branches during the fourth quarter of combined with the funding of outstanding real estate loan commitments 
concerning the three impaired borrowers  the two largest are still performing but were internally classified by management as substandard 
additionally  there is one borrower that is secured by commercial real estate that was previously classified as substandard but has been placed on nonaccrual status 
for the year ended december   the company has experienced a  increase in the allocation of the allowance for loan losses in the commercial loan category 
this increase is primarily due to internal classifications related to the catfish industry 
the change during in the allocation of the allowance for loan losses for credit cards and other consumer loans is consistent with the change in the outstanding loan portfolio for those products from december  the unallocated allowance increased million during the year ended this increase is primarily the result of the acquisition of nine branches with loans totaling approximately million 
as a result of this transaction the company recorded an addition to the allowance for loan losses of million 
because the company has not had enough experience with these loans to obtain reliable loss statistics from which to calculate estimated losses  management believes this addition was necessary to appropriately reflect the inherent risk of loss on this transaction based on losses experienced on previous acquisitions 
the company allocated approximately million of this addition in the unallocated portion of the allowance for loan losses until more experience with the acquired loans is obtained 
while the company still has some concerns over the uncertainty of the economy and the impact of foreign imports on the catfish industry in arkansas during  management believes the allowance for loan losses is adequate for the year ended december  in  management will actively monitor the status of the catfish industry in general as it relates to the company s loan portfolio specifically and make changes to the allowance for loan losses as necessary 
the company allocates the allowance for loan losses according to the amount deemed to be reasonably necessary to provide for losses incurred within the categories of loans set forth in table table allocation of allowance for loan losses december in thousands allowance amount of loans allowance amount of loans allowance amount of loans allowance amount of loans allowance amount of loans credit cards    other consumer    real estate    commercial    other unallocated     total    percentage of loans in each category to total loans

the company s general policy is not to invest in derivative type investments or high risk securities  except for collateralized mortgage backed securities for which collection of principal and interest is not subordinated to significant superior rights held by others 
held to maturity and available for sale investment securities were million and million  respectively  at december   compared to the held to maturity amount of million and available for sale amount of million at december  as of december   million  or  of the held to maturity securities were invested in us treasury securities and obligations of us government agencies  of which will mature in less than five years 
in the available for sale securities  million  or were in us treasury and us government agency securities  of which will mature in less than five years 
in order to reduce the company s income tax burden  an additional million  or  of the held to maturity securities portfolio  as of december   was invested in tax exempt obligations of state and political subdivisions 
in the available for sale securities  million  or were invested in tax exempt obligations of state and political subdivisions 
most of the state and political subdivision debt obligations are non rated bonds and represent relatively small  arkansas issues  which are evaluated on an ongoing basis 
there are no securities of any one state and political subdivision issuer exceeding ten percent of the company s stockholders equity at december  the company has approximately  or  in mortgaged backed securities in the held to maturity portfolio at december  in the available for sale securities  million  or were invested in mortgaged backed securities 
as of december   the held to maturity investment portfolio had gross unrealized gains of million and gross unrealized losses of gross realized gains of   and  resulting from sales and or calls of securities were realized for the years ended december   and  respectively 
gross realized losses of   and  resulting from sales and or calls of securities were realized for the years ended december   and  respectively 
trading securities  which include any security held primarily for near term sale  are carried at fair value 
gains and losses on trading securities are included in other income 
the company s trading account is established and maintained for the benefit of investment banking 
the trading account is typically used to provide inventory for resale and is not used to take advantage of short term price movements

the company s core deposits consist of all deposits excluding time deposits of  or more 
as of december   core deposits comprised of the company s total deposits 
the company continually monitors the funding requirements at each affiliate bank  along with competitive interest rates in the markets it serves 
because of the company s community banking philosophy  affiliate executives in the local markets establish the interest rates offered on both core and non core deposits 
this approach ensures that the interest rates being paid are competitively priced for each particular deposit product and structured to meet the funding requirements 
although interest rates are at historical lows  the company believes it is paying a competitive rate  when compared with pricing in those markets 
as a result  internal deposit growth and acquired deposits were million and million  respectively  for a total increase of million 
more specifically  total deposits as of december   were billion versus billion on december although the company lowered the interest rates on its time deposits  total time deposits increased million and million as a result of internal deposit growth and acquired deposits  respectively  to million from million at december  non interest bearing transaction accounts increased by million and million as a result of internal deposit growth and acquired deposits  respectively  to million compared to million at december  interest bearing transaction and savings accounts was million  which is a million and million increase as a result of internal deposit growth and acquired deposits  respectively  when compared to the million on december  the company will continue to manage interest expense through deposit pricing and does not anticipate a significant change in total deposits 
the company believes that additional funds can be attracted and deposit growth can be accelerated through deposit pricing if it experiences increased loan demand or other liquidity needs

management anticipates that these sources will provide necessary funding in the foreseeable future 
the company s general policy is to avoid the use of brokered deposits 
long term debt the company s long term debt was million and million at december  and  respectively 
the outstanding balance for december   includes million in long term debt  in fhlb long term advances and million of trust preferred securities 
the outstanding balance for december   includes million in long term debt  in fhlb long term advances and million of trust preferred securities 
during the year ended december   the company increased fhlb long term debt by million  or from december  the increase is a result of the company increasing the federal home loan bank borrowings in its community banking network 
the company made this strategic decision to better manage interest rate risk on specific new loan fundings and commitments made during on december   the company completed a private placement of trust preferred securities in an aggregate principal amount of  presently  the funds raised from the offerings will qualify as tier i capital for regulatory purposes  subject to the applicable limit  with the balance qualifying as tier ii capital 
the transaction was structured as a placement of three separate securities  each in an aggregate principal amount of million  maturing in december and interest payable on a quarterly basis  on the following terms a floating rate million security bears interest at a floating rate of above the three month libor rate  reset quarterly  and is callable in five years without penalty 
a floating fixed rate million security bears interest at a fixed rate of during the first seven years and at a floating rate of above the three month libor rate  reset quarterly  thereafter and is callable in seven years without penalty 
a fixed rate million security bears interest at a fixed rate of during the year term and is callable in five years without penalty 
the company used million of the net proceeds of the offerings to retire interim financing received in connection with the fourth quarter acquisition of nine banking branches 
the remaining proceeds will be used to finance the million cash portion of the consideration to be paid by the company in its pending merger with alliance bancorporation with the remainder for general corporate purposes 
the financial accounting standards board recently issued and revised interpretation no 
fin revised  consolidation of variable interest entities  which is effective for the first reporting period ending after march  fin revised requires deconsolidation of trusts in trust preferred structures upon adoption of fin revised 
the primary impact of this change will be to report the company s subordinated debt to the trust as long term debt rather than trust preferred securities  as is currently presented 
after adopting fin revised  this change will increase the company s long term debt and total assets by approximately million  while having no impact on stockholders equity or net income 
the company will make this change prospectively

capital represents shareholder ownership in the company the book value of assets in excess of liabilities 
at december   the company s equity to asset ratio was compared to at year end stock split on may   the company completed a two for one stock split by issuing one additional share to shareholders of record as of april  as a result of the stock split  the accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect an increase in the number of outstanding shares of common stock and the transfer of the par value of these additional shares from surplus 
all share and per share amounts have been restated to reflect the retroactive effect of the stock split  except for the capitalization of the company 
stock repurchase the company has a stock repurchase program  which is authorized to repurchase up to  common shares 
under the repurchase program  there is no time limit for the stock repurchases  nor is there a minimum number of shares the company intends to repurchase 
the company may discontinue purchases at any time that management determines additional purchases are not warranted 
the shares are to be purchased from time to time at prevailing market prices  through open market or unsolicited negotiated transactions  depending upon market conditions 
the company intends to use the repurchased shares to satisfy stock option exercise  payment of future stock dividends and general corporate purposes 
during the year ended december   the company repurchased  common shares of stock with a weighted average repurchase price of per share 
as of december   the company has repurchased a total of  common shares of stock with a weighted average repurchase price of per share 
upon completion of the current plan  the company expects to renew the repurchase program 
all information on the stock repurchase plan has been adjusted for the two for one stock split  which was distributed to shareholders effective may  cash dividends the company declared cash dividends on its common stock of per share split adjusted for the twelve months ended compared to per share split adjusted for the twelve months ended in recent years  the company increased dividends no less than annually and presently plans to continue with this practice 
parent company liquidity the primary sources for payment of dividends by the company to its shareholders and the share repurchase plan are the current cash on hand at the parent company plus the future dividends received from the seven affiliate banks 
payment of dividends by the seven affiliate banks is subject to various regulatory limitations 
reference is made to item a liquidity and qualitative disclosures about market risk discussion for additional information regarding the parent company s liquidity 
risk based capital the company s subsidiaries are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that  if undertaken  could have a direct material effect on the company s financial statements 
under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  the company must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the company s assets  liabilities and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
the company s capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components  risk weightings and other factors 
quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the company to maintain minimum amounts and ratios set forth in the table below of total and tier capital as defined in the regulations to risk weighted assets as defined and of tier capital as defined to average assets as defined 
management believes that  as of december   the company meets all capital adequacy requirements to which it is subject 
as of the most recent notification from regulatory agencies  the subsidiaries were well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action 
to be categorized as well capitalized  the company and subsidiaries must maintain minimum total risk based  tier risk based and tier leverage ratios as set forth in the table 
there are no conditions or events since that notification that management believes have changed the institutions categories

examples of these commitments include but are not limited to long term debt financing  operating lease obligations  unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit 
the company s long term debt at december   includes note payable  fhlb long term advances and trust preferred securities 
all of which the company is contractually obligated to repay in future periods 
operating lease obligations entered into by the company are generally associated with the operation of a few of the company s financial centers located throughout the state of arkansas 
the financial obligation by the company on these locations is not considered material due to the limited number of financial centers  which operate under an agreement of this type 
commitments to extend credit and letters of credit are legally binding  conditional agreements generally having fixed expiration or termination dates 
these commitments generally require customers to maintain certain credit standards and are established based on management s credit assessment of the customer 
the commitments may expire without being drawn upon 
therefore  the total commitment does not necessarily represent future requirements

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk liquidity and market risk management parent company the company has leveraged its investment in subsidiary banks and depends upon the dividends paid to it  as the sole shareholder of the subsidiary banks  as a principal source of funds for dividends to shareholders  stock repurchases and debt service requirements 
at december   undivided profits of the company s subsidiaries were approximately million  of which approximately million was available for the payment of dividends to the company without regulatory approval 
in addition to dividends  other sources of liquidity for the company are the sale of equity securities and the borrowing of funds 
banking subsidiaries generally speaking  the company s banking subsidiaries rely upon net inflows of cash from financing activities  supplemented by net inflows of cash from operating activities  to provide cash used in investing activities 
typical of most banking companies  significant financing activities include deposit gathering  use of short term borrowing facilities  such as federal funds purchased and repurchase agreements  and the issuance of long term debt 
the banks primary investing activities include loan originations and purchases of investment securities  offset by loan payoffs and investment maturities 
liquidity represents an institution s ability to provide funds to satisfy demands from depositors and borrowers  by either converting assets into cash or accessing new or existing sources of incremental funds 
a major responsibility of management is to maximize net interest income within prudent liquidity constraints 
internal corporate guidelines have been established to constantly measure liquid assets  as well as relevant ratios concerning earning asset levels and purchased funds 
the management and board of directors of each bank subsidiary monitor these same indicators and make adjustments as needed 
at december   each subsidiary bank was within established guidelines and total corporate liquidity remains strong 
at december   cash and cash equivalents  trading and available for sale securities and mortgage loans held for sale were of total assets  as compared to at december  liquidity management the objective of the company s liquidity management is to access adequate sources of funding to ensure that cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers are met in an orderly and timely manner 
sources of liquidity are managed so that reliance on any one funding source is kept to a minimum 
the company s liquidity sources are prioritized for both availability and time to activation 
the company s liquidity is at the forefront of not only funding needs  but is an integral part of asset liability management 
pricing of the liability side is a major component of interest margin and spread management 
adequate liquidity is a necessity in addressing this critical task 
there are six primary and secondary sources of liquidity available to the company 
the particular liquidity need and timeframe determine the use of these sources 
the first source of liquidity available to the company is federal funds 
federal funds  primarily from downstream correspondent banks  are available on a daily basis and are used to meet the normal fluctuations of a dynamic balance sheet 
in addition  the company and its affiliates have approximately million in federal funds lines of credit from upstream correspondent banks that can be accessed  when needed 
in order to ensure availability of these upstream funds  the company has a plan for rotating the usage of the funds among the upstream correspondent banks  thereby providing approximately million in funds on a given day 
historical monitoring of these funds has made it possible for the company to project seasonal fluctuations and structure its funding requirements on a month to month basis 
secondly  the company uses a laddered investment portfolio that insures there is a steady source of intermediate term liquidity 
these funds can be used to meet seasonal loan patterns and other intermediate term balance sheet fluctuations 
the company has begun designating a higher percentage of new investment purchases into the available for sale securities classification to provide additional flexibility in liquidity management 
during  the company modified the investment policy from a target of maintaining of total securities portfolio in afs to a new target of 
management believes that this new target level will facilitate the management of the company s overall liquidity 
as of december   approximately of the investment portfolio is classified as afs 
the company also uses securities held in the securities portfolio to pledge when obtaining public funds 
a third source of liquidity is the retail deposits available through the company s network of affiliate banks throughout arkansas 
although this method can be somewhat of a more expensive alternative to supplying liquidity  this source can be used to meet intermediate term liquidity needs 
fourth  the company has established a million unsecured line of credit with a major commercial bank that could be used to meet unexpected liquidity needs at both the parent company level as well as at any affiliate bank 
the fifth source of liquidity is the ability to access brokered deposits 
on an on going basis the company has chosen not to tap this source of funding 
however  for short term liquidity needs  it remains a viable option 
finally  the company s affiliate banks have lines of credit available with federal home loan bank 
while the company has used portions of those lines only to match off longer term mortgage loans  the company could use those lines to meet liquidity needs 
approximately million under these lines of credit are currently available  if needed 
the company believes the various sources available are ample liquidity for short term  intermediate term  and long term liquidity 
market risk management market risk arises from changes in interest rates 
the company has risk management policies to monitor and limit exposure to market risk 
in asset and liability management activities  policies are in place that are designed to minimize structural interest rate risk 
the measurement of market risk associated with financial instruments is meaningful only when all related and offsetting on and off balance sheet transactions are aggregated  and the resulting net positions are identified 
interest rate sensitivity interest rate risk represents the potential impact of interest rate changes on net income and capital resulting from mismatches in repricing opportunities of assets and liabilities over a period of time 
a number of tools are used to monitor and manage interest rate risk  including simulation models and interest sensitivity gap analysis 
management uses simulation models to estimate the effects of changing interest rates and various balance sheet strategies on the level of the company s net income and capital 
as a means of limiting interest rate risk to an acceptable level  management may alter the mix of floating and fixed rate assets and liabilities  change pricing schedules and manage investment maturities during future security purchases 
the simulation models incorporate management s assumptions regarding the level of interest rates or balance changes for indeterminate maturity deposits for a given level of market rate changes 
these assumptions have been developed through anticipated pricing behavior 
key assumptions in the simulation models include the relative timing of prepayments  cash flows and maturities 
in addition  the impact of planned growth and anticipated new business is factored into the simulation models 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain and  as a result  the models cannot precisely estimate net interest income or precisely predict the impact of a change in interest rates on net income or capital 
actual results will differ from simulated results due to the timing  magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes and changes in market conditions and management strategies  among other factors 
the table below presents the company s interest rate sensitivity position at december  this gap analysis is based on a point in time and may not be meaningful because assets and liabilities are categorized according to contractual maturities investment securities are according to call dates and repricing periods rather than estimating more realistic behaviors  as is done in the simulation models 
also  the gap analysis does not consider subsequent changes in interest rate level or spreads between asset and liability categories
