item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations preliminary note regarding forward looking statements the information set forth in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations below includes forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of  and is subject to the safe harbor created by that section 
factors that realistically could cause results to differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements are set forth in this section and earlier in this report under business factors that could affect future results beginning on page the following discussion should also be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto 
overview we design  develop  market and service high performance computer systems  commonly known as supercomputers 
these systems provide capability and capacity far beyond typical mainframe computer systems and address the world s most challenging computing problems for government  industry and academia 
our revenue  net income or loss and cash flow are likely to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter due to the high average sales price of our principal products and our general policy of not recognizing product revenue until customer acceptance 
in we completed hardware development of and began selling our cray x system  an extreme performance supercomputer designed for the high end of the supercomputer market 
we are developing enhancements to this system that will increase significantly processor speed and capability  which we call the cray xe system  with first shipments scheduled for the second half of in mid we began a development project with sandia national laboratories to design and deliver in a new  high bandwidth  massively parallel processing supercomputer system called red storm 
in october we announced that we would develop a product line based on the red storm system  targeting the need for highly scalable microprocessor based linux supercomputers with high bandwidth 
this product is scheduled for shipment in the second half of in mid we began work under a contract with darpa that supports our program to develop a commercially available system capable of sustained performance in excess of one petaflops  which we call our cascade program 
in february we announced a definitive agreement to acquire octigabay systems corporation  a privately held development stage company located in vancouver  bc octigabay is developing a balanced high bandwidth system designed to be highly reliable and easy to use that is targeted for the midrange market 
initial commercial shipments of the octigabay product are not expected until late  with full production ramp in we expect that most of our product revenue will come from sales of our cray x and cray xe systems  with additional contributions from the completion of the red storm project  continued work on the cascade project and sales of the commercial version of the red storm system 
we provide maintenance services to the worldwide installed base of cray computers 
we also offer high performance computing services that leverage our industry technical knowledge 
we experienced net losses in each full year of our operations prior to we incurred a net loss of million in for  we had net income of million and for we had net income of million including non recurring income items of a net million 
our fiscal year is the calendar year  and references to a particular year are to the year ended december of that year 
factors that should be considered in evaluating our business  operations and prospects and that could affect our future results and financial condition are set forth above under business factors that could affect future results 
critical accounting policies and estimates this discussion as well as disclosures included elsewhere in this annual report on form k are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingencies 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate the estimates used  including those related to estimates of warranty liabilities  deferred tax realizability  valuation of inventory at the lower of cost or market  the percentage complete and estimated gross profit on the red storm and cascade contracts  and impairment of goodwill 
we base our estimates on historical experience  current conditions and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources as well as identifying and assessing our accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies involve the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned 
we consider revenue realized or realizable and earned when it has persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the product has been shipped or the services have been provided to the customer  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
in addition to the aforementioned general policy  the following are the specific revenue recognition policies for each major category of revenue and for multiple element arrangements 
product 
we generally recognize revenue from product sales upon customer acceptance and when we have no unfulfilled obligations that affect the customer s final acceptance 
revenue from contracts that require us to design  develop  manufacture or modify complex information technology systems to a buyer s specifications  and to provide services related to the performance of such contracts  is recognized using the percentage of completion method for long term development projects 
percentage of completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date compared to the total estimated costs 
total estimated costs are based on several factors  including estimated labor hours to complete certain tasks and the estimated cost of purchased components at future dates 
estimates may need to be adjusted from quarter to quarter which would impact revenue and margins on a cumulative basis 
services 
service revenues for the maintenance of computers are recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance contract 
funds from maintenance contracts that are paid in advance are recorded as deferred revenue 
high performance computing service revenue is recognized as the services are rendered 
multiple element arrangements 
we enter into transactions that include multiple element arrangements  which may include any combination of services  hardware  and or software 
when some elements are delivered prior to others in an arrangement and all of the following criteria are met  revenue for the delivered element is recognized upon delivery and acceptance of such item 
otherwise  revenue is deferred until delivery of the last element 
vendor specific objective vsoe of fair value of the undelivered element 
the functionality of the delivered elements is not dependent on the undelivered elements 
delivery of the delivered element represents the culmination of the earnings process 
vsoe is the price we charge to an external customer for the same element when such element is sold separately and or management s established price list 
inventories we record our inventories at the lower of cost or market 
we regularly evaluate the technological usefulness of various inventory components 
when it is determined that previously inventoried components do not function as intended in a fully operational system  the costs associated with these components are expensed 
due to rapid changes in technology and the increasing demands of our customers  we are continually developing new products 
as a result  it is possible that older products we have developed may become obsolete or we may sell these products below cost 
when we determine that we will likely not recover the cost of inventory items through future sales  we write down the related inventory to our estimate of its market value 
although we did not write down any significant inventory for or  we recorded million of inventory write downs for because the products we sell have high average sales prices and because a high number of our prospective customers receive funding from us or foreign governments  it is difficult to estimate future sales of our products and the timing of such sales 
it also is difficult to determine whether the cost of our inventories will ultimately be recovered through future sales 
while we believe our inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market and that our estimates and assumptions to determine any adjustments to the cost of our inventories are reasonable  our estimates may prove to be inaccurate 
we have sold inventory previously reduced in part or in whole to zero  and we may have future sales of previously written down inventory 
we may also have additional expense to write down inventory to its estimated market value 
adjustments to these estimates in the future may materially impact our operating results 
goodwill approximately of our assets as of december   consisted of goodwill resulting from our acquisition of the cray research business unit from sgi in as discussed in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  we adopted sfas no 
on january   and we no longer amortize goodwill associated with the acquisition  but we will be required to conduct ongoing analyses of the recorded amount of goodwill in comparison to its estimated fair value 
we performed an annual impairment test effective january   and determined that our recorded goodwill was not impaired 
this analysis and ongoing analyses of whether the fair value of recorded goodwill is impaired will involve a substantial amount of judgment 
future charges related to goodwill could be material depending on future developments and changes in technology and our business 
in  we decreased goodwill by million due to the reversal of our valuation allowance for deferred tax assets 
see note federal income taxes  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
t reserve we acquired service contracts in the acquisition of the cray research business unit in april for cray t vector computers 
some of the components in the cray t vector computers have an unusually high failure rate 
as of april   the date of our acquisition of the cray research business unit from sgi  we recorded a warranty reserve of million  of which million reflected our estimate of the amount by which the cost of servicing the t vector computers would exceed the revenue generated from servicing them until they were no longer in use by our customers 
as we incur costs to service these computers in excess of the related service revenue  we reduce the amount of the t warranty reserve 
as of december   our total warranty reserve balance was  of which  related to the t vector computers 
we continually monitor the reasonableness of our estimate of the warranty reserve 
this involves analysis of our assumptions with regard to the length of time the t vector computers will be in use by our customers  the failure rate of modules in the computers considering actual historical failure rates  and personnel and resources  including service spares  that will be required to correct failures that occur in the future 
in determining the appropriate reserve  we reduced the t reserve and recorded a corresponding reduction to the cost of maintenance revenue of million and million for and  respectively 
we believe that the t warranty reserve balance at december   is a reasonable estimate of the extent to which our costs to service these computers will exceed the revenue generated from existing service contracts 
the most significant cost of maintenance is the amortization of t spare parts 
the quarterly amortization is million  and the spares will be fully amortized as of march  the t reserve will be almost fully utilized on march   with revenue on the few remaining t s then in service expected to cover the cost to maintain 
recent accounting pronouncements in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
amends and clarifies certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities under sfas no 
sfas no 
is effective for certain contracts entered into or modified by the company after june  the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
establishes standards for how the company would classify and measure financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity and requires the company to classify a financial instrument that is within the scope of sfas no 
as a liability or an asset in some circumstances 
sfas no 
also revises the definition of a liability to encompass obligations that the company can or must settle by issuing equity shares  depending on the nature of the relationship established between the company and a holder of its stock 
sfas no 
is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have an impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  which requires the consolidation of variable interest entities  as defined 
in december  the fasb issued fin revised  which deferred the effective date 
as revised  we are required to apply the provisions of fin in the first quarter of since we have no interests in special purpose entities  for which application would be required as of december  we do not expect to consolidate any variable interest entities upon the adoption of fin results of operations product revenue we had product revenue of million for  compared to million in and million in product revenue represented of total revenue for  compared to in and in the growth in product revenue in was principally due to the availability of the cray x system for the entire year as well as contributions from the red storm and cascade projects 
product revenue in prior years related principally to products we no longer market 
product revenue in was adversely impacted by delays in completing the svex enhancements 
we expect product revenue to grow in in both absolute amounts and as a percentage contribution to total revenue 
this revenue growth depends on continued sales of the cray x system  completion of the red storm project and the availability of the cray xe enhancements and the commercial version of the red storm system in the second half of we expect our product revenue to vary quarterly  perhaps significantly  with the second half of being stronger than the first half 
service revenue we had service revenue of million  including revenue from maintenance services of million for  compared to service revenue of million in and million in service revenue represented of total revenue for  in and for maintenance services are provided under separate maintenance contracts with our customers 
these contracts generally provide for maintenance services for one year  although some are for multi year periods 
maintenance service revenue has declined on an annual basis as older systems are withdrawn from service 
we expect the absolute amount of maintenance service revenue to continue to decline slowly over the next year as our older systems continue to be withdrawn from service and then to stabilize as our new systems are placed in service 
the decline in percentage contribution to total revenue is due to the significant increase in product revenue as new products and projects have become available as well as the decline in maintenance revenue 
operating expenses cost of product revenue 
we had cost of product revenue of million for compared to million in and million in our cost of product represented of product revenue for compared to in and in revenue for  and includes  million and million  respectively  from the sale of obsolete inventory recorded at a zero cost basis 
we anticipate lower overall product margins in than in due to the completion of the red storm project  which has minimum margins  increasing margin pressure on the cray x systems  particularly with the availability of the cray xe system  low margin contribution from the cascade project and the introduction of the commercialized version of the red storm product  which will be marketed in the more competitive massively parallel processor market 
we also may grant favorable pricing for large multi system contracts and to obtain strategic accounts 
cost of service revenue 
we had cost of service revenue of million for compared to million in and million in our cost of service revenue represented of service revenue for  compared to in and in in and  cost of maintenance revenue was favorably impacted by a million and a million  respectively reduction in warranty reserves 
in margins from maintenance revenue were adversely affected due to the withdrawal of legacy cray systems without a commensurate decrease in maintenance expenses and personnel 
as we reduce maintenance service personnel  cost of service is impacted adversely by associated severance expenses 
as we continue to experience declines in maintenance revenue before new shipments into the installed base offset retirements  we may continue to reduce maintenance service personnel and experience associated severance expenses 
we incurred million as a non recurring charge in the fourth quarter of related to severance charges in the service area as we attempted to anticipate these maintenance service revenue declines 
two factors will favorably impact the cost of service revenue the legacy spares will be fully amortized by the end of the first quarter  and the cost of servicing the cray t computers remaining in past the first quarter is not expected to exceed the associated service revenue 
maintenance costs should stabilize after the first quarter of at about of revenue 
research and development research and development expenses for  and reflect our costs associated with the development of the cray x system and in its enhancements and successors  and to a lesser extent  the cray mta in both the and periods  including related software development 
research and development expenses in also reflect our costs associated with the enhancements to the cray sv and te systems  including related software development 
research and development expenses also include personnel expenses  allocated overhead and operating expenses  software  materials and engineering expenses  including payments to third parties 
gross research and development expenses in the table below reflect all research and development expenditures  including expenses related to our research and development activities on the red storm and cascade projects 
the government funding reflects reimbursement by the government for development and services  including development of the cray x systems  enhancements and successors to the cray x system and other products  and our research and development personnel dedicated to the red storm and cascade projects 
the red storm and cascade research and development costs are reflected on our financial statements as cost of product revenue and the related reimbursements are recorded on our financial statements as product revenue 
research and development expenses for  and were as follows in thousands for the years ended december  gross research and development government funding net research and development net research and development expenditures represented   and of revenue for  and  respectively  as we have increased government funding and grown revenue 
we expect that gross and net research and development expenses will increase in as we continue the development of the cray xe system  continue our efforts on the cascade project and complete our work on the red storm project 
even assuming the completion of the octigabay acquisition and the associated increase in research and development expenses  we expect net research and development expenses to continue to decrease as a percentage of overall anticipated revenue as we expect to increase our overall revenue and to receive increased government funding 
marketing and sales marketing and sales expenses were million for  compared to million in and million as a percentage of revenue  marketing and sales expenses were  and for  and  respectively 
the increase in these expenses in was due to the roll out of the cray x product line  increased sales commissions due to higher sales activity and additional benchmarking and applications personnel 
we expect marketing and sales expenses to grow in line with anticipated increases in product revenue with the introduction of the cray xe systems and red storm products  increased sales commissions due to higher sales activity  continued emphasis on benchmarking and applications development and assuming the completion of the octigabay acquisition 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses were million for  compared to million in and million for general and administrative expenses were  and of revenue for  and  respectively 
the increase in these expenses in was due to costs associated with compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of  including increased accounting and legal expenses and new fees payable to our board of directors  increased premiums for directors and officers insurance  and legal costs and settlement expenses related to a patent litigation matter 
we expect general and administrative expenses to grow in as we add some personnel but  even assuming the completion of the octigabay acquisition  to decline slightly as a percentage of anticipated revenue 
restructuring charges restructuring charges were million in  compared to million in and million in of the amount  million represent severance expenses related to the termination of employees in  primarily associated with our service activities in europe and japan 
the remaining  charge in related to expensing certain technology that we plan to no longer use 
the charges in and represent severance expenses related to the termination of employees in and employees in goodwill we incurred no amortization expense in or  compared to million for the amortization expense relates to the goodwill resulting from the acquisition of the cray research business unit on april   and followed the governing accounting standards then in effect  which were changed with the implementation of statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
in  we decreased goodwill by million due to the reversal of the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets 
see note federal income taxes  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the effect of this accounting change is reflected prospectively from january  annually on january we test goodwill for impairment 
there was no goodwill impairment in or supplemental comparative disclosure as if the change had been retroactively applied in is as follows in thousands  except per share amounts year ended december  reported net income loss plus goodwill amortization adjusted net income loss reported basic net income loss per share reported diluted net income loss per share plus goodwill amortization adjusted basic net income loss per share adjusted diluted net income loss per share other income expense  net other income was million for and million for  compared to other expense of  for other income in consisted primarily of unrealized gains and losses from the effects of foreign currency exchange rates  while other income in primarily consisted of a negotiated settlement of an accrued cancellation charge on a purchase commitment 
interest income expense  net interest income was  for compared to  in and  in the interest income reflects our increased average cash position in following our public offering in february in which we raised million 
interest expense was  for compared to million for and million in the interest expense for reflects interest on our term loan for the first four months of the year and interest on our capital leases 
interest expense for was largely due to a non cash charge of million associated with the convertible debenture financing completed in november and  of interest paid on our term loan  line of credit and capital leases  while had non cash interest charges of  associated with the value of the conversion feature of certain investor promissory notes and  for the value of options  and just over million of interest paid on our term loan  line of credit and capital leases 
taxes we recorded an income tax benefit of million in as part of the reversal of the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets 
for and  we had an income tax provision of million and  respectively  primarily relating to income taxes in foreign countries and certain states 
there has been no provision for us federal income tax charges for any period because of our net operating loss carry forwards 
as of december   we had tax net operating loss carry forwards of approximately million that expire in years through  if not utilized 
net income loss net income was million for  compared to million for and a net loss of million for net income for was favorably impacted by the net effect of two non recurring items recognition of a tax benefit for reversal of the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of million  which was partially offset by a million restructuring charge 
without the non recurring items  net income would have been million 
the improvement in net income  as so adjusted  was due to increased product revenue  expenditures that grew less than the revenue growth  principally net research and development expenses  and  compared to  the absence of goodwill amortization charges 
liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and accounts receivable totaled million at december   compared to million at december  over that period  cash and cash equivalents increased from million to million  while short term investments increased from zero to million 
at december   we had working capital of million compared to million at december  in the first quarter of  we realized million of net proceeds from the public sale of our common stock 
net cash used by operating activities was million for  compared to million for and million for for net operating cash was used primarily by increases in accounts receivable and inventory and decreases in other accrued liabilities  warranty reserve and deferred revenues 
for net operating cash was used primarily by increases in accounts receivable and inventory and decreases in other accrued liabilities  warranty reserve and deferred revenues 
for net operating cash flows were primarily attributed to our net loss  offset by depreciation and amortization  along with decreases in accounts payable and warranty reserves 
net cash used by investing activities was million for  compared to million for and million for net cash used by investing activities for consisted of net purchases of million of short term investments following completion of our public offering of common stock and million of purchases of computers and electronic test equipment  computer software and furniture and fixtures 
net cash used by investing activities for consisted primarily of purchases of computers and electronic test equipment  computer software and furniture and fixtures 
in the net cash used in investing activities was primarily for electronic test equipment and computer hardware purchases 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for  compared to million for and million for the net cash provided by financing activities was primarily from our public offering  in which we received net proceeds of million  and million from warrant and stock option exercises 
we used million to retire our term loan debt 
in we raised million primarily through the sale of common stock and employee option exercises  and received another million through the exercise of warrants that otherwise would have expired 
in  we raised million through the sale of preferred stock to nec  and in november we issued million in convertible subordinated notes 
over the next twelve months  our significant cash requirements will relate to operational expenses  consisting primarily of personnel costs  costs of inventory and spare parts as we increase production of cray x systems and move to production of the cray xe system  completion of the octigabay acquisition  completion of the red storm project and introduction of the commercialized version of the red storm product  third party engineering expenses  and acquisition of property and equipment 
our fiscal year capital expenditure budget for property and equipment is estimated currently at million 
in addition  we lease certain equipment used in our operations under operating or capital leases in the normal course of business 
we expect that operations over the next twelve months will generate positive cash flow 
the following table is a summary of our contractual cash obligations as of december  in thousands payments due by periods less than after contractual obligations total year years years years development agreements capital lease obligations operating leases total contractual cash obligations at any particular time  given the high average selling price of our products  our cash position is affected by the timing of payment for product sales  receipt of prepaid maintenance revenue  receipt of government funding of research and development activities and the need to purchase inventory 
we believe our current cash resources will be adequate for the next twelve months 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk substantially all of our cash equivalents and marketable securities are held in money market funds or commercial paper of less than days that is held to maturity 
accordingly  we believe that the market risk arising from our holdings of these financial instruments is minimal 
we sell our products primarily in north america  but with significant sales in asia and europe 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
our products are generally priced in us dollars  and a strengthening of the dollar could make our products less competitive in foreign markets 
while we commonly sell products with payments in us dollars  our product sales contracts occasionally call for payment in foreign currencies and to the extent we do so  we are subject to foreign currency exchange risks 
we believe that a change in foreign exchange rates would not have a material impact on the financial statements 
our foreign maintenance contracts are paid in local currencies and provide a natural hedge against local expenses 
to the extent that we wish to repatriate any of these funds to the united states  however  we are subject to foreign exchange risks 
we do not hold any derivative instruments and have not engaged in hedging transactions
