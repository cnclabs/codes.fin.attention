item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations further explains the impacts of these conditions on our operating results 
factory built operations our factory built operations consist of production of manufactured homes and modular homes 
our manufactured homes are constructed in accordance with the federal manufactured home construction and safety standards hud regulations 
approximately of the homes we produced in fiscal were built to hud regulations 
the remaining of homes we produced were modular homes  which are built in accordance with state or local building codes 
the following table sets forth the total factory built homes sold as well as the number of manufacturing facilities we operated for the fiscal years indicated factory built homes sold single section multi section modular total factory built homes sold operating manufacturing facilities at end of fiscal year 
table of contents the principal materials used in the production of our factory built homes include wood  wood products  gypsum wallboard  steel  fiberglass insulation  carpet  vinyl  fasteners  appliances  electrical items  windows and doors 
we believe that the materials used in the production of our factory built homes are readily available from a wide variety of suppliers and the loss of any single supplier would not have a material adverse effect on our business 
the three suppliers which accounted for more than of our total purchases during the fiscal year ended march  represented only  and  respectively  of our total purchases during the fiscal year ended march  prices of certain materials such as lumber and gypsum can fluctuate significantly due to changes in supply and demand 
although we and others in the industry typically have been able to pass higher material costs on to the consumer through price increases  we were unable to do so fully in fiscal due to the competitive industry conditions 
no assurances can be made that we would be able to pass these costs on in future years either 
manufactured homes we manufacture single and multi section manufactured homes under various brand names including palm harbor  masterpiece  keystone  countryplace  river bend and windsor homes 
approximately of the manufactured homes we produced were multi section in fiscal as compared to in fiscal we offer over floor plans  ranging in size from approximately to  square feet 
approximately of the manufactured homes we produced are structurally or decoratively customized to the home buyer s specifications 
although we produce a wide price range of manufactured homes  the average retail sales price excluding land of our manufactured homes was approximately  at our fiscal year end 
our homes are manufactured in indoor facilities  which have approximately  square feet of floor space and employ an average of associates who generally work one shift per day  five days per week 
construction of our homes is performed in stages using an assembly line process 
each section is permanently attached to a steel support chassis  various components such as floors  interior and exterior walls and a roof are added and function testing is performed 
we currently manufacture a typical manufactured home in approximately five days 
our facilities have the capacity to produce an aggregate of approximately sections per day 
the current rate of production is our typical manufactured home contains two to five bedrooms  a living room  family room  dining room  kitchen  two or three bathrooms and features central air conditioning and heating  a range  refrigerator  carpeting and drapes 
in addition  we offer optional amenities  including dishwashers  washers  dryers  furniture packages and specialty cabinets  as well as a wide range of colors  moldings and finishes 
optional features usually associated with site built homes such as stone fireplaces  ceramic tile floors  showers and countertops  computer rooms  skylights  vaulted ceilings and whirlpool baths are also offered 
we have a unique package of energy saving construction features referred to as energmiser which includes  among other things  additional insulation to reduce heating and cooling costs  and which exceeds statutorily mandated energy efficiency levels 
we are constantly introducing new floor plans  decors  exteriors  features and accessories to appeal to different regions of the country and changing trends 
our manufactured homes are designed and copyrighted after extensive field research and consumer feedback 
we have developed engineering systems which  through the use of computer aided technology  permit customization of homes and assist with product development and enhancement 
the completed manufactured homes are transported by independent trucking companies to either the retail sales center or to the customer s site 
the transportation cost is borne by the independent retailer 
retailers or other independent installers are responsible for placing the manufactured home on site  joining the interior and exterior seams  making utility hook ups and  in certain instances  providing installation and finish out services 
the industry practice is to have third parties hired by the retailer provide the installation and finish out services 
our associates  rather than third parties  perform the finish out services on manufactured homes sold 
we believe our finish out services ensure that our quality procedures are applied during the entire process and increase customer satisfaction  thereby providing us a competitive advantage 
our backlog of manufactured housing orders as of april  was approximately million  as compared to approximately million as of june  since retailers may cancel orders prior to production without penalty  we do not consider our order backlog to be firm orders  however  such cancellations rarely occur 

table of contents because of the seasonality of the manufactured housing market  the level of backlog generally declines during the winter months 
modular homes we manufacture modular homes principally through our wholly owned subsidiary  nationwide custom homes  inc nationwide operates three facilities in martinsville  virginia  one in arabi  georgia  and one in siler city  north carolina 
in addition  certain of our other manufacturing facilities produce modular homes under the brand name discovery custom homes 
our modular homes include single story ranch homes  split levels and two and three story homes with a variety of floor plans and exteriors 
each modular home is assembled in sections 
the process begins on a production line where a team of assemblers creates the floor and walls of the house 
the section is then wheeled down a tracked path where various stages of finish are performed and components are added from wiring and insulation early in the process to fixtures and floor coverings just prior to shipping 
nationwide typically completes a modular home in seven to eight days 
the homes are shipped directly off the manufacturing line to the customer s site 
once on site  the homes are typically crane set on the foundation  the roof is raised and the final seam of roof shingles along the ridges of the roofline is applied 
our backlog of modular housing orders as of april  was approximately million  as compared to approximately million as of june  retail our homes are sold through a distribution network consisting of retail superstores we own  independent dealers  builders and developers 
the following table sets forth the number of homes we sold through each of these distribution channels  as well as the number of company owned retail superstores and independent dealers  builders and developers during the past three fiscal years march  march  march  factory built homes sold by company owned superstores and builder locations independent dealers  builders and developers total number of company owned superstores and builder locations independent dealers  builders and developers total we first established wholly owned superstores in and currently have superstores in states 
one of our typical retail superstores consists of a sales office  which is a manufactured home  and a variety of model homes of various sizes  floor plans  features and prices 
customers may purchase one of the model homes or may order a home that will be built at one of our manufacturing facilities and customized to meet their needs 
many of our retail superstores also sell used and repossessed homes 
through nationwide  we have five builder locations in virginia and north carolina 
our typical builder location consists of a modular home which serves as a sales office 

table of contents our independent retailer network principally consists of local dealers and builders that market land home packages and developers of communities 
no single independent retailer accounted for or more of our net sales during fiscal independent builders developers approximately of the modular homes we sold in fiscal were sold from our five nationwide manufacturing facilities directly to a consumer 
nationwide s independent distribution network consists of approximately local builders and developers with whom we have developed relationships through direct marketing  trade shows  the internet and referrals 
nationwide transports the home to the builder s developer s site and the builder developer contracts crews to lift the home with a crane onto its foundation and subsequently perform the finish out services 
modular homes typically require a larger amount of work to be done on site to complete the production of the homes 
currently six of our manufacturing facilities build modular homes and sell homes directly to builders developers 
markets served during the fiscal year ended march   the percentage of our revenues by region was as follows percentage of region primary states revenue by region southeast florida  north carolina  alabama  georgia  south carolina  mississippi  tennessee  virginia  west virginia  maryland central texas  oklahoma  arkansas  louisiana west new mexico  arizona  california  colorado  oregon  washington  montana  nevada  idaho midwest ohio  michigan  indiana  kentucky  illinois  pennsylvania the three states which accounted for greater than of our revenues were texas  florida and north carolina with  and respectively  of total revenues 
factory built housing  which consists of manufactured housing and modular housing  is a regional business and the primary geographic market is within a mile radius for a manufactured housing facility and within a one day drive for a modular housing facility 
each of our manufactured housing facilities typically serves to retailers  and the facility sales staff maintains personal contact with each retailer  whether company owned or independent 
our decentralized operations allow us to be more responsive in addressing regional customer preferences of product innovation and home design 
consumer financing we maintain relationships with conventional lenders who provide two basic types of consumer financing in the manufactured housing industry chattel or personal property loans for purchasers of a home with no real estate involved and land home or mortgage loans which finance the land  home and all improvements on the property 
there are two types of mortgage loans conforming and non conforming 
conforming loans conform to fha  va  freddie mac and fannie mae 
generally  the type of required foundations installed conform to federal requirements and the borrower must meet certain criteria 
non conforming loans are financed by a major bank or lending institution which does not require a specific foundation type and have more flexible criteria 
beginning in fiscal  many consumer lenders tightened credit underwriting standards which reduced lending volumes and resulted in lower sales volume of manufactured homes 
some of our customers obtain third party construction financing  which allows for progress payments to be made to us at periodic intervals during the manufacturing  sale and closing processes 
this type of financing is primarily available to those customers obtaining land home or mortgage loans  which finance the land  home and improvements on a piece of real property 
such third party construction financing through our customers is generally more advantageous to us in that generally the timing of cash receipts from our customers results in our obtaining floor plan financing for such home for a lesser average period of time  if at all 
we believe that our ability to provide financing to our customers on competitive terms improves our responsiveness to the financing needs of prospective purchasers and provides us with an additional source of earnings 
through countryplace  we offer customary chattel loans and non conforming land home mortgage loans for manufactured homes through our own retail superstores 
through bsm  we offer conforming and non conforming mortgage financing for both modular and manufactured homes 
prior to the third quarter of  countryplace originated loans and immediately sold them to other lenders 
during the third quarter of  we executed our planned strategy and expanded countryplace into a full 
table of contents service chattel lender with originating  servicing and securitization capabilities 
countryplace originated approximately million of loans for its own investment portfolio in fiscal countryplace services and collects its portfolio of loans using its own employees and systems 
insurance we offer property and casualty insurance as well as extended warranties for owners of manufactured homes through our subsidiary  standard casualty 
at the end of fiscal  standard casualty had approximately  policies in force and of homeowners who purchased a home through our own retail superstores purchased property and casualty insurance 
wholesale financing in accordance with manufactured housing industry practice  substantially all retailers finance a portion of their purchases of manufactured homes through wholesale floor plan financing arrangements 
under a typical floor plan financing arrangement  a financial institution provides the retailer with a loan for the purchase price of the home and maintains a security interest in the home as collateral 
the financial institution which provides financing to the retailer customarily requires us to enter into a separate repurchase agreement with the financial institution under which we are obligated  upon default by the retailer and under certain other circumstances  to repurchase the financed home at declining prices over the term of the repurchase agreement which generally ranges from to months 
the price at which we may be obligated to repurchase a home under these agreements is based upon our original invoice price plus certain administrative and shipping expenses 
our obligation under these repurchase agreements ceases upon the purchase of the home by the retail customer 
the risk of loss under such repurchase agreements is mitigated by the fact that i only of our homes are sold to independent retailers  ii a majority of the homes we sell to independent retailers are pre sold to specific retail customers  iii we monitor each retailer s inventory position on a regular basis  iv sales of our manufactured homes are spread over a large number of retailers  v none of our independent retailers accounted for more than of our net sales in fiscal  vi the price we are obligated to pay declines over time and vii we are  in most cases  able to resell homes repurchased from credit sources in the ordinary course of business without incurring significant losses 
we estimate that our potential obligations under such repurchase agreements were approximately million as of march  during the fiscal years ended march   march  and march   we incurred net expenses under these repurchase agreements totaling   and  respectively 
beginning in fiscal  lenient credit standards  which had facilitated increased industry wide wholesale shipments in previous years  tightened  resulting in declining wholesale shipments  declining margins and lower retail sales levels for most industry participants 
during this time  several major floor plan lenders have exited the wholesale financing business and a number of regional banks have entered the retail financing or increased their lending volumes 
competition the manufactured housing industry is highly competitive at both the manufacturing and retail levels  with competition based upon several factors  including price  product features  reputation for service and quality  depth of field inventory  promotion  merchandising and the terms of retail customer financing 
in addition  manufactured and modular homes compete with new and existing site built homes  as well as apartments  townhouses and condominiums 
the efficiency of the assembly line process  protection from the weather and nationwide purchasing power enable us to produce a home in less than a week and typically at a lower cost than a conventional site built home of similar quality 
we do not view any of our competitors as being dominant in the industry  although some of our competitors possess substantially greater manufacturing  distribution and marketing resources than us 

table of contents although many lenders to the manufactured housing industry have reduced their volume or gone out of business  there are still competitors to countryplace and bsm in the markets where we do business 
these competitors include national  regional and local banks  independent finance companies  mortgage brokers and mortgage banks 
none of these competitors is considered to be dominant or to have a material impact on the financing opportunities at countryplace or bsm 
business segment information we operate principally in two segments factory built housing  which includes manufactured housing  modular housing and retail operations and financial services  which includes finance and insurance 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report for information on our retail sales  income loss from operations  identifiable assets  depreciation and amortization expense and capital expenditures by segment for fiscal  and government regulation our manufactured homes are subject to a number of federal  state and local laws  codes and regulations 
construction of manufactured housing is governed by the national manufactured housing construction and safety standards act of  as amended the home construction act 
in  the department of housing and urban development hud issued regulations under the home construction act establishing comprehensive national construction standards 
the hud regulations  known collectively as the federal manufactured home construction and safety standards  cover all aspects of manufactured home construction  including structural integrity  fire safety  wind loads  thermal protection and ventilation 
such regulations preempt conflicting state and local regulations on such matters  and are subject to continual change 
our manufacturing facilities and the plans and specifications of our manufactured homes have been approved by a hud certified inspection agency 
further  an independent hud certified third party inspector regularly reviews our manufactured homes for compliance with the hud regulations during construction 
failure to comply with applicable hud regulations could expose us to a wide variety of sanctions  including mandated closings of our manufacturing facilities 
we believe our manufactured homes meet or surpass all present hud requirements 
our modular homes are subject to state and or local codes with certification and regulation and we believe our modular homes meet all state and or local codes 
manufactured and site built homes are all typically built with some products that contain formaldehyde resins 
since february  hud has regulated the allowable concentrations of formaldehyde in certain products used in manufactured homes and requires manufacturers to warn purchasers as to formaldehyde associated risks 
the environmental protection agency and other governmental agencies have in the past evaluated the effects of formaldehyde 
we use materials in our manufactured homes that meet hud standards for formaldehyde emissions and believe we comply with hud and other applicable government regulations in this regard 
the transportation of factory built homes on highways is subject to regulation by various federal  state and local authorities 
such regulations may prescribe size and road use limitations and impose lower than normal speed limits and various other requirements 
our manufactured homes are subject to local zoning and housing regulations 
in certain cities and counties in areas where our homes are sold  local governmental ordinances and regulations have been enacted which restrict the placement of manufactured homes on privately owned land or which require the placement of manufactured homes in manufactured home communities 
such ordinances and regulations may adversely affect our ability to sell homes for installation in communities where they are in effect 
a number of states have adopted procedures governing the installation of manufactured homes 
utility connections are subject to state and local regulation and must be complied with by the retailer or other person installing the home 
our modular homes are also subject to local zoning regulations which govern the placement of homes 
certain of our warranties may be subject to the magnuson moss warranty federal trade commission improvement act  which regulates the descriptions of warranties on products 
the description and substance of our warranties are also subject to a variety of state laws and regulations 
a number of states require manufactured home producers to post bonds to ensure the satisfaction of consumer warranty claims 

table of contents a variety of laws affect the financing of the homes we manufacture 
the federal consumer credit protection act truth in lending and regulation z promulgated thereunder require written disclosure of information relating to such financing  including the amount of the annual percentage rate and the finance charge 
the federal fair credit reporting act also requires certain disclosures to potential customers concerning credit information used as a basis to deny credit 
the federal equal credit opportunity act and regulation b promulgated thereunder prohibit discrimination against any credit applicant based on certain specified grounds 
the real estate settlement procedures act and regulation x promulgated thereunder require certain disclosures regarding the nature and costs of real estate settlements 
the federal trade commission has adopted or proposed various trade regulation rules dealing with unfair credit and collection practices and the preservation of consumers claims and defenses 
installment sales contracts eligible for inclusion in a government national mortgage association program are subject to the credit underwriting requirements of the federal housing association 
a variety of state laws also regulate the form of the installment sale contracts or financing documents and the allowable deposits  finance charge and fees chargeable pursuant to installment sale contracts or financing documents 
our sale of insurance products is subject to various state insurance laws and regulations which govern allowable charges and other insurance practices 
our operations are also subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the generation  storage  handling  emission  transportation and discharge of materials into the environment 
governmental authorities have the power to enforce compliance with their regulations  and violations may result in the payment of fines  the entry of injunctions or both 
the requirements of such laws and enforcement policies have generally become more strict in recent years 
accordingly  we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance with environmental laws and enforcement policies

on june   we acquired nationwide custom homes  inc  a manufacturer and marketer of modular homes 
nationwide contributed million in revenues and million in income from operations in fiscal 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview we are one of the nation s leading manufacturers and marketers of factory built homes 
we market nationwide through vertically integrated operations  encompassing manufactured and modular housing  chattel and mortgage bank financing  as well as insurance 
as of march   we operated manufacturing facilities that sell homes through company owned retail superstores and builder locations and approximately independent retail dealers  builders and developers 
through our subsidiary  countryplace  we offer chattel and non conforming land home mortgages to purchasers of manufactured homes sold by company owned retail superstores 
through our investment as the sole limited partner in bsm  we offer conforming and non conforming mortgages for both modular and manufactured homes 
we also provide property and casualty insurance for owners of manufactured and modular homes through our subsidiary  standard casualty 
the manufactured housing industry has continued to face a very difficult operating environment as evidenced by the decline in industry shipments for calendar limited availability of retail and wholesale financing  increased levels of repossessions  excessive retail inventory levels and manufacturing capacity continued to impact our sales and operating results in fiscal additionally  our operating margins have been adversely affected by significant increases in materials costs which we have not been able to fully pass on to the customer through price increases due to competitive industry conditions 
despite this challenging backdrop  we have not closed any manufacturing facilities and we only closed nine company owned retail superstores bringing us to retail superstores and builder locations 
we continue to tightly manage receivables and new home inventory per retail superstore  which declined compared to a year ago 
floor plan payable per retail superstore has declined compared to a year ago 
although industry wide manufactured housing shipments for calendar were down approximately  our shipments declined only 
additionally  countryplace  standard casualty and bsm continued to be additive to our results of operations for fiscal with the limited availability of financing in the manufactured housing industry  in fiscal we executed our planned strategy to expand countryplace into a full service chattel lender with originating  servicing and securitization capabilities 
during fiscal  countryplace originated over million of loans to be held for investment on its balance sheet and is now servicing over million of loans 
these loans were funded through borrowings from its warehouse facility  as well as capital contributions and borrowings from us 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  countryplace entered into a new warehouse facility agreement with a financial institution providing for increased borrowing capacity 
see liquidity and capital resources below for additional information 
the largest impediment of our growth is financing for our retail customers which  if limited  could affect our sales volume 
additionally  obtaining funding for countryplace and obtaining wholesale financing are key risk factors that could impair the growth of our company 
although we cannot predict with any certainty when sustainable industry improvements will occur  we are continuing to position ourselves strategically for the future 
first  we are focusing on the introduction of our discovery homes series of modular homes  as we believe that modular housing will be a key driver of our future growth and profitability 
we continue to control our fixed expenses to enhance our competitive position as the industry begins to recover from this downturn

net sales increased to million in from million in net sales for the factory built housing segment increased million primarily due to modular sales which totaled million in fiscal versus million in fiscal  which was somewhat offset by a decrease in overall manufactured housing volume 
the volume of manufactured homes sold through our retail superstores declined while overall manufactured housing unit volume  which includes sales to independent retailers  declined in fiscal this decline in volume is partially offset by an increase in the average selling price of a new manufactured home to  in from  in this increase in average selling price resulted primarily from our passing higher materials costs on to the customer through price increases as well as a shift in product mix towards multi section manufactured homes  which constituted of our manufactured homes sold in  as compared to in fiscal  as customers are purchasing larger homes with more amenities 
the number of our retail superstores and builder locations decreased from at the end of fiscal to at the end of fiscal financial services revenue increased million  which consists of a million increase in interest income resulting from an increase in the loans held for investment from million at the end of fiscal to million at the end of fiscal  and a million increase in insurance revenues 
gross profit 
in fiscal  gross profit as a percentage of net sales declined to  or million  from  or million  in fiscal gross profit for the factory built housing segment decreased million

the percentage of factory built homes sold through our retail superstores and builder locations decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal gross profit for the financial services segment increased million due to the increase in net sales as explained above 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to in from in selling  general and administrative expenses decreased slightly to million in fiscal from million in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses for factory built housing decreased million in fiscal  which reflects a million decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses associated with nine fewer retail superstores and a focus on reducing fixed costs in fiscal offset by an increase of million due to selling  general and administrative expenses including months of nationwide s expenses in fiscal versus months in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses for financial services increased million primarily due to additional expenses related to the expansion of countryplace 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased to million in as compared to million in this decrease was primarily due to a million decrease in the average floor plan liability in fiscal coupled with a slight decrease in the prime interest rate from at the end of fiscal to at the end of fiscal equity in earnings of limited partnership 
equity earnings in limited partnership decreased to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal this million decrease was primarily due to our share of operating losses at bsm in the last half of fiscal resulting from a decline in the number of mortgage refinance originations and a decline in margins due to the timing differential between loans funded and loans sold to investors 
other income 
other income decreased to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal this slight decrease was due to a million decrease in interest income  million decrease in income earned on a real estate investment offset by an increase of million in gains on short term investments 
compared to net sales 
net sales decreased to million in as compared to million in net sales for the factory built housing segment decreased million primarily due to the reduction of retail financing available in the manufactured housing industry  partially offset by the addition of modular sales which totaled million in fiscal the volume of manufactured homes sold through our retail superstores declined while overall manufactured housing unit volume  which includes sales to independent retailers  declined in fiscal this decline in volume is partially offset by an increase in the average selling price of a new manufactured home to  in as compared to  in this increase in average selling price resulted from a slight shift in product mix towards multi section manufactured homes 
multi section manufactured homes represented of our manufactured homes sold in the number of our retail superstores and builder locations increased from at the end of fiscal to at the end of fiscal financial services net sales decreased million due to a decrease in the number of loans originated by countryplace  a million decrease in insurance revenues resulting from the decrease in volume of new homes sold  and a million decrease in investment income related to standard s investments

equity earnings in limited partnership increased to million in fiscal as compared to none in fiscal this million increase was due to our becoming a sole limited partner in bsm during the first quarter of fiscal other income 
other income decreased to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal this decrease was primarily the result of a million decrease in interest income in fiscal  a million decrease in income earned on a real estate investment in fiscal and a million loss on short term investments in fiscal liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents totaled million at march   up from million at march  during fiscal  net cash of million was provided by operating activities primarily from increased accounts payable and decreased trade receivables 
payables increased due to temporarily renegotiated payment terms with certain vendors and receivables decreased due to increased collection efforts 
at the beginning of fiscal  payment terms returned to original terms following countryplace s successful renegotiation of the warehouse facility 
net cash used in investing activities consisted of million used for originating loans at countryplace  offset by net sales of investments of million 
net proceeds from the warehouse facility of million were offset by payments of million on floor plan liabilities  and contributed to the million in net cash provided by financing activities 
countryplace originates loans with customers in connection with the customer purchase of our factory built homes 
loan originations related to this strategic investment in our customers is shown in our consolidated statement of cash flows as cash used in investing activities 
to the extent cash outflows related to loan originations are shown in our consolidated statement of cash flows as cash used in investing activities  cash inflows are shown in our consolidated statements of cash flows as cash provided by operating activities 
typically  for customer purchases of our factory built homes that are financed by countryplace  of the originated loan amount is borrowed by countryplace under its warehouse facility and is funded through our operations 
we have an agreement with a financial institution for an million syndicated floor plan facility expiring march  the advance rate for this facility is of manufacturer s invoice 
we have a second facility with another financial institution for million  which automatically renews annually on october unless a day notification of cancellation is received by the financial institution 
these facilities are used to finance a major portion of the new home inventory at our retail superstores and are secured by new home inventory and a portion of receivables from financial institutions 
the interest rates on the facilities are prime at march  or prime plus to for aged units  of which we had none as of march  under our floor plan arrangements 
these two floor plan facilities contain certain provisions regarding minimum financial requirements which we must maintain in order to borrow against the facilities 
as of march   we were in compliance with amended minimum financial requirements under the million facility 
however  we do not expect to be in compliance with the current covenants regarding funded debt to ebitda  minimum ebitda or minimum profitability during the next fiscal year 
accordingly  in april  we obtained a firm commitment from the lending institution for a new  year  million floor plan facility conditional only upon customary preparation and execution of the final written agreement being entered into between the lender and us 
the new floor plan facility will contain covenant requirements for minimum liquidity  tangible net worth  cash flow and profitability 
we expect to be in compliance with the covenants of this new facility during the next fiscal year 
at march   we were not in compliance with the covenants under the million facility  specifically the covenants for funded debt to ebitda  minimum ebitda or minimum profitability 
we have obtained a three month limited forbearance with respect to this million facility 
the limited forbearance limits  under certain conditions the financial institution from exercising its rights and remedies with respect to default under the 
table of contents terms of the floor plan agreement 
it is not a waiver of the financial institution s rights or remedies  does not obligate the financial institution to forbear on any type of default in the future and does not amend or waive any term or provision of the floor plan agreement  which continues unchanged and in full force and effect 
we do not expect to be in compliance with these covenants in the next fiscal year and are in the process of renegotiating the facility 
in the event we are not in compliance with any of our floor plan facility requirements in future periods  we would seek a waiver of any default from the lending institutions and  if no such waiver was obtained  maturities of outstanding debt could be accelerated 
we had million and million outstanding under these floor plan credit facilities at march  and march   respectively 
during the fourth quarter  countryplace entered into an agreement with a financial institution for a million warehouse facility to fund chattel loans originated by company owned retail superstores  replacing its previous warehouse facility 
the new facility is collateralized by specific receivables pledged to the facility and bears interest at the rate of libor at march  plus 
the facility terminates on march   however amounts outstanding under the facility are effectively settled and re borrowed on a monthly basis 
the facility provides for an advance of against the outstanding principal balance of eligible receivables as defined in the warehouse agreement 
the previous facility provided maximum funding of million  an advance rate of  an interest rate of libor plus and a one year term 
the new facility provides for an advance rate adjustment on march  as determined by the financial institution 
if the advance rate is lowered  countryplace may terminate the borrowing facility with no penalty 
if countryplace does not terminate the facility  it is obligated to pay the financial institution a fee of million on march  countryplace had outstanding borrowings under warehouse facilities of million and million as of march  and march   respectively 
the facility contains certain requirements relating to the performance and composition of the receivables pledged to the facility and certain financial covenants  which are customary in the industry 
as of march   both we and countryplace were in compliance with these requirements 
in connection with the warehouse borrowing facility  we agreed to fund in cash to countryplace  up to of each loan loss incurred 
during fiscal  we funded  to countryplace under this loss funding arrangement 
as countryplace continues to expand and draw down on its warehouse facility  we will fund of any additional loan originations 
should countryplace increase its borrowings under the facility to the maximum million  we will have to fund from other sources an additional million of these loan originations 
during the fiscal years ended march  and march   countryplace originated  net of financed loan points   and  of chattel loans  respectively 
of these amounts  in fiscal   of loan originations was funded by our operations and  was funded through warehouse borrowings  and in fiscal  of loan originations was funded by our operations and  was funded through warehouse borrowings 
countryplace currently intends to originate and hold loans for investment on a long term basis 
countryplace makes loans to borrowers that it believes are credit worthy based on its credit guidelines 
however  originating and holding loans for investment subjects countryplace to more credit and interest rate risk than the previous business practice of originating loans for resale 
the ability of customers to repay their loans may be affected by a number of factors and if customers do not repay their loans  the profitability and cash flow of the loan portfolio would be adversely affected 
countryplace intends to securitize its loan portfolio on a routine basis 
while we believe it will be able to obtain additional liquidity through the securitization of such loans  no assurances can be made that countryplace will successfully complete securitization transactions on acceptable terms and conditions  if at all 
we believe that cash flows from operations  together with floor plan financing and other available borrowing alternatives in addition to the warehouse facility  will be adequate to support our working capital needs  currently planned capital expenditure needs and expansion of countryplace for the foreseeable future 
however  because future cash flows and the availability of financing will depend on a number of factors  including prevailing economic and financial conditions  business  the market for asset backed securitizations  and other factors beyond our control  no assurances can be given in this regard 

table of contents contractual obligations and commitments dollars in thousands the following tables summarize our contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments  excluding interest  at march  for additional information related to these obligations  see the notes to consolidated financial statements 
payments due by period less than after total year years years years debt obligations floor plan payable warehouse revolving debt bonds payable operating lease obligations total contractual cash obligations amount of commitment expiration per period total amounts less than over committed year years years years repurchase obligations letters of credit total commercial commitments we have contingent repurchase obligations outstanding at march  which have a finite life but are replaced as we continue to sell our manufactured homes to dealers under repurchase agreements with financial institutions 
our losses related to these contingent repurchase obligations were   and  during fiscal   and  respectively 
for additional information on our repurchase obligations  see critical accounting policies reserve for repurchase obligations 
we have provided letters of credit to providers of certain of our insurance policies 
while the current letters of credit have a finite life  they are subject to renewal at different amounts based on the requirements of the insurance carriers 
we have recorded insurance expense based on anticipated losses related to these policies as is customary in the industry 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 

table of contents impairment of intangible assets 
in assessing the recoverability of our intangibles  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
revenue recognition 
retail sales  including shipping charges  are recognized when a down payment is received  the customer enters into a legally binding sales contract  title has transferred and the home is accepted by the customer  delivered and permanently located at the customer s site 
homes sold to independent retailers are recognized when the home is shipped which is when the title passes to the independent retailer 
the transportation cost is borne by the independent retailer 
warranties 
we provide the retail home buyer a one year limited warranty covering defects in material or workmanship in home structure  plumbing and electrical systems 
we record a liability for estimated future warranty costs relating to homes sold  based upon our assessment of historical experience factors 
factors we use in the estimation of the warranty liability include historical warranty experience related to the actual number of calls and the average cost per call 
although we maintain reserves for such claims based on our assessments as described above  which to date have been adequate  there can be no assurance that warranty expense levels will remain at current levels or that such reserves will continue to be adequate 
a large number of warranty claims exceeding our current warranty expense levels could have a material effect on our results of operations 
reserve for repurchase obligations 
manufactured housing companies enter into repurchase agreements with financial institutions which have provided wholesale floor plan financing to independent retailers 
these agreements generally provide that in the event of a retailer s default we will repurchase the financed home from the lending institution at declining prices over the term of the repurchase agreement generally months 
the risk of loss under such repurchase agreements is mitigated by the fact that i only of our homes are sold to independent retailers  ii a majority of the homes we sell to independent retailers are pre sold to specific retail customers  iii we monitor each retailer s inventory position on a regular basis  iv sales of our manufactured homes are spread over a large number of retailers  v none of our independent retailers accounted for more than of our net sales in fiscal  vi the price we are obligated to pay declines over time and vii we are  in most cases  able to resell homes repurchased from credit sources in the ordinary course of business without incurring significant losses 
allowance for loan losses 
countryplace originates and holds for investment purposes loans related to the retail sale of our manufactured homes  with such loans being collateralized primarily by the manufactured home 
we provide allowances for estimated future loan losses at the time of sale and during the term of the loan 
the allowance for loan losses gives consideration to the composition of the loan portfolio  including number of delinquencies and historical loss experience  and expectations as to future loan losses based upon industry knowledge 
although countryplace maintains an allowance for loan losses based upon these expectations and other criteria  future differences between countryplace s expectations with respect to loan losses and actual losses incurred in the portfolio could differ  and require countryplace to provide additional allowances 
new accounting pronouncements in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
effective march   we adopted sfas no 
which specifies the accounting for certain financial instruments that  under previous guidance  issuers could account for as equity 
this statement requires that qualifying instruments be classified as liabilities in statements of financial position 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
in  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin which requires the consolidation of variable interest entities  as defined  by the primary beneficiary of such entities 
in general  variable interest entities are entities that do not have  or are not subject to control through  voting interests 
the provisions of fin  as revised  were applicable to us for any interests in certain special purpose variable interest entities in the fourth quarter of fiscal for all other types of variable interest entities  the provisions of fin were applicable in our first quarter of fiscal we do not hold any investments in  or are the primary beneficiary of  any type of variable interest entity  and thus the adoption of fin did not have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 

table of contents securities and exchange commission sec staff views on sfas no 
members of the sec staff have recently advised us of their view that the origination and collection of long term loans  which are held for investment purposes  in connection with customer purchases of our products or services should be presented as an operating activity  rather than as an investing activity  in the consolidated statement of cash flows 
the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows have been prepared on a basis consistent with our established interpretations of sfas no 
and generally accepted accounting principles  including industry practice 
accordingly  the origination and collection of loans held for investment have been classified as an investing activity in the statement of cash flows 
alternatively  had we classified the origination and collection of loans held for investment as an operating activity  consistent with the view of members the sec staff discussed above  net cash provided by used in operating activities for the fiscal year ended march  and march  would have decreased to  and  respectively and net cash provided by used in investing activities for the fiscal year ended march  and march  would have increased to  and  respectively 
the sec staff has indicated they are going to continue to consider this matter  the final resolution of which may require us to reclassify our cash flows as currently presented 
forward looking information risk factors certain statements contained in this annual report are forward looking statements within the safe harbor provisions of the securities litigation reform act 
forward looking statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events and can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts 
investors should be aware that all forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and  as a result of certain factors  actual results could differ materially from these expressed in or implied by such statements 
these risks include such assumptions  risks  uncertainties and factors associated with the following financing for our retail customers may be limited  which could affect our sales volume 
our retail customers generally secure financing from third party lenders  which have been negatively affected by adverse loan experience 
conseco finance servicing corp 
and the associates  which had provided financing for our customers  have withdrawn from the manufactured housing finance business 
reduced availability of such financing is currently having an adverse effect on the manufactured housing business and our home sales 
availability of financing is dependent on the lending practices of financial institutions  financial markets  governmental policies and economic conditions  all of which are largely beyond our control 
quasi governmental agencies such as fannie mae and freddie mac  which are important purchasers of loans from financial institutions  have tightened standards relating to the manufactured housing loans that they will buy 
most states classify manufactured homes as personal property rather than real property for purposes of taxation and lien perfection  and interest rates for manufactured homes are generally higher and the terms of the loans shorter than for site built homes 
financing for the purchase of manufactured homes is often more difficult to obtain than conventional home mortgages 
there can be no assurance that affordable retail financing for manufactured homes will continue to be available on a widespread basis 
if third party financing were to become unavailable or were to be further restricted  this could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
if countryplace is unable to securitize its loans  it will be required to seek other sources of long term funding  which funding may not be available 
our wholly owned subsidiary  countryplace  originates chattel and non conforming land home mortgage loans that are funded with proceeds from its warehouse borrowing facility and borrowings from us 
we anticipate that a primary future source of funding for countryplace will be from securitizations of its mortgage loans 
the proceeds from the securitizations will be used to repay borrowings from the warehouse facility and from us  as well as to originate new loans 
the securitization market is dependent upon a number of factors  including general economic conditions  conditions in the securities market generally and conditions in the asset backed securities market specifically 
although the asset backed securitization market for manufactured housing lenders has improved slightly in the past year in terms of access to the markets  as well as pricing and credit enhancement levels  poor performance of any loans we may securitize in the future could harm our future access to the securitization market 
if countryplace is unable to securitize its loans on terms that are economical  or if there is a decline in the securitization market for manufactured housing lenders  and if countryplace is unable to obtain additional sources 
table of contents of long term funding  it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and business prospects 
if countryplace is unable to adequately and timely service its loans  it may adversely affect its results of operations 
although countryplace has originated loans since  it has limited loan servicing and collections experience 
in  it implemented new systems to service and collect the portfolio of loans it originates 
the management of countryplace has industry experience in managing  servicing and collecting loan portfolios  however  many borrowers require notices and reminders to keep their loans current and to prevent delinquencies and foreclosures 
a substantial increase in the delinquency rate that results from improper servicing or mortgage loan performance in general could adversely affect the profitability and cash flow from the loan portfolio in countryplace 
if countryplace s customers are unable to repay their loans  countryplace may be adversely affected 
countryplace makes loans to borrowers that it believes are creditworthy based on its credit guidelines 
however  the ability of these customers to repay their loans may be affected by a number of factors  including  but not limited to national  regional and local economic conditions  changes or continued weakness in specific industry segments  natural hazard risks affecting the region in which the borrower resides  and employment  financial or life circumstances 
if customers do not repay their loans  the profitability and cash flow from the loan portfolio could adversely affect countryplace and our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
reduced availability of wholesale financing may adversely affect our inventory levels of new homes 
we finance a portion of our new inventory at our retail superstores through wholesale floor plan financing arrangements 
through these arrangements  financial institutions provide us with a loan for the purchase price of the home 
after the departure of conseco finance servicing corp 
from wholesale financing  in  deutsche financial services corporation announced that they were exiting the floor plan financing business 
although we currently have floor plan facilities with financial institutions totaling million  there can be no assurance that we will continue to have access to such facilities or that we will not be forced to reduce our new home inventory at our retail superstores 
our repurchase agreements with floor plan lenders could result in increased costs 
in accordance with customary practice in the manufactured housing industry  we enter into repurchase agreements with various financial institutions pursuant to which we agree  in the event of a default by an independent retailer in its obligation to these credit sources  to repurchase manufactured homes at declining prices over the term of the agreements  typically months 
the difference between the gross repurchase price and the price at which the repurchased manufactured homes can then be resold  which is typically at a discount to the original sale price  is an expense to us 
thus  if we were obligated to repurchase a large number of manufactured homes in the future  this would increase our costs  which could have a negative effect on our earnings 
tightened credit standards by lenders and more aggressive attempts to accelerate collection of outstanding accounts with retailers could result in defaults by retailers and consequently repurchase obligations on our part may be higher than has historically been the case 
during fiscal and  net expenses incurred under these repurchase agreements totaled  and  respectively 
increased prices and unavailability of raw materials could have a material adverse effect on us 
our results of operations can be affected by the pricing and availability of raw materials 
in  we experienced an increase in prices of our raw materials of 
although we attempt to increase the sales prices of our homes in response to higher materials costs  such increases typically lag behind the escalation of materials costs 

table of contents three of the most important raw materials used in our operations  lumber  gypsum wallboard and insulation  have experienced significant price fluctuations in the past fiscal year 
although we have not experienced any shortage of such building materials today  there can be no assurance that sufficient supplies of lumber  gypsum wallboard and insulation  as well as other materials  will continue to be available to us on terms we regard as satisfactory 
we are dependent on our executive officers and the loss of their service could adversely affect us 
we are dependent to a significant extent upon the efforts of our executive officers  particularly lee posey  chairman of the board and larry h 
keener  president and chief executive officer 
the loss of the services of one or more of our executive officers could have material adverse effect upon our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our continued growth is also dependent upon our ability to attract and retain additional skilled management personnel 
we are controlled by two shareholders  who may determine the outcome of all elections 
approximately of our outstanding common stock is beneficially owned or controlled by our chairman of the board  lee posey and capital southwest corporation and its affiliates 
as a result  these shareholders  acting together  are able to determine the outcome of elections of our directors and thereby control the management of our business 
if inflation increases  we may not be able to offset inflation through increased selling prices 
if there is a material increase in inflation in the future  it is unlikely that we will be able to increase our selling prices to completely offset the material increase in inflation and as a result  our operating results may be adversely affected 
the manufactured housing industry is highly competitive and some of our competitors have stronger balance sheets and cash flow  as well as greater access to capital  than we do 
as a result of these competitive conditions  we may not be able to sustain past levels of sales or profitability 
the manufactured housing industry is highly competitive  with relatively low barriers to entry 
manufactured and modular homes compete with new and existing site built homes and to a lesser degree  with apartments  townhouses and condominiums 
competition exists at both the manufacturing and retail levels and is based primarily on price  product features  reputation for service and quality  retailer promotions  merchandising and terms of consumer financing 
some of our competitors have substantially greater financial  manufacturing  distribution and marketing resources than we do 
as a result of these competitive conditions  we may not be able to sustain past levels of sales or profitability 
our business is highly cyclical and there may be significant fluctuations in our quarterly results 
the manufactured and modular housing industry is highly cyclical and seasonal and has experienced wide fluctuations in aggregate sales in the past 
we are subject to volatility in operating results due to external factors beyond our control such as the level and stability of interest rates  unemployment trends  the availability of retail financing  the availability of wholesale financing  housing supply and demand  international tensions and hostilities  levels of consumer confidence  inventory levels  and changes in general economic conditions 
sales in our industry are also seasonal in nature  with sales of homes traditionally being stronger in the spring  summer and fall months 
the cyclical and seasonal nature of our business causes our revenues and operating results to fluctuate and makes it difficult for management to forecast sales and profits in uncertain times 
as a result 
table of contents of seasonal and cyclical downturns  results from any quarter should not be relied upon as being indicative of performance in future quarters 
we are concentrated geographically  which could harm our business 
in fiscal  of our revenues were generated in texas 
additionally  in fiscal  of our revenues were generated in florida and of our revenues were generated in north carolina 
a decline in the demand for manufactured housing in these three states and or a decline in the economies of these three states could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on our variable rate debt  which consists primarily of our liabilities under retail floor plan financing arrangements and warehouse revolving debt  and our fixed rate loans receivable balances 
we are not involved in any other market risk sensitive contracts or investments such as interest rate swaps  futures contracts  or other types of derivative financial instruments 
for variable interest rate obligations  changes in interest rates generally do not impact fair market value  but do affect future earnings and cash flows 
assuming our and countryplace s level of variable rate debt as of march  is held constant  each one percentage point increase in interest rates occurring on the first day of the year would result in an increase in interest expense for the coming year of approximately million 
for fixed rate loans receivable  changes in interest rates do not change future earnings and cash flows from the receivables 
however  changes in interest rates could affect the fair market value of the loan portfolio 
assuming countryplace s level of loans held for investment as of march  is held constant  a increase in average interest rates would decrease the fair value of countryplace s portfolio by approximately million 
this decrease in fair value is not linear to changes in interest rates and may or may not have any impact on the realizable amount of the receivables 
countryplace is exposed to market risk related to the accessibility and terms of financing in the asset backed securities market 
countryplace intends to securitize its loan portfolio as a means to obtain long term fixed interest rate funding 
the asset backed securities market for manufactured housing has been volatile during the past year 
the inability to securitize its loans would require countryplace to seek other sources of funding or to reduce or eliminate its loan originations if other sources of funding are not available
