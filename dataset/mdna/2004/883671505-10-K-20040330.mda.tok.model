overview we design  manufacture  sell and install custom vinyl replacement windows for residential and retail commercial customers 
we also sell and install replacement doors  home textured coatings  vinyl siding  patio decks  patio enclosures  cabinet refacings and kitchen and bathroom remodeling products as well as residential roofing 
our sector in the remodeling industry has been challenged by a number of material events a recession with lingering effects of the terrorist attacks of september   a stock market drop  and banks lenders being reluctant to extend consumer credit 
investor confidence shaken by corporate scandals 
the worst winter in ten years severely impacting operating results in the first quarter of the war in iraq 
new federal do not call legislation 
we have reported a revenue decline in each of the last four years 
the material events identified above are the primary reason for failing to meet our number one goal of increasing revenue in despite failing to increase revenue  has seen the following successes continued cost cutting and beneficial debt restructuring 
considerable progress toward a successful  optimal  best practices operating model including consolidation and or standardization of key elements of our business such as advertising  marketing  accounting  and our logo 
development of a new technologically superior extrusion process using state of the art ge plastics to be used in our window products 
because of the large  growing home improvement market  we believe thermoview has considerable opportunities in the future 
however  it is going to be vital for us to complete the best practices model that we have been diligently implementing 
complete the master job tracking system 
complete the loan finder software system to provide an effective means of locating ready financing sources for our customers 
complete introduction of the technologically superior compozit window extrusion at all of our window manufacturers by the end of open a number of streamlined  efficient  retail showrooms in smaller communities as a means of increasing volumes 
expanding our manufacturing facility to provide windows to some of our other retail locations in addition to providing windows to our north dakota retail operation 
the extent of response to our advertising  the closure rate experienced on our sales calls  and the expression of interest by financial institutions in providing consumer remodeling loans are all key indicators of trends in our business 
we are presently observing positive changes in each of these key indicators 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash and equivalents of  a working capital deficit of  million of long term debt  net of current maturities  and million of preferred stock subject to mandatory redemption 
the company s cash flows from operating activities  as detailed in the consolidated statements of cash flows  decreased significantly during  largely due to declining sales 
the company began the year with a cash balance of million  by the end of the third quarter that balance had decreased to  during  the company was in compliance with all debt covenants through the third quarter 
during the fourth quarter  management determined that the company would not be able to meet its cash obligations  or comply with the terms of its debt agreements  at december  and into accordingly  management entered into negotiations with its principal creditor  ge capital corporation ge  to restructure the cash flow and covenant requirements 
in the first quarter of  ge agreed to modify its agreements with the company  effective december  the new agreements allow the company to defer all payments of interest and principal until the fourth quarter of  at which time payments essentially equal to those in the prior agreement resume 
the new agreements also set new covenant requirements for see note 
the use of  of cash for investing activities for related primarily to the acquisition of property and equipment 
the use of  of cash for investing activities for also related primarily to the acquisition of property and equipment 
we used million in cash for financing activities in primarily for repayment of debt 
we used  of cash for financing activities in for repayment of debt and for establishing a sinking fund 
our cash flow could be negatively impacted by an adverse final determination in the nelson e 
clemmens litigation 
the adverse judgment could result in our requirement to pay  plus interest accrued from january  until paid 
we have recorded  as long term debt on our balance sheet  and have accrued interest amounting to  through december  we have appealed the latest decision 
on june   we restructured our long term debt and preferred stock 
ge equity holds series a debt  series c debt and other subordinated debt 
under the restructuring agreements  ge equity reduced the interest rate on both series of debt from to and from to on the subordinated debt 
additionally  ge equity converted million of the subordinated debt to  common stock warrants at cents per share 
these warrants are exercisable through march  and were determined to have a fair value of  ge equity extended thermoview s debt maturities two years to june   and to july  for the subordinated debt 
the holder of million of notes in connection with obligations related to guarantors of a bank revolving line of credit also agreed to extend the due date of the notes from june to september  thermoview s preferred stock holders also converted million worth of series d preferred stock to  common stock warrants at cents per share 
these warrants are exercisable through june  and were determined to have a fair value of  also  the series d and e preferred stock holders agreed to reduce the dividend rate on the remainder of the preferred holdings from to  to defer cash dividends until the series a and b debt is retired  and to extend the date for mandatory redemption to august  the june  debt restructuring contained revised terms as to principal repayment and the achievement of certain covenants and ratios 
we satisfied all ratios and covenants as of september  as discussed above  fourth quarter results necessitated revisions of scheduled principal repayments  covenants and ratios as defined in the june  restructuring 
accordingly  ge equity agreed to restate repayment terms and covenants and ratios as of december  as follows a thermoview must achieve certain quarterly and or trailing twelve month ebitda levels as well as fixed charge coverage ratios and current asset to current liability ratios 
the first measurement date for ebitda levels is june  and the first measurement date for fixed charge coverage ratios and current asset to current liability ratios is september  b interest can be deferred as additional principal on series a and b sub notes from december  through the third quarter of c interest can be deferred as additional principal on the series c sub note and the senior subordinated promissory note from october  through the third quarter of d principal repayments of  per month are required on the series a and b sub notes beginning november  e principal repayments on the series c sub note of  per month are required from april  through december  and  per month thereafter 
if we default in the future under our debt arrangements  the lenders can  among other items  accelerate all amounts owed and increase interest rates on our debt 
an event of default could result in the loss of our subsidiaries because of the pledge of our ownership in all of our subsidiaries to the lenders 
as of december   we are not in default under any of our debt arrangements 
while revenues and cash flow from operations continue to be lower than the previous year and economic and regulatory issues continue to challenge us  we believe that our cash flow from operations will allow us to meet our anticipated needs during at least the next months for debt service requirements under terms as revised as of december   sinking fund requirements securing the supercedeas bond for the clemmens litigation  working capital requirements  planned property and equipment capital expenditures  expanding our retail segment  offering new technologically improved products to our customers  and integrating more thoroughly the advertising and marketing programs of our regional subsidiaries into a national home remodeling business 
we do not expect annual capital expenditures for the next three years to significantly vary from amounts reported for the last three years  which have been in the range of  to  annually 
business segments our subsidiaries have separate management teams and operational structures and operate in two reportable operating segments retail and manufacturing 
retail 
our retail segment consists of our subsidiaries that design  sell and install custom vinyl replacement windows  doors and related home improvement products to commercial and retail customers 
our retail segment derives its revenues from the sale and installation of thermal replacement windows  storm windows and doors  patio decks  patio enclosures  vinyl siding and other home improvement products 
our retail segment recognizes revenues on the completed contract method 
a contract is considered complete when the home improvement product has been installed 
gross profit in the retail segment represents revenues after deducting product and installation labor costs 
manufacturing 
our manufacturing segment consists of our subsidiary that manufactures and sells vinyl replacement windows to one of our retail companies and to unaffiliated customers 
in  our manufacturing segment will increase due to sales to an additional retail location 
our manufacturing segment recognizes revenues when products are shipped 
gross profit in the manufacturing segment represents revenues after deducting product costs primarily glass  vinyl and hardware  window fabrication labor and other manufacturing expenses 
see note to consolidated financial statements for additional financial information about each of our business segments 
management s discussion of critical accounting policies the accounting policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical in understanding the company s financial statements because their application places the most demands on management s judgment  with financial reporting results relying on estimation about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
accounting for the impairment of long lived assets we evaluate our goodwill and other long term assets for impairment and assess their recoverability based upon anticipated future cash flows 
if facts and circumstances lead management to believe that the cost of one of our assets may be impaired  we will a evaluate the extent to which that cost is recoverable by comparing the future undiscounted cash flows estimated to be associated with the asset to the asset s carrying amount and b write down that carrying amount to market value or discounted cash flow value to the extent necessary 
revenue and cost recognition we recognize revenues from fixed price contracts on the completed contract method since the contracts are of a short duration 
a contract is considered complete when we have installed the home improvement product 
contract costs include all direct material and labor costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance such as indirect labor and supplies 
we charge general and administrative costs to expense as incurred 
we make provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts in the period in which such losses are determined 
other loss contingencies we record other loss contingencies as liabilities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
disclosure is required when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will exceed the recorded provisions 
contingent liabilities are often resolved over long term periods 
estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple forecasts that often depend on judgments about potential actions by third parties 
other significant accounting policies other significant accounting policies  not involving the same level of measurement uncertainties as those discussed above  are nevertheless important to an understanding of the financial statements 
policies related to consolidation policy  trade receivables  inventories and warranties require judgments on complex matters that are often subject to multiple sources of authoritative guidance 
also see footnote to our consolidated financial statements of this form k  organization and significant accounting policies  which discusses accounting policies that our management must select when there are acceptable alternatives

revenues decreased from million in to million in this revenue decrease of million is due primarily to fluctuations in revenues of our retail subsidiaries 
leingang  our north dakota retail subsidiary  reported million more revenue in compared to due to significant backlog caused by a severe hailstorm in june thermo shield  our chicago retail subsidiary  reported million less revenue in compared to this subsidiary continues to be underperforming following a change in its lead generation strategy  closure of several of its divisions  and change in subsidiary management 
thermoview s management is closely monitoring this subsidiary in an effort to improve its performance 
rolox  our kansas city  missouri  retail subsidiary reported million less revenue in compared to this subsidiary eliminated a customer sales incentive program in and experienced staff turnover which had an adverse impact on revenues 
gross profit 
gross profit decreased from million in to million in as a percentage of revenues  gross profit decreased from in to in the lower gross profit percentage in resulted from increased installation labor costs  increased insurance costs and increased other costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased from million in to million in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased from in  to in the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses in represents a concerted effort by management to reduce corporate and field expenses 
we have reduced salary expense  phone expense  and various other administrative costs 
unusual charges credits 
the unusual credit in represents a gain on forgiveness of debt in connection with the restructuring of debt in march the million unusual credit is net of expenses and net of  of value assigned to common stock purchase warrants issued in connection with the settlement reached with our former senior lender  pnc bank 
we have reclassified historical results of operations in to reflect this gain as an unusual credit rather than an extraordinary item to comply with new accounting rules 
depreciation expense 
depreciation expense decreased from million in to million in  reflecting relatively constant levels of property and equipment 
amortization expense 
amortization expense decreased from million in to  in this decrease results from the adoption of the new accounting standard relating to goodwill 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased from million in to million in this decrease results from the reduction of interest related to the elimination of nearly million of debt during the first quarter of in connection with a debt restructuring  a reduction in the stated interest rate on million of our debt  extended maturity dates on some of our debt which reduced the monthly amounts of accretion of debt discount  and debt retirements of million in the last half of income tax expense 
due to operating losses  management concluded that it was more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized 
accordingly  we established a valuation allowance against all deferred tax assets  and no deferred income taxes have been recorded in or income tax expense in relates to state income taxes 
income tax benefit in relates to some state tax refunds 
non cash dividends 
non cash dividends in and represent accrued dividends on the series d and e preferred stock 
benefit of series d stock redemption 
we redeemed  shares of series d preferred stock with a carrying amount of  for  from the prior owners of an acquired business 
we have reflected the excess of the carrying amount over the consideration given of  as a benefit of series d redemption in compared to revenues 
revenues decreased from million for to million for revenues in were negatively impacted by severe winter weather in our midwest markets in the first quarter  rain in our southern california market  the sluggish economy  the events in iraq  and new telemarketing laws 
all of our retail operations and our manufacturing operation reported less revenues in compared to gross profit 
gross profit  which represents revenues less cost of revenues earned  decreased from million in to million in the reduction in the amount of gross profit is consistent with the reduced revenue discussed above 
as a percentage of revenues  gross profit decreased from in to in this decrease results primarily because of more competitive pricing in certain markets and because certain installation costs at our subsidiaries are fixed and these fixed costs are more significant relative to the lower volumes in compared to selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased from million in to million in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue increased from in to in the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues in results primarily from the fixed nature of certain expenses relative to the lower volumes 
despite an increase in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue  we have reduced these expenses by million through purchasing programs and focused cost cutting

depreciation expense 
depreciation expense decreased from  in to  in  reflecting a fairly constant amount of property and equipment

for  interest expense on mandatorily redeemable preferred was  income tax benefit 
due to operating losses  management concluded that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will not be realized

non cash dividends in and the first six months of represent accrued dividends on the series d and e preferred stock 
for the last six months of  we reported non cash dividends as interest expense on mandatorily redeemable preferred see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for effect of statement 
benefit of series d preferred stock redemption 
the benefit of  in is used in determining net income attributable to common stockholders  and represents a gain on redemption of million of series d stock in exchange for  common stock warrants issued at cents per share 
disclosures about contractual obligations and commercial commitments payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations mandatorily redeemable preferred stock total joint venture in october  thermoview and royal group technologies limited formed a joint venture  which purchased certain assets consisting primarily of manufacturing equipment of complast  inc for  complast was a supplier of extruded components for the manufacture of window systems  originally located in minneapolis  minnesota 
the joint venture is located in winnipeg  manitoba  canada  in one of royal group s manufacturing plants 
under the terms of the agreement  thermoview owns percent of the joint venture and royal group owns percent 
additionally  thermoview agreed to purchase extrusions from the joint venture or an affiliate of the royal group for seven years  subject to meeting demand  being price competitive and meeting industry quality standards 
our interest in this joint venture is accounted for using the equity method 
the joint venture produces and sells extrusions consisting of composites of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene abs and other materials 
purchases by thermoview represented and of the joint venture s total revenue in and the joint venture s revenue approximated million in and million in pending litigation thermoview does not anticipate any significant adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows because of the pending litigation described in item  legal proceedings  except for the clemmens litigation 
although thermoview intends to vigorously defend the clemmens suit  an adverse outcome could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow 
inflation due to relatively low levels of inflation experienced during the years ended december    and inflation did not cause a significant increase in our costs 
seasonality historically  our results of operations have fluctuated on a seasonal basis 
we have experienced lower levels of sales and profitability during the period from mid november to mid march  impacting the first and fourth quarters of each year 
inclement weather conditions in the winter and spring months in our markets located in the north central united states  which limit our ability to install exterior home improvement products  reduces demand for windows  doors  vinyl siding and related products 
our intention is to expand our southern california markets and to enter other markets in the southern united states to reduce the impact of seasonality  if we have the available capital 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in june  we restructured our debt and  as a result  all of our debt is fixed rate debt 
interest rate changes would result in gains or losses in the market value of our fixed rate debt due to the differences between the current market interest rates and the rates governing these instruments 
with respect to our fixed rate debt currently outstanding  a change in interest rates for example  from to would not have resulted in a significant change in the fair value of our fixed rate debt
