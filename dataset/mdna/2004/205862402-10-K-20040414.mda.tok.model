research and development because of the continuing technological changes that characterize the telecommunications and computer industries  the company s success will depend  to a considerable extent  upon its ability to continue to develop competitive products through its research and development efforts 
the company currently employs more than  scientists  engineers and technicians in its research and development efforts  located predominantly in the united states and israel with additional offices in france  germany and malaysia  with broad experience in the areas of digital signal processing  computer architecture  telephony  ip  data networking  multi processing  databases  real time software design and application software design  among others 
a portion of the company s research and development operations benefit from financial incentives provided by government agencies to promote research and development activities performed in israel 
the cost of such operations is and will continue to be affected by the continued availability of financial incentives under such programs 
during the past fiscal year  the company s research and development activities included projects submitted for partial funding under a program administered by the office of the chief scientist of the ministry of industry and trade of the state of israel ocs  under which reimbursement of a portion of the company s research and development expenditures will be made subject to final approval of project budgets 
during the year ended january   comverse finalized an arrangement with the ocs under which comverse no longer would owe royalties to the ocs in return for a lump sum payment for all past amounts received from the ocs 
under the arrangement  comverse began to receive lower amounts from the ocs than it had historically received  but is not required to pay royalty amounts on such future grants 
other subsidiaries of cti were not part of comverse s arrangement with the ocs and they continue to owe royalties on their sale of certain products developed  in part  with funding supplied under such programs 
permission from the government of israel is required for the company to manufacture outside of israel products resulting from research and development activities funded under such programs  or to transfer outside of israel related technology rights  and in order to obtain such permission the company may be required to increase the royalties to the applicable funding agencies and or repay certain amounts received as reimbursement of research and development costs 
see financial statements in item  licenses and royalties and operations in israel in item and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item patents and intellectual property rights the company holds a number of united states and foreign patents 
while the company files patent applications periodically  no assurance can be given that patents will be issued on the basis of such applications or that  if patents are issued  the claims allowed will be sufficiently broad to protect the company s technology 
in addition  no assurance can be given that any patents issued to the company will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented or that the rights granted under the patents will provide significant benefits to the company 
in order to safeguard its unpatented proprietary know how  trade secrets and technology  the company relies primarily upon trade secret protection and non disclosure provisions in agreements with employees and others having access to confidential information 
there can be no assurance that these measures will adequately protect the company from disclosure or misappropriation of its proprietary information 
the company and its customers from time to time receive communications from third parties  including some of the company s competitors  alleging infringement by the company of such parties patent rights 
while such communications are common in the computer and telecommunications industries and the company has in the past been able to obtain any necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms  there can be no assurance that the company would prevail in any litigation to enjoin the company from selling certain of its products on the basis of such alleged infringement  or that the company would be able to license any valid patents on reasonable terms

service and support the company has a strong commitment to provide product service and support to its customers and emphasizes such commitment in its marketing 
because of the intensity of use of systems by telecommunications network operators and other customers of the company s products  and their low tolerance for down time  the company is required to make a greater commitment to service and support of systems used by these customers  and such commitment increases operating costs 
the company s general warranty policy is to replace or repair any component that fails during a specified warranty period 
broader warranty and service coverage is provided in many cases  and is sometimes made available to customers on a contractual basis for an additional charge

direct and or indirect competitors include  among others  alcatel  boston communications  ericsson  glenayre  huawei  ibm  intervoice  logicacmg  lucent  motorola  nokia  openwave  ss networks  tecnomen  telcordia  and unisys

other important competitive factors include service and support and the capability to integrate systems with a variety of telecom networks  ip networks and operation and support systems oss 
comverse believes that the range of capabilities provided by  and the ease of use of  its systems compare favorably with other products currently marketed 
comverse anticipates that a number of its direct and indirect competitors will introduce new or improved systems during the next several years 
verint faces strong competition in the markets for its products  both in the united states and internationally 
verint expects competition to persist and intensify in the security market  primarily due to increased demand for homeland defense and security solutions 
verint s primary competitors are suppliers of security and recording systems and software  and indirect competitors that supply certain components to systems integrators 
in the business intelligence market  verint faces competition from organizations emerging from the traditional call logging or call recording market as well as software companies that develop and sell products that perform specific functions for this market 
in addition  many of verint s competitors specialize in a subset of verint s portfolio of products and services 
primary competitors include  among others  eti  general electric  jsi telecom  nice systems  pelco  raytheon  sensormatic  ss networks  tyco  honeywell and witness systems 
verint believes it competes principally on the basis of product performance and functionality  knowledge and experience in the industry  product quality and reliability  customer service and support  and price 
verint believes that its success depends primarily on its ability to provide technologically advanced and cost effective solutions and to continue to provide its customers with prompt and responsive customer support 
competitors that manufacture other security related systems or other recording systems may derive a competitive advantage in selling to customers that are purchasing or have previously purchased other compatible equipment from such manufacturers 
further  verint expects that competition will increase as other established and emerging companies enter its markets and as new products  services and technologies are introduced 
competitors of ulticom primarily are internal development organizations within equipment manufactures and application developers who seek  in a build versus buy decision  to develop substitutes for its products 
ulticom also competes with a number of companies ranging from ss software solution providers  such as hughes software systems and ss networks  to vendors of communication and network infrastructure equipment  such as continuous computing corporation and hewlett packard company

many of the company s present and potential competitors are considerably larger than the company  are more established  have a larger installed base of customers and have greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources 
manufacturing and sources of supplies the company s manufacturing operations consist primarily of final assembly and testing  involving the application of extensive testing and quality control procedures to materials  components  subassemblies and systems 
the company primarily uses third parties to perform modules and subsystem assembly  component testing and sheet metal fabrication 
although the company generally uses standard parts and components in its products  certain components and subassemblies are presently available only from a limited number of sources 
to date  the company has been able to obtain adequate supplies of all components and subassemblies in a timely manner from existing sources or  when necessary  from alternative sources or redesign the system to incorporate new modules  when applicable 
however  the inability to obtain sufficient quantities of components or to locate alternative sources of supply if and as required in the future  would adversely affect the company s operations 
the company maintains organization wide quality assurance procedures  coordinating the quality control activities of the company s research and development  manufacturing and service departments 
capital market activities the company seeks to identify and implement suitable investments  and engages in portfolio investment and capital market activities  including venture capital investments directly and indirectly through private equity funds

the company has significantly reduced its new venture capital investments in recent periods 
operations in israel a substantial portion of the company s research and development  manufacturing and other operations are located in israel and  accordingly  may be affected by economic  political and military conditions in that country 
since the establishment of the state of israel in  a number of armed conflicts have taken place between israel and its arab neighbors  and the continued state of hostility  varying in degree and intensity  has led to security and economic problems for israel 
since october  there has been a significant increase in violence  primarily in the west bank and gaza strip  and israel has experienced terrorist incidents within its borders 
during this period  peace negotiations between israel and representatives of the palestinian authority have been sporadic and currently are suspended 
the company could be materially adversely affected by hostilities involving israel  the interruption or curtailment of trade between israel and its trading partners  or a significant downturn in the economic or financial condition of israel 
in addition  the sale of products manufactured in israel may be materially adversely affected in certain countries by restrictive laws  policies or practices directed toward israel or companies having operations in israel 
the continuation or exacerbation of violence in israel or the outbreak of violent conflicts involving israel may impede the company s ability to sell its products or otherwise adversely affect the company 
in addition  many of the company s israeli employees are required to perform annual compulsory military reserve duty in israel  and are subject to being called to active duty at any time under emergency circumstances 
the absence of these employees may have an adverse effect upon the company s operations 
israel is a member of the united nations  the international monetary fund  the international bank for reconstruction and development  and the international finance corporation  and is a signatory to the general agreement on tariffs and trade  which provides for reciprocal lowering of trade barriers among its members 
in addition  israel has been granted preferences under the generalized system of preferences from the united states  australia  canada  and japan 
these preferences allow israel to export the products covered by such programs either duty free or at reduced tariffs 
israel has entered into free trade agreements with its major trading partners 
israel and the european union are parties to a free trade agreement pursuant to which  subject to rules of origin  israel s industrial exports to the european union are exempt from customs duties and other non tariff barriers and import restrictions 
israel also has an agreement with the united states that established a free trade area eliminating all tariff and certain non tariff barriers on most trade between the two countries 
israel has also entered into an agreement with the european free trade association efta  which currently includes iceland  liechtenstein  norway and switzerland  that established a free trade zone between israel and efta nations exempting manufactured goods and some agricultural goods and processed foods from customs duties  while reducing duties on other goods 
israel also has free trade agreements with a number of other countries  such as canada  mexico and various european countries 
the end of the cold war has also enabled israel to establish commercial and trade relations with a number of nations  including russia and certain countries from the former soviet union  china  india and the nations of eastern europe  with whom israel had not previously had such relations 
the company s business is dependent to some extent on trading relationships between israel and other countries 
certain of the company s products incorporate components imported into israel from the united states and other countries and most of the company s products are sold outside of israel 
accordingly  the company s operations would be adversely affected if trade between israel and its current trading partners were interrupted or curtailed 
the sale of products manufactured in israel has been adversely affected in certain markets by restrictive laws  policies or practices directed toward israel or companies having operations in israel 
the continuation or exacerbation of conflicts involving israel and other nations may impede the company s ability to sell its products in certain markets 
the company benefits from various policies of the government of israel  including reduced taxation and special subsidy programs  designed to stimulate economic activity  particularly the high technology exporting industry  in that country 
as a condition of its receipt of funds for various research and development projects conducted under programs sponsored by the government of israel  the company has agreed that products resulting from these projects may not be manufactured  nor may the technology developed in the projects be transferred  outside of israel without government consent 
the results of operations of the company have been favorably affected by participation in israeli government programs related to research and development  as well as utilization of certain tax incentives and other incentives available under applicable israeli laws and regulations  some of which have been reduced  discontinued or otherwise modified in recent years 
in addition  the company s ability to obtain benefits under various discretionary funding programs has declined and may continue to decline 
the results of operations of the company could be adversely affected if these programs were further reduced or eliminated and not replaced with equivalent programs or if its ability to participate in these programs were to be reduced significantly 
employees at january   the company employed approximately  individuals  of whom approximately are scientists  engineers and technicians engaged in research and development  marketing  support and operations activities

the ability of the company s israeli subsidiaries to pay dividends is governed by israeli law  which provides that cash dividends may be paid by an israeli corporation only out of retained earnings as determined for statutory purposes in israeli currency 
in the event of a devaluation of the israeli currency against the dollar  the amount in dollars available for payment of cash dividends out of prior years earnings will decrease accordingly 
cash dividends paid by an israeli corporation to united states resident corporate parents are subject to the convention for the avoidance of double taxation between israel and the united states 
under the terms of the convention  such dividends are subject to taxation by both israel and the united states and  in the case of israel  such dividends out of income derived in respect of a period for which an israeli company is entitled to the reduced tax rate applicable to an approved enterprise are generally subject to withholding of israeli income tax at source at a rate of 
the israeli company is also subject to additional israeli taxes in respect of such dividends  generally equal to the tax benefits previously granted in respect of the underlying income by virtue of the approved enterprise status 
the company s liquidity and capital resources have not been  and are not anticipated to be  materially affected by restrictions pertaining to the ability of its foreign subsidiaries to pay dividends or by withholding taxes associated with any such dividend payments 
the company regularly examines opportunities for strategic acquisitions of other companies or lines of business and anticipates that it may from time to time issue additional debt and or equity securities either as direct consideration for such acquisitions or to raise additional funds to be used in whole or in part in payment for acquired securities or assets 
the issuance of such securities could be expected to have a dilutive impact on the company s shareholders  and there can be no assurance as to whether or when any acquired business would contribute positive operating results commensurate with the associated investment 
the company believes that its existing working capital  together with funds generated from operations  will be sufficient to provide for its planned operations for the foreseeable future  on both a consolidated and individual business segment basis 
certain trends and uncertainties the company derives the majority of its revenue from the telecommunications industry  which is experiencing a challenging capital spending environment 
while there is some evidence that the capital spending environment has improved  the spending by the company s customers remains uncertain 
the company s operating results and financial condition have been adversely affected by declines in technology purchases and capital expenditures by telecommunications service providers tsp  and the company s operating results and financial condition will be adversely affected in the event deterioration in capital expenditures by tsps resumes 
for these reasons and the risk factors outlined below  it has been and continues to be very difficult for the company to accurately forecast future revenues and operating results 
the company s business is particularly dependent on the strength of the telecommunications industry 
the telecommunications industry  including the company  have been negatively affected by  among other factors  the high costs and large debt positions incurred by some tsps to expand capacity and enable the provision of future services and the corresponding risks associated with the development  marketing and adoption of these services as discussed below  including the cost of acquisitions of licenses to provide broadband services and reductions in tsps actual and projected revenues and deterioration in their actual and projected operating results 
accordingly  tsps  including the company s customers  have significantly reduced their actual and planned expenditures to expand or replace equipment and delayed and reduced the deployment of services 
a number of tsps  including certain customers of the company  also have indicated the existence of conditions of excess capacity in certain markets 
in addition  certain tsps have delayed the planned introduction of new services  such as broadband mobile telephone services  that would be supported by certain of the company s products 
certain of the company s customers also have implemented changes in procurement practices and procedures  including limitations on purchases in anticipation of estimated future capacity requirements  and in the management and use of their networks  that have reduced the company s sales  which also has made it very difficult for the company to project future sales 
the continuation and or exacerbation of these negative trends will have an adverse effect on the company s future results 
in addition to loss of revenue  weakness in the telecommunications industry has affected and will continue to affect the company s business by increasing the risks of credit or business failures of suppliers  customers or distributors  by customer requirements for vendor financing and longer payment terms  by delays and defaults in customer or distributor payments  and by price reductions instituted by competitors to retain or acquire market share 
the company s current plan of operations is predicated in part on a recovery in capital expenditures by its customers 
in the absence of such improvement  the company would experience deterioration in its operating results  and may determine to modify its plan for future operations accordingly  which may include  among other things  additional reductions in its workforce 
the company intends to continue to make significant investments in its business  and to examine opportunities for growth through acquisitions and strategic investments 
these activities may involve significant expenditures and obligations that cannot readily be curtailed or reduced if anticipated demand for the associated products does not materialize or is delayed 
the impact of these decisions on future financial results cannot be predicted with assurance  and the company s commitment to growth may increase its vulnerability to downturns in its markets  technology changes and shifts in competitive conditions 
the company also may not be able to identify future suitable merger or acquisition candidates  and even if the company does identify suitable candidates  it may not be able to make these transactions on commercially acceptable terms  or at all 
if the company does make acquisitions  it may not be able to successfully incorporate the personnel  operations and customers of these companies into the company s business 
in addition  the company may fail to achieve the anticipated synergies from the combined businesses  including marketing  product integration  distribution  product development and other synergies 
the integration process may further strain the company s existing financial and managerial controls and reporting systems and procedures 
this may result in the diversion of management and financial resources from the company s core business objectives 
in addition  an acquisition or merger may require the company to utilize cash reserves  incur debt or issue equity securities  which may result in a dilution of existing stockholders  and the company may be negatively impacted by the assumption of liabilities of the merged or acquired company 
due to rapidly changing market conditions  the company may find the value of its acquired technologies and related intangible assets  such as goodwill as recorded in the company s financial statements  to be impaired  resulting in charges to operations 
the company may also fail to retain the acquired or merged companies key employees and customers 
in may  the company issued  aggregate principal amount of zero yield puttable securities zyps 
the zyps are convertible into shares of the company s common stock at a conversion price of per share  which would result in the issuance of an aggregate of approximately million shares  subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events 
the ability of the holders to convert the zyps into common stock is subject to certain conditions including  among others  the closing price of the common stock exceeding of the conversion price over certain periods and other specified events 
the zyps mature on may  the company has the right to redeem the zyps for cash at any time on or after may   at their principal amount 
the holders have a series of put options  pursuant to which they may require the company to repurchase all or a portion of the zyps on each of may of   and and upon the occurrence of certain events 
the zyps holders may require the company to repurchase the zyps at par in the event that the common stock ceases to be publicly traded and  in certain instances  upon a change in control of the company 
the company may not have enough cash or have the ability to access enough cash to pay the zyps 
if the threshold for conversion of the zyps is achieved it will result in dilution of the company s earnings per share 
if the zyps are converted into the company s shares it will result in a dilution of existing stockholders 
the company has made  and in the future  may continue to make strategic investments in other companies 
these investments have been made in  and future investments will likely be made in  immature businesses with unproven track records and technologies 
such investments have a high degree of risk  with the possibility that the company may lose the total amount of its investments 
the company may not be able to identify suitable investment candidates  and  even if it does  the company may not be able to make those investments on acceptable terms  or at all 
in addition  even if the company makes investments  it may not gain strategic benefits from those investments 
the company s products involve sophisticated hardware and software technology that performs critical functions to highly demanding standards 
there can be no assurance that the company s current or future products will not develop operational problems  which could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company offers complex products that may contain undetected defects or errors  particularly when first introduced or as new versions are released 
the company may not discover such defects or errors until after a product has been released and used by the customer 
significant costs may be incurred to correct undetected defects or errors in the company s products and these defects or errors could result in future lost sales 
in addition  defects or errors in the company s products may result in product liability claims  which could cause adverse publicity and impair their market acceptance 
the telecommunications industry is subject to rapid technological change 
the introduction of new technologies in the telecommunications market  including the delay in the adoption of such new technologies  and new alternatives for the delivery of services are having  and can be expected to continue to have  a profound effect on competitive conditions in the market and the success of market participants  including the company 
in addition  some of the company s products  such as call answering  have experienced declines in usage resulting from  among other factors  the introduction of new technologies and the adoption and increased use of existing technologies  which may include enhanced areas of coverage for mobile telephones and caller id type services 
the company s continued success will depend on its ability to correctly anticipate technological trends in its industries  to react quickly and effectively to such trends and to enhance its existing products and to introduce new products on a timely and cost effective basis 
as a result  the life cycle of the company s products is difficult to estimate 
the company s new product offerings may not enter the market in a timely manner for their acceptance 
new product offerings may not properly integrate into existing platforms  and the failure of these offerings to be accepted by the market could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  and financial condition 
the company s sales and operating results may be adversely affected in the event customers delay purchases of existing products as they await the company s new product offerings 
changing industry and market conditions may dictate strategic decisions to restructure some business units and discontinue others 
discontinuing a business unit or product line may result in the company recording accrued liabilities for special charges  such as costs associated with a reduction in workforce 
these strategic decisions could result in changes to determinations regarding a product s useful life and the recoverability of the carrying basis of certain assets 
the company has made and continues to make significant investments in the areas of sales and marketing  and research and development 
the company s research and development activities  which may be delayed and behind schedule  include ongoing significant investment in the development of additional features and functionality for its existing and new product offerings 
the success of these initiatives will be dependent upon  among other things  the emergence of a market for these types of products and their acceptance by existing and new customers 
the company s business may be adversely affected by its failure to correctly anticipate the emergence of a market demand for certain products or services  and changes in the evolution of market opportunities 
if a sufficient market does not emerge for new or enhanced product offerings developed by the company  if the company is late in introducing new product offerings  or if the company is not successful in marketing such products  the company s continued growth could be adversely affected and its investment in those products may be lost 
the company relies on a limited number of suppliers and manufacturers for specific components and may not be able to find alternate manufacturers that meet its requirements and existing or alternative sources may not be available on favorable terms and conditions 
thus  if there is a shortage of supply for these components  the company may experience an interruption in its product supply 
in addition  loss of third party software licensing could materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the telecommunications industry continues to undergo significant change as a result of deregulation and privatization worldwide  reducing restrictions on competition in the industry 
unforeseen changes in the regulatory environment also may have an impact on the company s revenues and or costs in any given part of the world 
the worldwide ess system industry is already highly competitive and the company expects competition to intensify 
the company believes that existing competitors will continue to present substantial competition  and that other companies  many with considerably greater financial  marketing and sales resources than the company  may enter the ess system markets 
moreover  as the company enters into new markets as a result of its own research and development efforts or acquisitions  it is likely to encounter new competitors 
the market for the company s security and business intelligence products in the past has been affected by weakness in general economic conditions  delays or reductions in customers information technology spending and uncertainties relating to government expenditure programs 
the company s business generated from government contracts may be adversely affected if i the company s reputation or relationship with government agencies is impaired  ii the company is suspended or otherwise prohibited from contracting with a domestic or foreign government or any significant law enforcement agency  iii levels of government expenditures and authorizations for law enforcement and security related programs decrease  remain constant or shift to programs in areas where the company does not provide products and services  iv the company is prevented from entering into new government contracts or extending existing government contracts based on violations or suspected violations of laws or regulations  including those related to procurement  v the company is not granted security clearances required to sell products to domestic or foreign governments or such security clearances are revoked  or vi there is a change in government procurement procedures 
competitive conditions in this sector also have been affected by the increasing use by certain potential customers of their own internal development resources rather than outside vendors to provide certain technical solutions 
in addition  a number of established government contractors  particularly developers and integrators of technology products  have taken steps to redirect their marketing strategies and product plans in reaction to cut backs in their traditional areas of focus  resulting in an increase in the number of competitors and the range of products offered in response to particular requests for proposals 
a subsidiary of the company  verint technology inc verint technology  which sells and supports its communications interception solutions to various us government agencies  is required by the national industrial security program to maintain facility security clearances and to be insulated from foreign ownership  control or influence 
the company  verint  verint technology and the department of defense entered into a proxy agreement  under which verint  among other requirements  appointed three us citizens holding the requisite security clearances to exercise all prerogatives of ownership of verint technology including  without limitation  oversight of verint technology s security arrangements as holders of proxies to vote verint technology stock 
the proxy agreement may be terminated and verint technology s facility security clearances may be revoked in the event of a breach of the proxy agreement  or if it is determined by the department of defense that termination is in the national interest 
if verint technology s facility security clearance is revoked  sales to us government agencies will be adversely affected and may adversely affect sales to other international government agencies 
in addition  concerns about the security of verint  its personnel or its products may have a material adverse affect on verint s business  financial condition and results of operations  including a negative impact on sales to us and international government agencies 
the company has historically derived a significant portion of its sales and operating profit from contracts for large system installations with major customers 
the company continues to emphasize large capacity systems in its product development and marketing strategies 
contracts for large installations typically involve a lengthy and complex bidding and selection process  and the ability of the company to obtain particular contracts is inherently difficult to predict 
the timing and scope of these opportunities and the pricing and margins associated with any eventual contract award are difficult to forecast  and may vary substantially from transaction to transaction 
the company s future operating results may accordingly exhibit a higher degree of volatility than the operating results of other companies in its industries that have adopted different strategies  and also may be more volatile than the company has experienced in prior periods 
the degree of dependence by the company on large system orders  and the investment required to enable the company to perform such orders  without assurance of continuing order flow from the same customers and predictability of gross margins on any future orders  increase the risk associated with its business 
because a significant proportion of the company s sales of these large system installations occur in the late stages of a quarter  a delay  cancellation or other factor resulting in the postponement or cancellation of such sales may cause the company to miss its financial projections  which may not be discernible until the end of a financial reporting period 
the company s gross margins also may be adversely affected by increases in material or labor costs  obsolescence charges  price competition and changes in channels of distribution or in the mix of products sold 
during the period between the evaluation and purchase of a system  customers may defer or scale down proposed orders of the company s products for  among other reasons i changes in budgets and purchasing priorities  ii reduced need to upgrade existing systems  iii deferrals in anticipation of enhancements or new products  iv introduction of products by the company s competitors  and v lower prices offered by the company s competitors 
geopolitical  economic and military conditions could directly affect the company s operations 
the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars curtailed travel to and from certain countries primarily in the asia pacific region 
restrictions on travel to and from these and other regions on account of additional incidents of sars could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  and financial condition 
the continued threat of terrorism and heightened security and military action in response to this threat  or any future acts of terrorism  may cause disruptions to the company s business 
to the extent that such disruptions result in delays or cancellations of customer orders  or the manufacture or shipment of the company s products  the company s business  operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
more recently  the us military involvement in overseas operations including  for example  the war with iraq  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  and financial condition 
since the establishment of the state of israel in  a number of armed conflicts have taken place between israel and its arab neighbors  and the continued state of hostility  varying in degree and intensity  has led to security and economic problems for israel 
since october  there has been a significant increase in violence  primarily in the west bank and gaza strip  and more recently israel has experienced terrorist incidents within its borders 
during this period  peace negotiations between israel and representatives of the palestinian authority have been sporadic and currently are suspended 
the company could be materially adversely affected by hostilities involving israel  the interruption or curtailment of trade between israel and its trading partners  or a significant downturn in the economic or financial condition of israel 
in addition  the sale of products manufactured in israel may be materially adversely affected in certain countries by restrictive laws  policies or practices directed toward israel or companies having operations in israel 
the continuation or exacerbation of violence in israel or the outbreak of violent conflicts involving israel may impede the company s ability to sell its products or otherwise adversely affect the company 
in addition  many of the company s israeli employees in israel are required to perform annual compulsory military service in israel and are subject to being called to active duty at any time under emergency circumstances 
the absence of these employees may have an adverse effect upon the company s operations 
the company s costs of operations have at times been affected by changes in the cost of its operations in israel  resulting from changes in the value of the israeli shekel relative to the united states dollar  which for certain periods had a negative impact  and from difficulties in attracting and retaining qualified scientific  engineering and technical personnel in israel  where the availability of such personnel has at times been severely limited 
changes in these cost factors have from time to time been significant and difficult to predict  and could in the future have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
the company s historical operating results reflect substantial benefits received from programs sponsored by the israeli government for the support of research and development  as well as tax moratoriums and favorable tax rates associated with investments in approved projects approved enterprises in israel 
some of these programs and tax benefits have ceased and others may not be continued in the future and the availability of such benefits to the company may be affected by a number of factors  including budgetary constraints resulting from adverse economic conditions  government policies and the company s ability to satisfy eligibility criteria 
the israeli government has reduced the benefits available under some of these programs in recent years  and israeli government authorities have indicated that the government may further reduce or eliminate some of these benefits in the future 
the company has regularly participated in a conditional grant program administered by the office of the chief scientist of the ministry of industry and trade of the state of israel ocs under which it has received significant benefits through reimbursement of up to of qualified research and development expenditures 
certain of the company s subsidiaries not including comverse currently pay royalties  of between and or under certain circumstances of associated product revenues including service and other related revenues to the government of israel for repayment of benefits received under this program 
such royalty payments are currently required to be made until the government has been reimbursed the amounts received by the company  which is linked to the us dollar  plus  for amounts received under projects approved by the ocs after january   interest on such amount at a rate equal to the month libor rate in effect on january of the year in which approval is obtained 
as of january   such subsidiaries of the company received approximately million in cumulative grants from the ocs and recorded approximately million in cumulative royalties to the ocs 
during the year ended january   comverse finalized an arrangement with the ocs whereby comverse agreed to pay a lump sum royalty amount for all past amounts received from the ocs 
in addition  comverse began to receive lower amounts from the ocs than it had historically received  but will not have to pay royalty amounts on such grants 
the amount of reimbursement received by the company under this program has been reduced significantly  and the company does not expect to receive significant reimbursement under this program in the future 
in addition  permission from the government of israel is required for the company to manufacture outside of israel products resulting from research and development activities funded under these programs  or to transfer outside of israel related technology rights 
in order to obtain such permission  the company may be required to increase the royalties to the applicable funding agencies and or repay certain amounts received as reimbursement of research and development costs 
the continued reduction in the benefits received by the company under the program  or the termination of its eligibility to receive these benefits at all in the future  could adversely affect the company s operating results 
the company s overall effective tax rate benefits from the tax moratorium provided by the government of israel for approved enterprises undertaken in that country 
the company s effective tax rate may increase in the future due to  among other factors  the increased proportion of its taxable income associated with activities in higher tax jurisdictions  and by the relative ages of the company s eligible investments in israel 
the tax moratorium on income from the company s approved enterprise investments made prior to is four years  whereas subsequent approved enterprise projects are eligible for a moratorium of only two years 
reduced tax rates apply in each case for certain periods thereafter 
to be eligible for these tax benefits  the company must continue to meet conditions  including making specified investments in fixed assets and financing a percentage of investments with share capital 
if the company fails to meet such conditions in the future  the tax benefits would be canceled and the company could be required to refund the tax benefits already received 
israeli authorities have indicated that additional limitations on the tax benefits associated with approved enterprise projects may be imposed for certain categories of taxpayers  which would include the company 
if further changes in the law or government policies regarding those programs were to result in their termination or adverse modification  or if the company were to become unable to participate in  or take advantage of  those programs  the cost of the company s operations in israel would increase and there could be a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
the company s success is dependent on recruiting and retaining key management and highly skilled technical  managerial  sales  and marketing personnel 
the market for highly skilled personnel remains very competitive despite the current economic conditions 
the company s ability to attract and retain employees also may be affected by recent cost control actions  including reductions in the company s workforce and the associated reorganization of operations 
certain of the company s products are often used by customers to compile and analyze highly sensitive or confidential information and data 
the company may come into contact with such information or data when it performs support or maintenance functions for its customers 
while it has internal policies  procedures and training for employees in connection with performing these functions  even the perception that any of its employees has improperly handled sensitive or confidential information and data of a customer could harm its reputation and could inhibit market acceptance of its products 
the occurrence or perception of security breaches within the company could harm the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
while the company implements sophisticated security measures  third parties may attempt to breach the company s security through computer viruses  electronic break ins and other disruptions 
if successful  confidential information  including passwords  financial information  or other personal information may be improperly obtained and the company may be subject to lawsuits and other liability 
even if the company is not held liable  a security breach could harm the company s reputation  and even the perception of security risks  whether or not valid  could inhibit market acceptance of the company s products 
the company currently derives a significant portion of its total sales from customers outside of the united states 
international transactions involve particular risks  including political decisions affecting tariffs and trade conditions  rapid and unforeseen changes in economic conditions in individual countries  turbulence in foreign currency and credit markets  and increased costs resulting from lack of proximity to the customer 
the company is required to obtain export licenses and other authorizations from applicable governmental authorities for certain countries within which it conducts business 
the failure to receive any required license or authorization would hinder the company s ability to sell its products and could adversely affect the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  legal uncertainties regarding liability  compliance with local laws and regulations  labor laws  employee benefits  currency restrictions  difficulty in accounts receivable collection  longer collection periods and other requirements may have a negative impact on the company s operating results 
volatility in international currency exchange rates may have a significant impact on the company s operating results 
the company has  and anticipates that it will continue to receive  contracts denominated in foreign currencies  particularly the euro 
as a result of the unpredictable timing of purchase orders and payments under such contracts and other factors  it is often not practicable for the company to effectively hedge the risk of significant changes in currency rates during the contract period 
the company may experience risk associated with the failure to hedge the exchange rate risks associated with contracts denominated in foreign currencies and its operating results have been negatively impacted for certain periods and may continue to be affected to a material extent by the impact of currency fluctuations 
operating results may also be affected by the cost of such hedging activities that the company does undertake 
while the company generally requires employees  independent contractors and consultants to execute non competition and confidentiality agreements  the company s intellectual property or proprietary rights could be infringed or misappropriated  which could result in expensive and protracted litigation 
the company relies on a combination of patent  copyright  trade secret and trademark law to protect its technology 
despite the company s efforts to protect its intellectual property and proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use its products or technology 
effectively policing the unauthorized use of the company s products is time consuming and costly  and there can be no assurance that the steps taken by the company will prevent misappropriation of its technology  particularly in foreign countries where in many instances the local laws or legal systems do not offer the same level of protection as in the united states 
if others claim that the company s products infringe their intellectual property rights  the company may be forced to seek expensive licenses  reengineer its products  engage in expensive and time consuming litigation or stop marketing its products 
the company attempts to avoid infringing known proprietary rights of third parties in its product development efforts 
the company does not regularly conduct comprehensive patent searches to determine whether the technology used in its products infringes patents held by third parties  however 
there are many issued patents as well as patent applications in the fields in which the company is engaged 
because patent applications in the united states are not publicly disclosed until the patent is issued  applications may have been filed which relate to the company s software and products 
if the company were to discover that its products violated or potentially violated third party proprietary rights  it might not be able to obtain licenses to continue offering those products without substantial reengineering 
any reengineering effort may not be successful  nor can the company be certain that any licenses would be available on commercially reasonable terms 
substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in technology related industries  and the company expects that its products may be increasingly subject to third party infringement claims as the number of competitors in its industry segments grows and the functionality of software products in different industry segments overlaps 
in addition  the company has agreed to indemnify certain customers in certain situations should it be determined that its products infringe on the proprietary rights of third parties 
any third party infringement claims could be time consuming to defend  result in costly litigation  divert management s attention and resources  cause product and service delays or require the company to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
any royalty or licensing arrangements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to the company  if at all 
a successful claim of infringement against the company and its failure or inability to license the infringed or similar technology could have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company holds a large proportion of its net assets in cash equivalents and short term investments  including a variety of public and private debt and equity instruments  and has made significant venture capital investments  both directly and through private investment funds 
such investments subject the company to the risks inherent in the capital markets generally  and to the performance of other businesses over which it has no direct control 
given the relatively high proportion of the company s liquid assets relative to its overall size  the results of its operations are materially affected by the results of the company s capital management and investment activities and the risks associated with those activities 
declines in the public equity markets have caused  and may be expected to continue to cause  the company to experience realized and unrealized investment losses 
in addition  reduction in prevailing interest rates due to economic conditions or government policies has had and may continue to have an adverse impact on the company s results of operations 
the severe decline in the public trading prices of equity securities  particularly in the technology and telecommunications sectors  and corresponding decline in values of privately held companies and venture capital funds in which the company has invested  have  and may continue to have  an adverse impact on the company s financial results 
the company has in the past benefited from the long term rise in the public trading price of its shares in various ways  including its ability to use equity incentive arrangements as a means of attracting and retaining the highly qualified employees necessary for the growth of its business and its ability to raise capital on relatively attractive conditions 
the decline in the price of the company s shares  and the overall decline in equity prices generally  and in the shares of technology companies in particular  can be expected to make it more difficult for the company to significantly rely on equity incentive arrangements as a means to recruit and retain talented employees 
the company s operating results have fluctuated in the past and may do so in the future 
the trading price of the company s shares has been affected by the factors disclosed herein as well as prevailing economic and financial trends and conditions in the public securities markets 
share prices of companies in technology related industries  such as the company  tend to exhibit a high degree of volatility  which at times is unrelated to the operating performance of a company 
the announcement of financial results that fall short of the results anticipated by the public markets could have an immediate and significant negative effect on the trading price of the company s shares in any given period 
such shortfalls may result from events that are beyond the company s immediate control  can be unpredictable and  since a significant proportion of the company s sales during each fiscal quarter tend to occur in the latter stages of the quarter  may not be discernible until the end of a financial reporting period 
these factors may contribute to the volatility of the trading value of its shares regardless of the company s long term prospects 
the trading price of the company s shares may also be affected by developments  including reported financial results and fluctuations in trading prices of the shares of other publicly held companies in the telecommunications equipment industry in general  and the company s business segments in particular  which may not have any direct relationship with the company s business or prospects 
the company s board of directors ability to designate and issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to issue additional shares of common stock could adversely affect the voting power of the holders of common stock  and could have the effect of making it more difficult for a person to acquire  or could discourage a person from seeking to acquire  control of the company 
if this occurs  investors could lose the opportunity to receive a premium on the sale of their shares in a change of control transaction 
off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations as part of our ongoing business  we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities spes  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as of january   we were not involved in any unconsolidated spe transactions 
the company has obtained bank guaranties primarily for the performance of certain obligations under contracts with customers as well as for the guarantee of certain payment obligations 
these guaranties  which aggregated approximately million at january   are generally to be released by the company s performance of specified contract milestones  which are scheduled to be completed primarily during the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and may  from time to time  use foreign currency exchange contracts and other derivative instruments to reduce its exposure to the risk that the eventual net cash inflows and outflows resulting from the sale of its products in foreign currency  primarily the euro  will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates 
the objective of these contracts is to neutralize the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on the company s operating results 
these instruments are not designated as hedges and the change in fair value is included in income currently 
as of january   the company had approximately million of notional amount of foreign exchange forward contracts to sell euros with an original maturity of three months 
the fair value of these contracts as of january  of approximately million is included in interest and other income expense  net in the consolidated statements of operations

the ability of the holders to convert the zyps into common stock is subject to certain conditions including  among others  the closing price of the common stock exceeding of the conversion price over certain periods and other specified events 
the company has the right to redeem the zyps for cash at any time on or after may   at their principal amount 
the holders have a series of put options  pursuant to which they may require the company to repurchase all or a portion of the zyps on each of may of   and and upon the occurrence of certain events 
the zyps holders may require the company to repurchase the zyps at par in the event that the common stock ceases to be publicly traded and  in certain instances  upon a change in control of the company 
upon the occurrence of a change in control  instead of paying the repurchase price in cash  the company may  under certain circumstances  pay the repurchase price in common stock 
purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on the company and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty
