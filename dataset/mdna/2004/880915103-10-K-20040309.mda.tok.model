item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction we produce and market nitrogen products for agricultural and industrial markets with production facilities located in north america and the united kingdom 
nitrogen products are commodity chemicals that are sold at prices reflecting global supply and demand conditions 
the nitrogen products industry has cycles of oversupply  resulting in lower prices and idled capacity  followed by supply shortages  resulting in high selling prices and higher industry wide production rates 
in order to be viable in this industry  a producer must be among the low cost suppliers in the markets it serves and have a financial position that can sustain it during periods of oversupply 
in recent periods  high nitrogen margins in led to capacity expansion projects globally that resulted in capacity increases that were  in the short term  substantially greater than demand growth  causing oversupply conditions that reduced nitrogen prices 
since  that new global capacity has been partially offset by demand growth as well as permanent plant closings in the us and europe but  nonetheless  the industry generally has remained in an oversupply situation 
natural gas is the most significant raw material in the production of nitrogen products 
north american natural gas costs have increased substantially since since we compete with nitrogen products imported from regions with lower natural gas costs  we and other north american producers have not been able to increase selling prices to levels necessary to cover the natural gas cost increases 
this resulted in curtailments of north american nitrogen production by terra and other producers 
these curtailments contributed to reductions in global nitrogen product supplies 
our united kingdom operations benefited from the reduction in global supplies and also realized higher selling prices  but incurred natural gas costs lower than those in north america 
imports  most of which are produced at facilities with access to fixed price natural gas supplies  account for a significant portion of us nitrogen product supply 
imported products natural gas costs have been and could continue to be substantially lower than the delivered cost of natural gas to our facilities 
off shore producers are most competitive in regions close to the point of entry for imports  including the gulf coast and east coast of north america 
our sales volumes depend primarily on our plants operating rates 
we may purchase product from other manufacturers or importers for resale  but gross margins on those volumes are rarely significant 
profitability and cash flows from our nitrogen products business are affected by our ability to manage our costs and expenses other than natural gas  most of which do not materially change for different levels of production or sales 
other factors affecting our nitrogen products results include the level of planted acres  transportation costs  weather conditions particularly during the planting season  grain prices and other variables described in items and business and properties of this report 
we also produce methanol in the us like nitrogen products  methanol is a commodity chemical manufactured from natural gas 
consequently  natural gas costs and the supply demand balance for methanol significantly affect methanol earnings and cash flows 
a significant portion of us methanol demand is met by imports from regions with natural gas costs lower than those available to us producers 
industry analysts have identified approximately million metric tonnes of new methanol capacity of current global demand that should start up from through in regions with low 
table of contents natural gas costs 
us methanol demand has declined over the past year and is expected to continue to decline due to reduced us consumption of mtbe  a gasoline oxygenate and octane enhancer that uses methanol as a feedstock 
in december  we entered into contracts with the methanex corporation methanex assigning it our sales contracts and providing it exclusive rights to all methanol production at the beaumont facility for five years as more fully described in items and business and properties of this report 
overview of consolidated results terra reported net losses of million in  million in and million in with a loss per share of  and  respectively 
revenues from continuing operations totaled  million in   million in and  million in our net loss included a million charge for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting for goodwill per share and a million loss from discontinued operations per share 
at the beginning of  we implemented statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and determined that million of assets classified as excess of cost over net assets of acquired businesses suffered impairment and had no value 
the loss from discontinued operations was for a million increase to reserves for discontinued operations  net of a million income tax benefit 
approximately million of the charge was attributable to discontinued coal operations in response to higher than expected retiree health care costs and increased payments to union funds for which the company is contingently liable under the coal industry retiree health benefit act of the remaining million was provided to cover a jury award of million to an individual employed by terra s distribution business that was sold in and to provide reserves against notes receivable and other assets associated with previously discontinued operations 
the net loss from continuing operations was million in  million in and million in during  we recorded a million net charge for the impairment of our blytheville facility representing a million impairment charge to operating income less million allocated to minority interest and million of income tax benefit 
the net loss was reduced by approximately million of income tax benefits for a reduced assessment by a foreign taxing authority and reversals of tax reserves that had been provided in prior years 
the net loss from continuing operations included million of goodwill amortization that did not recur in subsequent years because of an accounting change and million net of million in related income tax benefits of product recall costs 
other fluctuations to our net loss from continuing operations for through are primarily related to changes in the selling prices of nitrogen products and methanol and changes in the cost of natural gas  our primary raw material 
factors that affect operating results factors that may affect our operating results include the relative balance of supply and demand for nitrogen fertilizers  industrial nitrogen and methanol  the availability and cost of natural gas  the number of planted acres which is affected by both worldwide demand and government policies  the types of crops planted  the effect of general weather patterns on the timing and duration of field work for crop planting and harvesting  the effect of environmental legislation on supply and demand for our products  the availability of financing sources to fund seasonal working capital needs  and the potential for interruption to operations due to accidents or natural disasters 

table of contents the principal raw material used to produce nitrogen products and methanol is natural gas 
natural gas costs in accounted for about of total costs and expenses for our north american nitrogen products business  of total costs and expenses for our uk nitrogen products business and of total costs and expenses for our methanol business 
a significant increase in the price of natural gas that is not hedged or recovered through an increase in the price of our nitrogen and methanol products would have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results 
during parts of and  price spikes in north american natural gas markets prompted industry wide curtailments of nitrogen production 
we produced only and of our total nitrogen capacity in and  respectively  because of plant shutdowns and production curtailments related to high natural gas costs and to balance inventory levels with demand 
during  we produced only of our methanol capacity for similar reasons 
a portion of global nitrogen products and methanol production is at facilities with access to fixed price natural gas supplies that have been  and could continue to be  substantially lower priced than our natural gas 
we enter into forward pricing contracts for some of our natural gas requirements  so long as such arrangements would not result in costs greater than expected for selling prices for our finished products 
our current natural gas forward pricing policy is to fix or cap the price of between and of our natural gas requirements for a rolling month period and up to of our natural gas requirements for the subsequent month period through supply contracts  financial derivatives and other instruments 
we notify the board of directors when we deviate from the policy 
december  forward positions covered of our expected natural gas requirements and none beyond 
the global supply and demand balance for ammonia and other nitrogen based products influences prices for terra s nitrogen products 
long term demand is affected by population growth and rising living standards that determine food consumption 
short term demand is affected by world economic conditions  international trade decisions and grain prices 
for example  demand was reduced  in part  due to relatively high nitrogen prices and low grain prices 
supply is affected by increasing worldwide capacity and the availability of nitrogen product exports from major producing regions such as the former soviet union  the middle east and south america 
methanol is used as a raw material in the production of formaldehyde  methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe  acetic acid and numerous other chemical derivatives 
the price of methanol is influenced by the supply and demand for each of these products 
environmental initiatives to ban or reduce the use of mtbe as a fuel additive  such as those currently underway in the united states  will significantly affect demand for methanol 
weather can have a significant effect on demand for our nitrogen products 
weather conditions that delay or intermittently disrupt field work during the planting and growing seasons may cause agricultural customers to use forms of nitrogen fertilizer that are more or less favorable to our sales 
weather conditions following harvest may delay or eliminate opportunities to apply fertilizer in the fall 
weather can also have an adverse effect on crop yields  which lowers the income of growers and could impair their ability to pay for crop inputs purchased from our dealer customers 

table of contents our nitrogen business segment is seasonal  with more nitrogen products consumed during the second quarter in conjunction with spring planting activity than in any other quarter 
due to the seasonality of the business and the relatively brief periods during which customers consume nitrogen products  our customers and we generally build inventories during the second half of the year in order to ensure product availability during the peak sales season 
for our current level of sales  we require lines of credit to fund inventory increases and to support customer credit terms 
we believe that our credit facilities are adequate for expected production levels in our manufacturing operations may be subject to significant interruption if one or more of our facilities were to experience a major accident or were damaged by severe weather or other natural disaster 
we currently maintain insurance  including business interruption insurance  which we believe is sufficient to allow us to withstand major damage to any of our facilities 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america for reporting purposes 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amount of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that reflect significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
our critical accounting policies are described below 
impairment of long lived assets we will record impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicated that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of these items 
our cash flow estimates are based on historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and operating conditions 
the net carrying value of assets not recoverable is reduced to fair value 
our estimates of fair value represent our best estimate based on industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions 
estimates of future cash flows are subject to significant uncertainties and assumptions 
accordingly  actual results could vary significantly from such estimates 
during  events occurred that necessitated an evaluation of recoverability of assets at our blytheville and beaumont facilities 
on june   we suspended production at our blytheville facility due to expectations that the facility would not cover its cash costs because of continuing high natural gas costs and the seasonal decline in nitrogen fertilizer demand and prices 
in response to this action and as required by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we commenced a review to determine if the blytheville facility s carrying value was impaired 
this review led us to conclude that future market conditions may not justify the ongoing investment in maintenance and replacement capital necessary to extend operations for the remainder of the facility s useful life 
accordingly a million charge was recorded during the second quarter as an impairment of 
table of contents long lived assets 
while the plant s value is permanently impaired  we resumed production in october in response to higher urea selling prices and improved seasonal demand 
we anticipate to million of spending will be required when the facility is permanently idled 
at december   the beaumont facility had a carrying value  net of million of deferred revenues  of about million 
we estimated the remaining useful life of this facility at years assuming normal investment in maintenance and replacement capital throughout this period 
our estimated cash flows over this period  based on our best estimate of future market and operating conditions at december   exceeded the carrying value of these assets and consequently  no impairment charge was recorded for the beaumont facility 
these cash flow estimates are subject to significant uncertainties and assumptions 
consequently  actual results for the beaumont facility could vary substantially from such estimates 
pension assets and liabilities pension assets and liabilities are affected by the estimated market value of plan assets  estimates of the expected return on plan assets and discount rates 
actual changes in the fair market value of plan assets and differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets will affect the amount of pension expense ultimately recognized 
our pension liabilities were million at december   which was million higher than pension plan assets 
the december  liability was computed based on an average discount rate  which was based on yields for high quality corporate bonds with a maturity approximating the duration of our pension liability 
declines in comparable bond yields would increase our pension liability 
our net pension liability  after deduction of plan assets  could increase or decrease depending on the extent to which returns on pension plan assets are lower or higher than the discount rate 
post retirement benefits post retirement benefits are determined on an actuarial basis and are affected by assumptions including the discount rate and expected trends in health care costs 
changes in the discount rate and differences between actual and expected health care costs will affect the recorded amount of post retirement benefits expense ultimately recognized 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when title to finished product passes to the customer 
revenue is recognized as the net amount to be received after deducting estimated amounts for discounts and trade allowances 
revenue includes amounts paid by customers for shipping and handling 
deferred income taxes deferred income tax assets and liabilities reflect a differences between financial statement carrying amounts and corresponding tax bases and b temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
deferred tax assets also include the expected benefits of carrying forward our net operating losses 
we regularly review deferred tax assets for recoverability and reduce them if we can not sufficiently determine that they will be realized 
we base this determination on projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 

table of contents at december   deferred tax assets representing future benefits for our us net operating loss carryforwards totaled million 
we have not generated us taxable income since and  in consideration of the substantial increases to north american natural gas costs since  we do not have a basis to conclude that future taxable earnings are likely to be available to utilize benefits associated with loss carryforwards 
accordingly  at december  for us operations  we have reduced our deferred tax assets to equal net deferred tax liabilities 
further  we do not expect to recognize additional us tax benefits for future losses until we realize taxable income or generate additional deferred tax liabilities for temporary differences 
if there is a material change in the effective tax rates or time period when temporary difference become taxable or deductible  we may have to additionally reduce all or a significant portion of our deferred tax assets 
inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost and estimated net realizable value 
the average cost of inventories is determined by using the first in  first out method 
the nitrogen and methanol industries are characterized by rapid change in both demand and pricing 
rapid declines in demand could result in temporary or permanent curtailment of production  while rapid declines in price could result in a lower cost or market adjustment 
derivative and financial instruments terra accounts for derivatives in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
requires the recognition of derivatives in the balance sheet and the measurement of these instruments at fair value 
changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded in earnings unless the normal purchase or sale exception applies or hedge accounting is elected 
terra enters into derivative instruments including future contracts  swap agreements  and purchased options to cap or fix prices for a portion of natural gas production requirements 
terra has designated  documented and assessed accounting hedge relationships  which mostly resulted in cash flow hedges that require the recording of the derivative assets or liabilities at their fair value on the balance sheet with an offset in other comprehensive income 
amounts are removed from other comprehensive income as the underlying transactions occur and realized gains or losses are recorded 

table of contents results of continuing operations compared with consolidated results we reported a loss from continuing operations of million on revenues of  million compared with a loss from continued operations of million on revenues of  million in basic and diluted loss per share from continuing operations for was compared with for the net loss included a million net charge for the impairment of our blytheville facility representing a million impairment charge to operating income less million allocated to minority interest and million of income tax benefit 
the net loss was reduced by approximately million of income tax benefits for a reduced assessment by a foreign taxing authority and reversals of tax reserves that had been provided in prior years 
we classify our operations into two business segments nitrogen products and methanol 
the nitrogen products segment represents the sale of nitrogen products including that produced at our ammonia manufacturing and upgrading facilities 
the methanol segment represents wholesale sales of methanol including that produced at our two methanol manufacturing facilities

sales prices were higher as the result of lower fertilizer supplies caused by increased demand and industry wide production curtailments 
sales volumes in were lower than the previous year due to our own production curtailments including a decision to suspend production during the third quarter at the blytheville facility because of high natural gas costs and the seasonal decline in nitrogen fertilizer demand and prices 
higher selling prices contributed million to results and were only partially offset by higher natural gas costs

table of contents income taxes income tax benefits were recorded at an effective rate of for compared with for the increase in the benefit rate reflects the absence of non deductible goodwill amortization in and foreign income tax adjustments during liquidity and capital resources our primary uses of funds are to fund our working capital requirements  make payments on our debt and other obligations and make plant turnarounds and capital expenditures 
the principle sources of funds will be cash flow from operations and borrowings under available bank facilities 
during  cash and short term investments increased million 
net cash provided by operating activities was million  which was more than cash used for investing activities  primarily capital expenditures and plant turnaround costs  of million 
an additional million was used in financing activities  primarily for fees in connection with the refinancing of long term debt obligations 
net cash provided by operating activities was million  composed of million of cash provided from operating activities  million of deferred revenue received for the methanol distribution agreement with methanex  less million used by higher working capital needs 
working capital needs primarily consisted of increases to accounts receivable for higher selling prices than the fourth quarter and reductions to trade accounts payable as the result of lower credit availability from natural gas suppliers 
we had million in customer prepayments at december  that we anticipate will be satisfied during our first and second quarters 
during and  we funded plant and equipment purchases of million and million  respectively  primarily for replacement or stay in business capital needs 
we expect plant and equipment purchases to be less than million consisting primarily of expenditures for replacement of equipment at manufacturing facilities 
plant turnaround costs represent cash used for the periodic scheduled major maintenance of our continuous process production facilities that is performed at each plant generally every two years 
we funded million and million of plant turnaround costs in and we estimate plant turnaround costs will approximate million

offering proceeds  existing cash balances and revolving credit lines were used to retire million of senior notes and million of bank term notes due in we have a million revolving credit facility that expires in june borrowing availability under the credit facility is generally based on eligible cash balances  of eligible accounts receivable and of eligible inventory  less outstanding letters of credit 
at december   borrowing availability exceeded the credit facility s million maximum 
there were no revolving credit borrowings and there were million in outstanding letters of credit  resulting in remaining borrowing availability of approximately million under the facility 
we are required to maintain a minimum unused borrowing availability of million 
the credit facility also requires that we adhere to certain limitations on additional debt  capital expenditures  acquisitions  liens  asset sales  investments  prepayments of subordinated indebtedness  changes in lines of business and transactions with affiliates 
in addition  if our borrowing availability falls below million  we are required to have generated million of operating cash flows  or earnings before interest income taxes  depreciation  amortization and other non cash items as defined in the credit facility for the preceding four quarters 
the amount of operating cash flows to measure credit facility compliance is different than amounts that can be derived from terra s financial statements 
for the months ended december   operating cash flows as defined in the credit facility was million 
our ability to meet credit facility covenants will depend on future operating cash flows  working capital needs  receipt of customer prepayments and trade credit terms 
failure to meet these covenants could result in additional costs and fees to amend the credit facility or could result in termination of the facility 
access to adequate bank facilities is critical to funding our operating cash needs 
based on current market conditions for our finished products and natural gas  we anticipate that we will be able to meet our covenants through nevertheless  if product margins were to be as depressed as during portions of the first half or if there were to be any adverse changes in the factors discussed above  we may need a waiver of our credit facility covenants and there is no assurance we could receive such waivers

our cash contributions to pension plans were million in and are estimated at million in  million in and million in actual contributions could vary from these estimates depending on actual returns for plan assets  legislative changes to pension funding requirements and or plan amendments 
expenditures related to environmental  health and safety regulation compliance are primarily composed of operation costs that totaled million in because environmental  health and safety regulations are expected to continue to change and generally to be more restrictive than current requirements  the costs of compliance will likely increase 
we do not expect compliance with such regulations will have a material adverse effect on the results of operations  financial position or net cash flows 

table of contents we incurred million of capital expenditures to ensure compliance with environmental  health and safety regulations 
we may be required to install additional air and water quality control equipment  such as low nitrous oxide burners  scrubbers  ammonia sensors and continuous emission monitors to continue to achieve compliance with the clean air act and similar requirements 
these equipment requirements typically apply to competitors as well 
we estimate that the cost of complying with these existing requirements in and beyond will be less than million

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management and financial instruments market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position  results of operations or cash flows due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices and rates 
we use derivative financial instruments to manage risk in the areas of a foreign currency fluctuations  b changes in natural gas prices and c changes in interest rates 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the use of derivative financial instruments 
our policy is to avoid unnecessary risk and to limit  to the extent practical  risks associated with operating activities 
our management may not engage in activities that expose terra to speculative or non operating risks and is expected to limit risks to acceptable levels 
the use of derivative financial instruments is consistent with our overall business objectives 
derivatives are used to manage operating risk within the limits established by our board of directors  and in response to identified exposures  provided they qualify as hedge activities 
as such  derivative financial instruments are used to manage exposure to interest rate fluctuations  to hedge specific assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency  to hedge firm commitments and forecasted natural gas purchase transactions  and to protect against foreign exchange rate movements between different currencies that impact revenue and earnings expressed in us dollars 
the use of derivative financial instruments subjects terra to some inherent risks associated with future contractual commitments  including market and operational risks  credit risk associated with counterparties  product location basis differentials and market liquidity 
terra continuously monitors the valuation of identified risks and adjusts the portfolio based on current market conditions 
foreign currency fluctuations our policy is to manage risk associated with foreign currency fluctuations by entering into forward exchange and option contracts covering specific currency obligations or net foreign currency operating requirements  as appropriate 
such hedging is limited to the amounts and duration of the specific obligations being hedged and  in the case of operating requirements  no more than of the forecasted requirements 
the primary currencies to which we are exposed are the canadian dollar and the british pound 
at december   we had no forward positions in any foreign currency 
natural gas prices north american operations natural gas is the principal raw material used to manufacture nitrogen and methanol 
natural gas prices are volatile and we mitigate some of this volatility through the use of derivative commodity instruments 
our current policy is to hedge of our natural gas requirements for the upcoming months and up to of requirements for the following month period  provided that such arrangements would not result in costs greater than expected selling prices for our finished products 
we notify the board of directors when we deviate from this policy 
annual north american natural gas requirements are 
table of contents approximately million mmbtu 
we have hedged of our expected north american requirements and none of our requirements beyond december  the fair value of these instruments is estimated based on quoted market prices from brokers  realized gains or losses and our computations 
these instruments fixed natural gas prices at million less than published prices for december  forward markets 
market risk is estimated as the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in price 
as of december  our market risk exposure related to future natural gas requirements being hedged was million based on a sensitivity analysis 
changes in the market value of these derivative instruments have a high correlation to changes in the spot price of natural gas 
since we forward price only a portion of our natural gas requirements  this hypothetical adverse impact on natural gas derivative instruments would be more than offset by lower costs for all natural gas we purchase 
natural gas prices united kingdom operations to meet natural gas production requirements at our united kingdom production facilities  we generally enter into one or two year gas supply contracts and fix prices for of total volume requirements 
annual procurement requirements for uk natural gas are approximately million mmbtu 
as of december   we had fixed price contracts for of our expected uk natural gas requirements and none of our natural gas requirements 
our uk fixed price contracts for natural gas were at prices million less than published prices for december  forward markets 
we do not use derivative commodity instruments for our united kingdom natural gas needs
