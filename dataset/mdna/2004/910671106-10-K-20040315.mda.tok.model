the defense segment s funded backlog increased from  at december  to  at december  the increase was generally due to the timing of the shadow tuav full rate production contract award and the timing of production on the jsecst program as well as additional orders received associated with the company s c maintenance trainer system program 
during  the company s shadow tuav along with other shadow family configurations  the shadow and shadow unmanned aerial vehicle uav systems  and the company s pioneer uav system experienced increased interest from both domestic and international customers primarily as a result of the performance of the company s uavs deployed in support of us forces in many areas of the world  including afghanistan and iraq 
at december   the company had delivered shadow tuav systems to the us army 
at december   backlog includes shadow tuav systems that are scheduled for delivery through although gross profit for the company and the defense segment increased during compared to  the gross profit as a percent of sales of the company and the defense segment decreased 
during  the program mix in the defense segment included higher gross profit international sales 
however  during  the defense segment did experience improved gross profit on domestic programs 
the decrease in defense gross profit as a percentage of sales in was also due to higher pension plan expense in  as well as an insurance recovery of  which favorably impacted gross profit in the first quarter of the us department of defense uav marketplace has expanded over the last several years 
as uavs have gained rapid acceptance within the military  and plans to reduce manned aircraft purchases are announced  the company has experienced larger manufacturers entering the company s marketplace 
some of these new competitors are the major aircraft manufacturers  including northrop grumman and boeing 
however  the company continues to invest in internal research and development initiatives to maintain the company s superior track record and technological edge over its competitors in the company s niche markets 
the company intends to maintain a strong focus on us department of defense opportunities and believes it is well positioned over the long term to benefit from the demand for advanced technological systems by the us and foreign governments 
energy sales in the energy segment decreased during due to the timing of orders and deliveries to customers 
the company recognized increased profit in the energy segment in this was primarily because of higher cost of sales during  which included costs for accelerated depreciation of assets related to the closing of midwest metallurgical laboratory  inc midwest  a former indirect subsidiary of the company in the energy segment engaged in foundry operations 
lower cost castings also contributed to the profit increase during as a result of the company outsourcing the manufacturing of castings after the closure of midwest during in  the energy segment results continued to be negatively affected by the ongoing defense of its asbestos claims

aai owns of eti and skoda  as skoda owns the remaining  although during skoda declared bankruptcy in the czech republic and has been unable to fund its obligations to eti pursuant to the shareholders agreement 
the company believes it has provided for eti s estimated muni program losses through completion 
during the fourth quarter of  it became apparent that eti would be unable to satisfy its obligations to aai as a subcontractor to eti under eti s muni contract as well as the secunded services arrangement 
consequently  aai filed a claim under muni s labor and materials bond that ensures subcontractors and others are paid 
the timing and amount  if any  of the recovery under aai s labor and materials bond claim cannot be determined at this time 
aai believes it has adequately reserved for the non payment of its receivables from eti 
in february  an agreement in principle was reached among eti  aai and muni to settle eti s contract disputes with muni 
pursuant to the proposed settlement  muni would relieve eti of its warranty and bonding obligations  as well as other obligations under the contract  except for delivery of all electric trolley buses ordered and performance of a defined scope of work related to the deliveries 
in exchange  muni would receive a release from any claims that eti might assert  a cash payment to be offset by muni from payments remaining due under the contract  and certain other consideration 
aai would agree to guaranty certain obligations of eti  make a cash payment to muni  and provide other consideration  in exchange for a release from its warranty and all further obligations under its subcontract with eti 
as a result of the release of eti from its performance bonding obligation  aai would be released from its indemnification of the surety 
the proposed settlement is subject to the approval of the board of directors of san francisco s municipal transportation agency and the company s board of directors

for further information  refer to note to the financial statements included in item of this annual report 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
judgments and assessments of uncertainties are required in applying the company s accounting policies in many areas 
for example  key assumptions are particularly important in developing the company s projected liabilities for pension and other postretirement benefits 
other areas in which significant uncertainties exist include  but are not limited to  projected costs to be incurred in connection with legal matters 
the company recognizes a liability for legal indemnification and defense costs when it believes it is probable a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
the liabilities are developed based on currently available information 
the accruals are recorded at undiscounted amounts if the company cannot reliably determine timing of the cash payments  and the amounts are classified as liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the company also has insurance that covers certain losses and records a receivable to the extent that the claim can be reasonably estimated and realization is deemed probable 
this receivable is recorded at undiscounted amounts and is classified as a non current receivable in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the company generally follows the percentage of completion method of accounting for its long term contracts 
sales and gross profit are principally recognized as work is performed based on the relationship between actual costs incurred and total estimated costs  at completion 
alternatively  certain contracts provide for the production of various units throughout the contract period  and sales and gross profit on these contracts are accounted for based on the units delivered 
amounts representing contract change orders  claims or other items are included in sales only when they can be reliably estimated and realization is probable 
incentives or penalties  estimated warranty costs and awards applicable to performance on contracts are considered in estimating sales and profit rates  and are recorded when there is sufficient information to assess anticipated contract performance 
when adjustments in contract value or estimated costs are determined  any changes from prior estimates are reflected in earnings in the current period 
anticipated losses on contracts or programs in progress are charged to earnings when identified 
although management believes that the profits are fairly stated and that adequate provisions for losses on certain of the fixed price contracts have been recorded in the financial statements  revisions to such estimates do occur and at times are material to the company s results of operations and financial position 
inventory is recorded at the lower of cost or market 
inventoried costs associated with long term contracts include costs and earnings of incomplete contracts not yet billable to the customer 
these amounts represent the difference between the percentage of completion method of accounting for long term contracts used to record operating results by the company s defense segment and the amounts billable to the customer under the terms of the specific contracts 
estimates of final contract costs and earnings including earnings subject to future determination through negotiation or other procedures are reviewed and revised periodically throughout the lives of the contracts 
the company files income tax returns and estimates income taxes in each of the taxing jurisdictions in which it operates 
the company is subject to tax audits in each of these jurisdictions  which could result in changes to the estimated taxes 
the amount of these changes would vary by jurisdiction and would be recorded when known 
management has recorded valuation allowances to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in doing so  management has considered future taxable income and on going tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance

to require companies to account for employee stock options using the fair value method  the disclosure provisions of statement no

or the intrinsic value method of opinion no 
the adoption of statement no 
did not have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
risk factors important risk factors that could cause the company s actual results to differ materially from those suggested by the company s forward looking statements contained herein include the company depends on government contracts for substantially all of its sales 
the company derives approximately of its revenue from sales to the us government and its agencies 
the company expects that the us government sales will continue to be the primary source of its revenue for the foreseeable future 
the loss of us government contracts or a delay or decline in funding of existing and future us government programs are subject to uncertain future funding levels  which can also result in the deferral or termination of programs 
the company s business is also highly sensitive to changes in national and international priorities and the us government budgets 
in addition  us government contracts typically contain provisions and are subject to laws and regulations that give the government agencies rights and remedies not typically found in commercial contracts  including providing the government agency with the ability to unilaterally terminate  reduce the value of and modify some of the terms and conditions of existing contracts  suspend or permanently prohibit the company from doing business with the us government or with any specific government agency  control and potentially prohibit the export of the company s products  and claim rights in technologies and systems invested  developed or produced by the company 
if a us government agency terminates a contract with the company for convenience  the company generally may recover only its incurred or committed costs  settlement expenses and profit on the work completed prior to termination 
if an agency terminates a contract with the company for default  the company is denied any recovery and may be liable for excess costs incurred by the agency in procuring undelivered items from an alternative source 
the company may receive show cause or cure notices under contracts that  if not addressed to the agency s satisfaction  could give the agency the right to terminate those contracts for default or to cease procuring the company s services under those contracts 
in the event that any of the company s contracts were to be terminated or adversely modified  there may be significant adverse effects on the company s revenues  operating costs and income that would not be recoverable 
as a us government contractor  the company is subject to a number of procurement rules and regulations 
the company must comply with and is affected by laws and regulations relating to the formation  administration and performance of us government contracts 
these laws and regulations  among other things  require certification and disclosure of all cost and pricing data in connection with contract negotiations  define allowable and unallowable costs and otherwise govern the company s right to reimbursement under certain cost based us government contracts  and restrict the use and dissemination of classified information and the exportation of certain products and technical data 
these laws and regulations affect how the company does business with its customers and in some instances  impose added costs on our businesses 
a violation of specific laws and regulations could result in the imposition of fines and penalties or the termination of our contracts 
the company s businesses could be adversely affected by a negative audit by the us government 
us government agencies such as the defense contract audit agency dcaa routinely audit and investigate government contractors 
these agencies review a contractor s performance under its contracts  cost structure and compliance with applicable laws  regulations and standards 
the dcaa also reviews the adequacy of  and a contractor s compliance with  its internal control systems and policies  including the contractor s purchasing  property  estimating  compensation and management information systems 
any costs found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed  while such costs already reimbursed must be refunded 
if an audit uncovers improper or illegal activities  the company may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions  including termination of contracts  forfeiture of profits  suspension of payments  fines and suspension or prohibition from doing business with the us government 
in addition  the company could suffer serious harm to its reputation if allegations of impropriety were made against it 
the company s revenues will be adversely affected if the company fails to receive renewal or follow on contracts 
renewal and follow on contracts are important because the company s contracts are for fixed terms 
these terms vary from shorter than one year to over five years  particularly for contracts with options 
the typical term of the company s contracts with the us government is between one and three years 
the loss of revenues from the company s possible failure to obtain renewal or follow on contracts may be significant because the company s us government contracts account for a substantial portion of the company s revenues 
cost over runs on the company s contracts could subject it to losses and adversely affect its future business 
approximately of the company s contracts in were firm fixed price contracts 
under firm fixed price contracts  the company performs services under a contract at a stipulated price 
if the company s initial estimates used for calculating the contract price are incorrect  the company can incur losses on those contracts because any costs in excess of the fixed price are absorbed by the company 
under time and materials contracts  the company is paid for labor at negotiated hourly billing rates and for certain expenses 
under cost reimbursement contracts  which are subject to a contract ceiling amount  the company is reimbursed for allowable costs and paid a fee  which may be fixed or performance based 
however  if costs exceed the contract ceiling or are not allowable under the provisions of the contract or applicable regulations  the company may not be able to obtain reimbursement for all such costs 
the company s ability to manage costs on each of these contract types may materially and adversely affect its financial condition 
cost over runs also may adversely affect the company s ability to sustain existing programs and obtain future contract awards 
due to the size and nature of many of the company s contracts  the estimation of total revenues and cost at completion is complicated and subject to many variables 
assumptions have to be made regarding the length of time to complete the contract because costs also include expected increases in wages and prices for materials 
incentives or penalties related to performance on contracts are considered in estimating sales and profit rates  and are recorded when there is sufficient information for the company to assess anticipated performance 
estimates of award fees are also used in estimating sales and profit rates based on actual and anticipated awards 
because of the significance of the judgments and estimation processes described above  it is likely that materially different amounts could be recorded if the company used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change 
changes in underlying assumptions  circumstances or estimates may adversely affect future period financial performance 
for additional information on accounting policies we have in place for recognizing sales and profits  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies in item of this annual report and note of the notes to financial statements included in item of this annual report 
failure to perform by one of the company s subcontractors  partners or suppliers could materially and adversely affect the company s performance and the company s ability to obtain future business 
many of the company s contracts involve subcontracts or partnerships with other companies upon which the company relies to perform a portion of the services the company must provide to its customers 
there is a risk that the company may have disputes with the company s subcontractors  including disputes regarding the quality and timeliness of work performed by the subcontractor  customer concerns about the subcontractor  the company s failure to extend existing task orders or issue new task orders under a subcontract or the company s hiring of personnel of a subcontractor 
a failure by one or more of the company s subcontractors to satisfactorily provide on a timely basis the agreed upon services may materially and adversely impact the company s ability to perform the company s obligations as the prime contractor 
subcontractor performance deficiencies could expose the company to liability and have a material adverse effect on the company s ability to compete for future contracts and orders 
in addition  in connection with certain of its contracts  the company commits to certain performance guarantees 
the ability of the company to perform under these guarantees may in part  be dependent on the performance of other parties  including partners and subcontractors 
if the company is unable to meet these performance obligations  the performance guarantees could have a material adverse effect on product margins and the company s results of operations  liquidity or financial position 
the company monitors the progress of its partners and subcontractors and does not believe that their performance will adversely affect these contracts as of december  no assurances can be given  however  as to the company s liability if the company s partners or subcontractors are unable to perform their obligations 
in addition  although the company can obtain materials and purchase components generally from a number of different suppliers  several suppliers are the company s sole source of certain components 
if a supplier should cease to deliver such components  the company would probably find other sources  however  this could result in added cost and manufacturing delays  which may affect the company s ability to meet customer needs and may have an adverse impact on the company s profitability 
the company operates in highly competitive and rapidly changing markets 
the defense industry in which the company primarily participates is highly competitive and characterized by rapid technological change 
if the company does not continue to improve existing product lines and develop new products and technologies  the company s business could be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  the company s competitors could introduce new products with greater capabilities which could also have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
in addition  in connection with certain of its contracts  the company commits to certain performance guarantees 
the ability of the company to perform under these guarantees may  in part  be dependent on the performance of other parties  including partners and subcontractors 
if the company is unable to meet these performance obligations  the performance guarantees could have a material adverse effect on product margins and the company s results of operations  liquidity or financial position 
the company monitors the progress of its partners and subcontractors and does not believe that their performance will adversely affect these contracts as of december  no assurances can be given  however  as to the company s liability if the company s partners or subcontractors are unable to perform their obligations 
the company competes primarily for government contracts against many companies that are larger than the company  devote greater resources to research and development  and generally have greater financial and other resources 
consequently  these competitors may be better positioned to take advantage of economies of scale and develop new technologies 
in order to remain competitive  the company must keep the company s capabilities technically advanced and compete on price and on value added to its customers 
the company s ability to compete may be adversely affected by limits on its capital resources and its ability to invest in maintaining and expanding the company s market share 
if the company is unable to compete effectively  its business and prospects will be adversely affected 
in addition  the company s international business is subject to changes in import and export policies  technology transfer restrictions  limitations imposed by us law that are not applicable to foreign competitors  and other legal  financial and governmental risks 
the company and its subsidiaries are subject to asbestos related and environmental litigation and other liabilities 
the company s financial condition and performance may be affected by pending litigation  including asbestos and environmental matters  and other loss contingencies  and by unanticipated liabilities 
these litigation matters and contingencies are described in note of the notes to financial statements included in item of this annual report 
although the company accounts for its transportation business as a discontinued operation  the company remains subject to significant obligations in connection with such operations 
the company accounts for its transportation business as a discontinued operation 
as such  the company is attempting to complete its obligations under its remaining contract in this business in such a way as not to expose the company to further losses 
however  as discussed in note to the notes to financial statements included in item of this annual report  the remaining obligations and potential obligations  which include performance and indemnity obligations  are significant 
therefore  although the company anticipates that eti s current program will be completed during the third quarter of and that it has adequately provided for the estimated losses including warranty obligations to be incurred by eti  there can be no assurances that the company will  in fact  be able to successfully extricate itself from its obligations and potential obligations within the stated time frame or within the established reserves 
the company s level of returns on pension plan assets could affect the company s earnings in future periods 
the company s net income or loss may be positively or negatively impacted by the amount of income or expense the company records for its pension plan 
an example of how changes in the company s assumptions related to the company s pension plan can affect the company s financial statements occurred in for a discussion regarding how the company s financial statements can be affected by pension plan accounting policies  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item of this annual report and note of the notes to financial statements included in item of this annual report 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at times  the company enters into forward exchange contracts to manage its exposure against foreign currency fluctuations on sales transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
the contract obligates the company to exchange predetermined amounts of the foreign currency at certain dates  or to make an equivalent us dollar payment equal to the value of such exchanges 
the purpose of the company s foreign exchange currency activities is to protect the company from the risk that the eventual us dollar cash flows resulting from the sale of products to international customers will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates 
gains and losses for effective hedging activities are included in other comprehensive income and recognized in earnings when the future sales occur 
gains and losses for ineffective hedges are recorded in income 
at december  the company had two foreign currency forward contracts with large financial institutions 
one for australian dollars having maturities of three years to hedge contract payments scheduled to be received within three years 
the aggregate notional value of this contract was  with an aggregate loss of  based on fair market value 
the second contract is for the delivery of euros in has a notional value totaling  with an aggregate loss of  based on fair market value 
both of these have been recorded in income 
the company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties on foreign exchange contracts 
the amount of such exposure is generally the unrealized gain or loss on such contracts 
the company does not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes
