item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
executive summary veeco designs  manufactures  markets and services a broad line of equipment primarily used by manufacturers in the data storage  semiconductor and compound semiconductor wireless industries 
veeco s instruments are also enabling advancements in the growing field of nanoscience and other areas of scientific and industrial research 
our process equipment products precisely deposit or remove etch various materials in the manufacturing of advanced thin film magnetic heads tfmhs for the data storage industry  semiconductor deposition of mask reticles  and wireless telecommunications and high brightening light emitting diode devices 
our metrology equipment is used to provide critical surface measurements on semiconductor devices and tfmhs 
this equipment allows customers to monitor their products throughout the manufacturing process in order to improve yields  reduce costs and improve product quality 
our metrology solutions are also key research instruments used by many universities  scientific laboratories and industrial applications 
during the past several years  we have strengthened both the metrology and process equipment product lines through strategic acquisitions 
in our metrology business  in june  we purchased the atomic force microscope probe business from nanodevices inc nanodevices for approximately million in cash  plus a potential future cash earn out payment of up to million based on the achievement of certain operating measures 
in our process equipment business  in november  we purchased the turbodisc business from emcore corporation for approximately million  including transaction costs  plus a potential future cash earn out payment of up to million based on the achievement of certain operating measures 
also in november  we acquired the precision bar lapping company aii for approximately million including transaction costs  plus a potential future cash earn out payment of up to million based on the achievement of certain operating measures 
while we believe the acquisitions will be accretive to both sales and profits going forward  gross margin percentages have been historically lower in process equipment businesses than metrology 
therefore  veeco s gross margin percentage may be adversely affected in the future by the higher concentration of process equipment sales 
we currently maintain manufacturing facilities in arizona  california  colorado  minnesota  new jersey  and new york  with sales and service locations around the world 
each of our products is currently manufactured in only one location  since we believe that the technological know how and precision needed to make each of our products requires specialized expertise 
the decline in the overall business environment and market conditions in and caused us to restructure our business and operations 
the cost impact of inventory write offs and restructuring expenses over the past three years has totaled approximately million 
these actions have allowed us to save approximately million in annual operating expenses and million in manufacturing labor and overhead and service costs  in compared to in  the decline in the business environment also caused us to take non cash asset impairment charges of million  including a million write down of goodwill under sfas no 
 which was the primary reason for our loss per share of 
highlights of three strategic acquisitions at a total cost of million the probes division of nanodevices  which enables veeco to provide its customers with probes designed specifically to maximize the performance of veeco s afms and accelerate our development of new afm products where advanced probe technology can be a critical element 
the turbodisc business from emcore corporation  which makes veeco the only company that provides both key compound semiconductor epitaxial deposition technologies mbe and mocvd and will enable veeco to address the full range of applications requiring the high performance aspects of compound semiconductor technologies 
the purchase of aii which makes veeco the only provider of a broad line of slider fab solutions for data storage 
net loss of million  including merger and restructuring expenses of million  and write off of in process research and development of million 
sales of million  down from million in  due to a weakened environment throughout the year 
sales include million attributable to turbodisc and aii 
orders of million  up from million in orders include million attributable to turbodisc and aii 
positive cash flow of million excluding million paid for acquired businesses  including million positive cash flow from operations 
our december  cash position is million  down from million as at december   principally resulting from the cash utilized to pay for the acquisitions of nanodevices  turbodisc  and aii 
outlook opportunities our primary objectives are as follows capitalize on the long term growth opportunities in the data storage and compound semiconductor wireless and lighting industries by expanding our process equipment and metrology technology solutions  pursue focused market opportunities in the semiconductor industry in which veeco has specific technology leadership  capitalize on the growth opportunities in scientific research instrumentation  specifically the worldwide investment in nanoscience and nanotechnology on a global basis  and invest in internally generated new products through an active research and development program  and also pursue strategic acquisitions to further expand the company s breadth of product lines to accommodate the needs of its target customer base 
the last several years have been challenging for veeco  its customers and peers due to the prolonged economic downturn and several years of under investment in technology 
at the end of veeco experienced a significant improvement in orders across its research and industrial  semiconductor and compound semiconductor wireless products  driven by increased capital expenditure across these markets 
overall  worldwide economic conditions appear to have improved 
consumer spending on many types of electronics has increased and various worldwide economies  such as those in the asia pacific region  are experiencing growth 
the company reviews a number of indicators to predict the strength of our markets going forward 
these include plant utilization trends  capacity requirements  and capital spending trends 
technology changes are continuing in all of veeco s markets the continued ramp of gb hard drives in data storage  the increased use of veeco s automated afms for sub nanometer semiconductor applications  the opportunity for veeco s mocvd and mbe to further penetrate the emerging wireless and hb led market  and the continued funding of nanoscience research 
veeco expects that the overall health of its business will improve in as compared to  and that its newer technologies acquired turbodisc and aii will add over million in revenue for compared with only a minimal contribution to veeco s performance due to the fact that these acquisitions were consummated near the end of the year 
while the company s expectations for are positive  no assurance of future performance is possible

by segment  process equipment sales were lower due to a decrease of million in etch and deposition products partially offset by million in revenues realized from the turbodisc and aii acquisitions 
the decline in etch and deposition sales was partially due to tight capital spending from our data storage customers  as well as read rite corp 
s bankruptcy in read rite accounted for million of sales in  which were not repeated in a reduction of deposition system sales to telecommunication customers resulted in lower sales to the compound semiconductor wireless industry 
sales reductions of million in mbe  million of etch and deposition and million in optical metrology  partially offset by million increases in other products  resulted in the decrease of sales to the research and industrial market 
by region  there was a shift in sales from the us to the asia pacific region 
asia pacific sales increased due to a general pickup in business across the region  including an increase in afm sales of million 
million of the sales increase in the asia pacific region was attributable to the turbodisc and aii acquisitions 
the company believes that there will continue to be year to year variations in the geographic content of sales 
orders of million were a increase over by segment  the improvement in process equipment orders was driven by a total of million in orders for turbodisc systems  partially offset by a net reduction in deposition and etch orders  including mbe 
by industry  the largest increase was a increase in compound semiconductor wireless  mostly due to million in orders received for turbodisc products 
data storage increased on higher deposition and etch orders 
research and industrial was down mostly due to a million decline in mbe orders 
semiconductor was down due to a million reduction in deposition and etch equipment orders  primarily to the lithography market  offset by improvements across other product lines 
regionally  the decline in orders in the us is mostly due to a shift to overseas production  primarily in the data storage industry 
the book to bill ratio for the year ended december   which is calculated by dividing orders received in a given time period by revenue recognized in that same time period  was to during the year ended december   the company experienced order cancellations of million  primarily in the data storage and compound semiconductor wireless industries 
the company acquired million of backlog from companies acquired in the company also experienced rescheduling of order delivery dates by customers 
due to changing business conditions and customer requirements  the company may continue to experience cancellations and or rescheduling of orders 
gross profit for the year ended december   increased to from in during the year ended december   the company incurred a million reduction in gross profit related to the acquisitions of turbodisc and aii 
the reduction was the result of purchase accounting adjustments due to the required capitalization of profit in inventory and permanent elimination of certain deferred revenue  which is included in cost of sales 
during the years ended december  and  the company incurred merger and restructuring charges of million and million  respectively  of which million  or of net sales  related to the write off of inventory in  which are included in the cost of sales 
excluding the impact of the purchase accounting adjustment in and the merger and restructuring charge in  gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to from 
the increased gross margin is mostly due to a improvement in the process equipment gross margin  primarily due to the cost savings associated with plant and personnel consolidations initiated in selling  general and administrative expenses were down million in principally due to a million decrease in selling expense  resulting from reduced personnel  occupancy and advertising spending  as well as a million decrease in administration costs  resulting from realized cost efficiencies 
such decreases were partially offset by incremental costs of million attributable to the turbodisc and aii acquisitions 
research and development expense totaled million or of sales in compared with million or of sales in this million decrease in spending resulted from efficiencies achieved through the site consolidations in the process equipment segment in the fourth quarter of this decrease was partially offset by million of incremental costs attributable to the turbodisc and aii acquisitions 
other income  net  increased by million primarily due to gains realized on the sale of assets held for sale 
merger and restructuring costs of million in  principally resulted from severance and business relocation expenses related to the cost reduction programs announced and initiated in the fourth quarter of these included the transfer of our sunnyvale afm business to santa barbara as well as severance costs incurred in the process equipment segment see note to the consolidated financial statements of the company for details 
the million write off of purchased in process technology for resulted from the turbodisc and aii acquisitions for million and million  respectively  for projects that had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternate uses 
accordingly  these amounts were expensed at the acquisition dates see note to the consolidated financial statements of the company for details on the projects included 
expenditures to complete both turbodisc s and aii s projects are subject to change  given the uncertainties of the development process  and no assurances can be given that deviations from the estimated completion dates will not occur 
additionally  the projects will require maintenance research and development after they have reached a state of technological and commercial feasibility 
there are risks associated with these projects  and there is no assurance that these projects will meet with technological or commercial success 
interest income totaled million compared to million in the comparable period 
the decrease is due to a reduction in interest income on short term investments as a result of lower interest rates plus lower cash balances due to the million cash outlay for acquired companies 
income taxes for the year ended december  amounted to a benefit of million  or of loss before income taxes as compared with a benefit of million  or of loss before income taxes in the lower tax rate in is due to million of non deductible charges taken in from the write down of goodwill

this was due to a million decline in etch and deposition product sales  principally to the data storage market  as well as a million decrease in optical filter deposition sales to the telecommunications industry partially offset by a million increase in mbe sales by the company s applied epi subsidiary  acquired in september metrology sales were also affected  primarily by the downturn in the semiconductor industry causing a decrease of million from million in the year ended december  this decrease was attributable to a million decrease in the sale of afms  primarily to the semiconductor and research industrial industries  as well as a million decrease in optical interferometry sales  predominantly to the data storage and semiconductor industries  partially offset by a million increase in sales of other optical metrology products 
the decrease in us sales was primarily attributable to an million decrease in process equipment sales  due primarily to a decline of million in sales of ion beam deposition products to the optical telecommunications industry  as well as a decrease of million in sales of etch and deposition products to the data storage industry 
the decrease in us process equipment sales was offset slightly by a million increase in the sale of mbe equipment to the telecommunications and research industries by the company s applied epi subsidiary  which was acquired in september  in a transaction using the purchase method of accounting 
sales decreases in europe and japan were primarily attributable to the drop in process equipment sales  principally in etch and deposition products 
sales in asia pacific increased principally due to a million increase in the sale of etch and deposition products to data storage customers 
the company believes that there will continue to be year to year variations in the geographic concentration of sales 
veeco received million of orders for the year ended december   representing a decrease from million of orders in the comparable period 
process equipment orders decreased primarily due to the continued downturn in the data storage and telecommunications industries 
orders for etch and deposition equipment  sold primarily to the data storage industry  decreased million  from the prior year  while orders for optical filter deposition equipment decreased million from the comparable period 
the decrease in process equipment orders was offset in part by a million increase in mbe orders from the applied epi subsidiary acquired in september of  primarily to telecommunications and research customers 
metrology orders increased by million to million  reflecting a increase in orders for afms as well as a increase in orders for optical metrology products 
the book to bill ratio for the year ended december   which is calculated by dividing orders received in a given time period by revenue recognized in that same time period  was to for the year ended december   the company experienced order cancellations of million  the majority of which related to the data storage and optical telecommunications market 
the company also experienced rescheduling of order delivery dates by customers 
during the years ended december  and  the company incurred merger and restructuring charges of million and million  respectively  of which million  or of net sales  and million  or of net sales  respectively  related to the write off of inventory  which is included in cost of sales 
gross profit for the year ended december   decreased to from in excluding the merger and restructuring charges in both years  gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to from 
the decreased gross margin is primarily due to the significant volume decrease from the prior year  particularly in process equipment sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses of million represented a higher percentage of sales in due to the decrease in sales volume from the dollar decrease was principally attributable to a decrease in selling and commission expense resulting from the decreased sales volume  as well as cost reduction efforts implemented by the company 
the decrease was partially offset by a million increase in selling  general and administrative expenses of the applied epi and tm subsidiaries  both of which were acquired by the company during the third quarter of research and development expense for the year ended december   of million represented a decrease of million  or  from the comparable period of  primarily due to cost reduction efforts implemented by the company in all product areas  except for afm 
this decrease was offset in part by the impact of million in research and development expense of applied epi and tm 
amortization expense for the year ended december   of million represented an increase of million from the comparable period of  due primarily to the intangible assets acquired during the third quarter of in connection with the applied epi and tm acquisitions 
this amount was offset in part by million of reduced amortization expense in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which became effective on january  under sfas goodwill is no longer amortizable and is to be reviewed annually for impairment 
as previously mentioned  the company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of due to cost reduction efforts in response to continuing poor industry conditions  the decreased order level throughout the year and in conjunction with the plan announced by the company in october to reduce operating costs by million in  the company recorded merger and restructuring charges of approximately million during  excluding inventory write offs see note to the consolidated financial statements of the company for details on this charge 
in light of the economic conditions in  as well as the significant decline in process equipment sales during such period  the company implemented a plan to rationalize certain product lines  which required discontinuance or modification of several products 
as a result of the significant reduction in sales volume and the rationalization of product lines  excess plant capacity existed 
part of the plan to reduce future operating costs consisted of consolidation or elimination of certain facilities resulting in the reduction of excess capacity 
the plan included closing two process equipment manufacturing facilities  in fort collins  colorado and rochester  new york 
the manufacturing activities of the rochester facility ceased as of december   and have been relocated to the company s plainview  new york facility 
the manufacturing activities of the fort collins facility are in the process of being phased out  and will also be transferred to the company s plainview  new york facility 
as a result of this reorganization  the company recorded an inventory write down of approximately million 
in connection with these actions  certain products sold to the data storage industry were discontinued 
these products include certain physical vapor deposition equipment 
a portion of this product line s inventory is not useable and thus has been written off by the company 
the million charge also included the discontinuance or modification of certain telecommunications product lines  due to the continued decline in the telecommunications industry 
this industry has seen a significant decline due to excess of fiber optic capacity created by telephonic carriers as well as current economic conditions  which have resulted in a significant decrease in capital spending 
in conjunction with the restructuring in the process equipment segment and the closure of two manufacturing facilities  the company has classified the two facilities as held for sale as of december  in accordance with sfas no 
 the values of these facilities are measured at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
accordingly  an impairment charge of million was recorded by the company 
fair value was determined by the company based upon recent market data 
land  buildings and other fixed assets held for sale of approximately million are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at december  the sale of these two facilities is expected to occur by mid year of certain machinery and equipment and furniture and fixtures with a net book value of million  the majority of which is a result of the closing of the rochester facility  were deemed to have no future value and  thus  the company has written off those assets and has included this charge in asset impairment in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  as a result of the rochester facility being available for sale  the company paid down a term loan and mortgage related to the building 
due to the prepayment of the term loan  the company was required to pay a penalty of approximately million in december  which is included in the merger and restructuring charge in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  other income  net  for the year ended december  improved to million over the comparable period from other expense  net  of million  due to a decrease in foreign currency exchange losses  which occurred principally in the first quarter of interest expense  net  of million for the year ended december   increased million from the comparable period as a result of the issuance of million of convertible subordinated notes  which occurred in december and january income taxes for the year ended december  amounted to a benefit of million  or of loss before income taxes  as compared with income tax expense of million  or of income before income taxes in the lower effective tax rate for is due to approximately million of non deductible charges related to the write down of goodwill under sfas no 
in connection with the sale of its industrial measurement segment in may  the company recorded an additional million loss on the disposal of the discontinued operations during the year ended december   net of approximately million of taxes 
liquidity and capital resources veeco s primary source of funds at december   consisted of million of cash and cash equivalents 
this amount represents a decrease of million from the december  balance of million 
the decrease was primarily due to million in payments for the net assets acquired in connection with the nanodevices  turbodisc and aii acquisitions 
if these items are excluded  the company generated million in cash in the company s primary future cash commitment is in  when the million of convertible subordinated notes mature 
the notes are convertible  at the option of the holder  at any time on or prior to maturity into shares of common stock at a conversion price of per share and are redeemable by veeco under certain circumstances 
see note to the consolidated financial statements of the company for details 
cash provided by operations totaled million during the year ended december  of the cash generated  million was derived from adjusting the net loss of million for non cash charges of million  including million in depreciation and amortization expense 
the balance of million is from changes in operating assets and liabilities  net of acquisitions  including cash generated from decreases in accounts receivable and inventory of million and million  respectively  and an increase in accounts payable of million  partially offset by a cash use for reduced accrued expenses  deferred profit and other current assets and liabilities  net  of million 
accounts receivable decreased due to better collection rates and a lower mix of outstanding receivables in japan at the end of the year  where payment terms are longer than in the other geographic regions served by veeco 
receivables generally are due within days  other than customers in japan where payment terms range from days 
these items were offset by decreases in accrued expenses  deferred profit and other current assets and liabilities  net  of million 
deferred profit for the year ended december   decreased by million due to a decrease in amounts deferred for systems that were shipped but revenue was not recognized  under sab  see note to the consolidated financial statements of the company for details 
accrued expenses and other current liabilities excluding deferred profit decreased million  primarily as a result of a million reduction in taxes payable other than income taxes  a million reduction in merger and restructuring costs  million reduced bonus and commission accruals  million in reduced non sab related deferred revenues  and million in all other accrual reductions 
cash used in investing activities of million for the year ended december  are a result of the million in payments for the business acquired  as noted above  plus capital expenditures of million and million placed into escrow pending indemnity claims  if any  relating to the aii purchase 
the company has an offsetting liability for half of this amount in long term liabilities  in accordance with the aii purchase contract 
under the terms of the escrow agreement  which terminates in november  the remaining balance in the escrow account upon termination will be disbursed to veeco and the former aii shareholders equally 
partially offsetting these cash uses were proceeds from the sale of property  plant and equipment of million and net maturities of long term investments of million 
cash provided by financing activities in totaled million 
the generation of cash from financing activities in primarily resulted from stock issuances 
in december  the company issued million of convertible subordinated notes  and in january  the company issued an additional million of notes pursuant to an over allotment option 
the notes are convertible  at the option of the holder  at any time on or prior to maturity into shares of common stock at a conversion price of per share 
the company pays interest on these notes on june and december of each year 
the notes will mature on december  in connection with this offering  the company purchased approximately million of us government securities  which were pledged to the trustee under the indenture governing the notes  as security for the exclusive benefit of the holders of the notes 
these securities will be sufficient to provide for the payment in full of the first six scheduled interest payments due on the notes and thus represent restricted investments 
the balance of these pledged securities as of december  was million 
except with respect to these pledged securities  the notes are subordinated in right of payment to substantially all other indebtedness of the company 
the notes are repayable upon certain change of control events and upon the acceleration of certain other indebtedness for money borrowed of the company 
after the third anniversary of issuance  the notes may be redeemed at the option of the company at the redemption prices set forth in the indenture relating to the notes 
on april   the company entered into a million revolving credit facility as amended  the facility 
the facility s interest rate is a floating rate based on the prime rate of the lending banks and is adjustable to a maximum rate of above the prime rate in the event the company s ratio of debt to cash flows exceeds a defined amount 
a libor based interest rate option is also provided 
the facility has a term of four years and borrowings under the facility may be used for general corporate purposes  including working capital and acquisitions 
the facility contains certain restrictive covenants  which among other things  impose limitations with respect to the incurrence of indebtedness  the payment of dividends  long term leases  investments  mergers  acquisitions  consolidations and sales of assets 
the company is also required to satisfy certain financial tests and the accounts receivable of the company and its material domestic subsidiaries are pledged to secure the company s obligations under the facility 
in connection with an amendment of the facility  certain financial covenants were amended to allow for the restructuring charges and acquisitions 
certain definitions were also amended in the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of as of december   and for all prior periods  the company was in compliance with the covenants set forth in the facility 
as of december   there were no borrowings outstanding under the facility  and the company had no letters of credit outstanding under the facility 
in october  the company repaid one of its mortgages upon maturity in the amount of approximately million 
at december   veeco s contractual cash obligations and commitments relating to its debt obligations and lease payments are as follows in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years after years long term debt     operating leases      letters of credit purchase commitments   the company believes that existing cash balances together with cash generated from operations and amounts available under the company s million facility will be sufficient to meet the company s projected working capital and other cash flow requirements for the next twelve months  as well as the company s contractual obligations  detailed in the above table  over the next three years 
the company believes it will be able to meet its obligation to repay the million subordinated notes that mature on december  through a combination of conversion of the notes outstanding  refinancing  cash generated from operations  and or other means 
the company is potentially liable for payment of earn out features to the former owners of the businesses acquired in based on revenue targets achieved by the acquired businesses 
the maximum amount of these contingent liabilities is million to the former shareholders of aii over a three year period  million to nanodevices  inc  over a three year period  and million to emcore corporation  the former owner of turbodisc  over a two year period 
any amounts payable are to be paid during the first quarter of   and to the former owners of aii and nanodevices and during the first quarter of and to the former owner of turbodisc 
each payment is based on a set percentage for revenues in excess of certain targets for the preceding fiscal year 
therefore  it is not possible to calculate the amounts  if any  that may be due for each year 
application of critical accounting policies general veeco s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon veeco s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires veeco to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to bad debts  inventories  intangible assets and other long lived assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  restructuring costs and contingent litigation 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company considers certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition  the valuation of inventories  the impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets and the impairment of long lived assets to be critical policies due to the estimation processes involved in each 
revenue recognition effective january   the company changed its method for accounting for revenue recognition in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
in december  the sec issued sab no 
 revenue recognition  which updates the guidance provided in sab  integrates the related frequently asked questions  and recognizes the role of the fasb s emerging issues task force eitf consensus on issue sab deletes certain interpretive material no longer necessary  and conforms the remaining interpretative material retained to the pronouncements issued by the eitf on various revenue recognition topics  including eitf it further clarifies that a company should first refer to eitf in order to determine if there is more than one unit of accounting and then to refer to sab for revenue recognition for the unit of accounting 
the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the seller s price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
for products produced according to the company s published specifications  where no installation is required or installation is deemed perfunctory and no substantive customer acceptance provisions exist  revenue is recognized when title passes to the customer  generally upon shipment 
for products produced according to a particular customer s specifications  revenue is recognized when the product has been tested and it has been demonstrated that it meets the customer s specifications and title passes to the customer 
the amount of revenue recorded is reduced by the amount of any customer retention generally to  which is not payable by the customer until installation is completed and final customer acceptance is achieved 
installation is not deemed to be essential to the functionality of the equipment since installation does not involve significant changes to the features or capabilities of the equipment or building complex interfaces and connections 
in addition  the equipment could be installed by the customer or other vendors and generally the cost of installation approximates only to of the sales value of the related equipment 
for new products  new applications of existing products  or for products with substantive customer acceptance provisions where performance cannot be fully assessed prior to meeting customer specifications at the customer site  revenue is recognized upon completion of installation and receipt of final customer acceptance 
since title to goods generally passes to the customer upon shipment and to of the contract amount becomes payable at that time  inventory is relieved and accounts receivable is recorded for the entire contract amount 
the profit on these transactions is deferred and recorded as deferred profit in the accompanying balance sheets 
at december  and  million and million  respectively  are recorded in deferred profit 
service and maintenance contract revenues are recorded as deferred revenue  which is included in other accrued expenses  and recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the service period of the related contract 
the company provides for warranty costs at the time the related revenue is recognized 
inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost principally first in  first out method or market 
management evaluates the need to record adjustments for impairment of inventory on a quarterly basis 
the company s policy is to assess the valuation of all inventories  including raw materials  work in process  finished goods and spare parts 
obsolete inventory or inventory in excess of management s estimated usage for the next to month s requirements is written down to its estimated market value  if less than its cost 
inherent in the estimates of market value are management s estimates related to veeco s future manufacturing schedules  customer demand  technological and or market obsolescence  possible alternative uses and ultimate realization of excess inventory 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset impairment the company has significant intangible assets related to goodwill and other acquired intangibles 
in assessing the recoverability of the company s goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets  the company must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if it is determined that impairment indicators are present and that the assets will not be fully recoverable  their carrying values are reduced to estimated fair value 
impairment indicators include  among other conditions  cash flow deficits  an historic or anticipated decline in revenue or operating profit  adverse legal or regulatory developments and a material decrease in the fair value of some or all of the assets 
assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows generated by other asset groups 
changes in strategy and or market conditions could significantly impact these assumptions  and thus veeco may be required to record impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded 
the company completed the first of the required impairment tests on goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets in the first quarter of based upon the judgment of management  it was determined that there was no impairment to goodwill or intangibles with indefinite lives as of january  during the fourth quarter of  management determined that due to the continued weakness in the telecommunications industry and the uncertainty of the timing and speed of recovery  impairment indicators were present 
under sfas no 
 if impairment indicators are present  the fair value of the reporting unit must be determined 
based upon the judgment of management  goodwill arising from the september applied epi acquisition which is included in the compound semiconductor equipment reporting unit  included in the process equipment operating segment  was deemed significantly impaired 
as a result  the company recorded an impairment charge of million and has written down goodwill related to the compound semiconductor equipment reporting unit to approximately million as of december  during the fourth quarter of  as required  the company performed an annual impairment test  and based upon the judgment of management  it was determined that no impairment exists 
long lived asset impairment the carrying values of long lived assets are periodically reviewed to determine if any impairment indicators are present 
if it is determined that such indicators are present and the review indicates that the assets will not be fully recoverable  based on undiscounted estimated cash flows over the remaining depreciation period  their carrying values are reduced to estimated fair value 
impairment indicators include  among other conditions  cash flow deficits  an historic or anticipated decline in revenue or operating profit  adverse legal or regulatory developments and a material decrease in the fair value of some or all of the assets 
assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there is identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows generated by other asset groups 
during there were no indicators of impairment present 
the company recorded million and million of fixed asset impairment charges in and  respectively 
assumptions utilized by management in reviewing for impairment of long lived assets could be effected by changes in strategy and or market conditions which may require veeco to record additional impairment charges for these assets  as well as impairment charges on other long lived assets not previously recorded 
during december  approximately million of intangible assets were written off in connection with a phased out product line 
deferred taxes as part of the process of preparing veeco s consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure  together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
the measurement of deferred tax assets is adjusted by a valuation allowance to recognize the extent to which  more likely than not  the future tax benefits will be recognized 
at december   we have deferred tax assets  net of valuation allowances  of million 
we believe it is more likely than not that we will be able to realize these assets through the reduction of future taxable income 
we record valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
in assessing the adequacy of recorded valuation allowances  we consider a variety of factors including  the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  future taxable income  and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
should we determine that we are unable to use all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income tax expense  thereby reducing net income in the period such determination was made 
risk factors that may impact future results in addition to the other information set forth herein  the following risk factors should be carefully considered by shareholders of and potential investors in the company 
the cyclicality of the microelectronics industries we serve directly affects our business 
veeco s business depends in large part upon the capital expenditures of data storage  compound semiconductor wireless and semiconductor manufacturers  as well as research and industrial customers  which accounted for the following percentages of our net sales for the periods indicated year ended december  data storage compound semiconductor wireless semiconductor research and industrial veeco is subject to the business cycles of these industries  the timing  length and volatility of which are difficult to predict 
these industries have historically been highly cyclical and have experienced significant economic downturns in the last decade 
as a capital equipment provider  our revenues depend in large part on the spending patterns of these customers  who often delay expenditures or cancel or reschedule orders in reaction to variations in their businesses or general economic conditions 
in downturns  we must be able to quickly and effectively align our costs with prevailing market conditions  as well as motivate and retain key employees 
however  because a high proportion of our costs are fixed  our ability to reduce expenses quickly in response to revenue shortfalls is limited 
a downturn in one or more of these industries could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
during periods of rapid growth  we must be able to acquire and or develop sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet customer demand  and attract  hire  assimilate and retain a sufficient number of qualified people 
we cannot give assurances that our net sales and operating results will not be adversely affected if our customers experience economic downturns or slowdowns in their businesses 
we operate in a highly competitive industry characterized by rapid technological change 
the data storage  compound semiconductor wireless  semiconductor and research and industrial industries are subject to rapid technological change 
our ability to remain competitive depends on our ability to enhance existing products and develop new products in a timely and cost effective manner and to accurately predict technology transitions 
because new product development commitments must be made well in advance of sales  we must anticipate the future demand for products in selecting which development programs to fund and pursue 
we cannot be certain that we will be successful in selecting  developing  manufacturing and marketing new products or in enhancing existing products 
many of our competitors have greater financial  engineering  manufacturing and marketing resources than us 
in addition  we face competition from smaller emerging equipment companies whose strategy is to provide a portion of the products and services we offer  using innovative technology to sell products into specialized markets 
new product introductions or enhancements by our competitors could cause a decline in sales or loss of market acceptance of our existing products 
increased competitive pressure could also lead to intensified price competition resulting in lower margins 
our failure to compete successfully with these other companies would seriously harm our business 
in addition  a substantial investment is required by customers to install and integrate capital equipment into a production line 
as a result  once a manufacturer has selected a particular vendor s capital equipment  we believe that the manufacturer generally relies upon that equipment for the specific production line application and frequently will attempt to consolidate its other capital equipment requirements with the same vendor 
accordingly  if a customer selects a competitor s product over ours for technical superiority or other reasons  we could experience difficulty selling to that customer for a significant period of time 
we depend on a limited number of customers that operate in highly concentrated industries 
our customer base is and has been highly concentrated 
orders from a relatively limited number of customers have accounted for  and likely will continue to account for  a substantial portion of our net sales  which may lead customers to demand pricing and other terms less favorable to us 
based on net sales  seagate technology  inc is our largest customer 
the following table sets forth the percentage of our net sales to seagate our only customer with sales greater than in any of the past three years for the following periods year ended december  seagate technology seagate is also the principal customer for aii  which we recently acquired  and accounted for   and million of aii s net sales for its fiscal years  and  respectively 
as a result  seagate is expected to account for a greater percentage of veeco s net sales in the near future 
if a principal customer discontinues its relationship with us or suffers economic setbacks  our business  financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
our ability to increase sales in the future will depend in part upon our ability to obtain orders from new customers 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to do so 
in addition  because a relatively small number of large manufacturers  many of whom are our customers  dominate the industries in which they operate  it may be especially difficult for us to replace these customers if we lose their business 
a substantial portion of orders in our backlog are orders from our principal customers 
furthermore  we do not have long term contracts with our customers 
as a result  our agreements with our customers do not provide any assurance of future sales and we are exposed to competitive price pressure on each new order we attempt to obtain 
our failure to obtain new sales orders from new or existing customers  would have a negative impact on our results of operations 
our quarterly operating results fluctuate significantly 
our quarterly results have fluctuated significantly in the past and we expect this trend to continue 
factors which affect our quarterly results  in addition to the other risk factors described herein  include the timing of significant orders  shipments and customer acceptance of our products  rescheduling or cancellations of customer orders  difficulties in manufacturing or meeting technical specifications  changes in product mix and the cost of materials  and our acquisitions and financings 
we derive a substantial portion of our net sales in any fiscal period from the sale of a relatively small number of high priced systems 
as a result  the timing of recognition of revenue for a single transaction could have a material effect on our sales and operating results for a particular fiscal period 
as is typical in our industry  orders  shipments and customer acceptances often occur during the last few weeks of a quarter 
as a result  delay of only a week or two can often shift the related booking or net sales into the next quarter  which could adversely affect our reported results for the prior quarter 
in addition  customer purchase orders are subject to cancellation or rescheduling by the customer  generally with limited or no penalties 
in limited circumstances  we have permitted major customers to return previously shipped products in order to maintain business relationships with such customers 
backlog adjustments for the year ended december  included order cancellations of million 
historically  we have experienced long and unpredictable sales cycles ie  the period between our initial contact with a potential customer and the time when we recognize revenue from that customer 
our sales cycle can range up to twelve months 
the timing of an order often depends on the capital expenditure budget cycle of our customers  which is completely out of our control 
in addition  the time it takes us to build a product to customer specifications the build cycle typically ranges from one to six months  followed in certain cases by a period of customer acceptance during which the customer evaluates the performance of the system and may potentially reject the system 
as a result of the build cycle and evaluation periods  the period between a customer s initial purchase decision and revenue recognition on an order often varies widely  and variations in length of this period can cause further fluctuations in our operating results 
many of these factors are beyond our control 
if our orders  shipments  net sales or operating results in a particular quarter do not meet expectations  our stock price may be adversely affected 
our acquisition strategy subjects us to risks associated with evaluating and pursuing these opportunities and integrating these businesses 
we have considered numerous acquisition opportunities and completed several significant acquisitions in the past 
we may consider acquisitions of  or investments in  other businesses in the future 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  many of which are unpredictable and beyond our control  including difficulties and increased costs in integrating the personnel  operations  technologies and products of acquired companies  diversion of management s attention while evaluating  pursuing and integrating the business to be acquired  potential loss of key employees of acquired companies  especially if a relocation or change in responsibilities is involved  difficulties in managing geographically dispersed operations in a cost effective manner  lack of synergy or inability to realize expected synergies  and possible write down of acquired intangible assets as a result of technological advancements or worse than expected performance by the acquired company 
our inability to effectively manage these risks could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
in addition  if we issue equity securities to pay for an acquisition  the ownership percentage of our then existing shareholders would be reduced and the value of the shares held by these shareholders could be diluted  which could adversely affect the price of our stock and convertible subordinated notes 
if we use cash to pay for an acquisition  the payment could significantly reduce the cash that would be available to fund our operations or other purposes  including making payments on the convertible subordinated notes 
in  we used approximately million of cash to complete the acquisitions 
there can be no assurance that financing for future acquisitions will be available on favorable terms or at all 
our inability to attract  retain and motivate key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our success depends upon our ability to attract  retain and motivate key employees  including those in managerial  engineering  marketing and other roles 
in particular  we depend on our chairman and chief executive officer  edward h 
braun 
our growth is dependent on our ability to attract  retain and motivate highly skilled and qualified technical personnel  in addition to personnel that can implement and monitor our financial and managerial controls and reporting systems 
attracting  retaining and motivating qualified personnel may be difficult due to challenging industry conditions  competition for such personnel by other technology companies  consolidations and relocations of operations and workforce reductions 
our inability to attract  retain and motivate key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or operating results 
we are exposed to the risks of operating a global business 
approximately of our net sales and of our net sales were generated from sales outside the united states 
we expect sales from non us markets to continue to represent a significant  and possibly increasing  portion of our sales in the future 
our non us sales and operations are subject to risks inherent in conducting business abroad  many of which are outside our control  including difficulties in managing a global enterprise  including staffing  managing distributors and representatives and repatriation of earnings  difficulties in obtaining us export licenses in connection with sales of products to customers in certain geographic regions  including china and asia pacific  a particular disadvantage relative to our non us competitors who are not required to comply with us export controls  fluctuations in the relative values of currencies  periodic regional economic downturns and unstable political environments  longer sales cycles and difficulty in collecting accounts receivable  and multiple  conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations  including import export controls and other trade barriers 
many of these challenges are present in china  a large potential market for the company s products and an area that we anticipate will present a significant opportunity for growth 
instability in china and other foreign economies may continue and recur again in the future  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  political instability  terrorism  acts of war or epidemics in regions where we operate may adversely affect our business and results of operations 
we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks that are inherent in our anticipated sales  sales commitments and assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar 
although we attempt to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates  these hedging activities may not always be available or adequate to eliminate  or even mitigate  the impact of our exchange rate exposure 
failure to sufficiently hedge or otherwise manage foreign currency risks properly could materially and adversely affect our revenues and gross margins 
we also are exposed to interest rate risks inherent in our debt obligations and investment portfolios 
our success depends on protection of our intellectual property rights 
we may be subject to claims of intellectual property infringement by others 
our success depends in part upon the protection of our intellectual property rights 
we own various united states and international patents and have additional pending patent applications relating to certain of our products and technologies 
the process of seeking patent protection is lengthy and expensive  and we cannot be certain that pending or future applications will actually result in issued patents or that issued patents will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or commercial advantage 
in addition  our intellectual property rights may be circumvented  invalidated or rendered obsolete by the rapid pace of technological change 
furthermore  the laws of other countries may less effectively protect our proprietary rights  compared to us laws 
infringement of our rights by a third party could result in uncompensated lost market and revenue opportunities 
from time to time we have received communications from other parties asserting the existence of patent or other rights which they believe cover certain of our products 
we also periodically receive notice from customers who believe that we are required to indemnify them for damages they may incur related to infringement claims made against these customers by third parties 
our customary practice is to evaluate such assertions and to consider the available alternatives  including whether to seek a license  if appropriate 
however  we cannot ensure that licenses can be obtained or  if obtained  will be on acceptable terms or that costly litigation or other administrative proceedings will not occur 
if we are not able to resolve a claim  negotiate a settlement of the matter  obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms  and or successfully prosecute or defend our position  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
on september   we commenced a lawsuit against asylum research inc  a privately held company founded by former veeco employees 
the suit alleges infringement of five patents relating to our afm technologies 
we are seeking monetary damages and a permanent injunction to stop infringement 
asylum has asserted that the patents we are suing on are invalid and unenforceable and has filed a counterclaim for infringement of a patent licensed by asylum and payment of royalties it believes it is owed 
we believe asylum s claims are without merit 
nonetheless  the costs of pursuing this matter are significant and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in this matter 
we rely on a limited number of suppliers 
failure of the suppliers of critical parts  components and manufacturing equipment to deliver sufficient quantities in a timely and cost effective manner could adversely affect our business 
we generally do not have guaranteed supply or pricing arrangements with our suppliers 
as a result  we risk increased cost of materials and difficulty in procuring the parts we need to fill customer orders 
we currently use numerous suppliers  however  some key parts may be obtained only from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers 
failure of any of these suppliers to perform in a timely or quality manner could negatively impact our revenues and results of operations 
we may not obtain sufficient affordable funds to finance our future needs 
we may need to make significant capital expenditures to continue our operations and to enhance our manufacturing capability to keep pace with rapidly changing technologies 
also  our industry is characterized by the need for continued investment in research and development 
if we fail to invest sufficiently in research and development  our products could become less attractive to potential customers 
as a result of our emphasis on research and development and technological innovation  our operating costs may increase in the future 
during the past few years  the markets for equity and debt securities have fluctuated significantly  especially with respect to technology related companies  and during some periods offerings of those securities have been extremely difficult to complete 
as a result  in the future we may not be able to obtain the additional funds required to fund our operations and invest sufficiently in research and development on reasonable terms  or at all 
such a lack of funds could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
we are subject to risks of non compliance with environmental and safety regulations 
we are subject to environmental and safety regulations in connection with our business operations  including but not limited to regulations related to the development  manufacture and use of our products 
failure or inability to comply with existing or future environmental and safety regulations could result in significant remediation liabilities  the imposition of fines and or the suspension or termination of development  manufacture or use of certain of our products  each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have adopted certain measures that may have anti takeover effects which may make an acquisition of our company by another company more difficult 
we have adopted and may in the future adopt certain measures that may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a takeover or other change in control of veeco that a holder of our common stock might consider in its best interest 
these measures include blank check preferred stock  classified board of directors  shareholder rights plan or poison pill  and certain certificate of incorporation and bylaws provisions 
our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to fix the rights including voting rights  preferences and privileges of these shares blank check preferred 
such preferred stock may have rights  including economic rights  senior to our common stock 
as a result  the issuance of the preferred stock could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock and could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding common stock 
our board of directors is divided into three classes with each class serving a staggered three year term 
the existence of a classified board will make it more difficult for the shareholders to change the composition and therefore the policies of our board in a relatively short period of time 
we have adopted a shareholder rights plan  under which we have granted to our shareholders rights to purchase shares of junior participating preferred stock 
these rights could discourage a takeover that is not approved by our board of directors but which a shareholder might consider in its best interest  thereby adversely affecting our stock price 
we have adopted certain certificate of incorporation and bylaws provisions which may have anti takeover effects 
these include a requiring certain actions to be taken at a meeting of shareholders rather than by written consent  b requiring a super majority of shareholders to call a special meeting of shareholders or to approve certain amendments to our bylaws  c limiting the maximum number of directors  and d providing that directors may be removed only for cause 
these measures and those described above may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a takeover or other change in control of veeco that a holder of our common stock might consider in its best interest 
in addition  we are subject to the provisions of section of the general corporation law of the state of delaware  which prohibits a delaware corporation from engaging in any business combination  including mergers and asset sales  with an interested stockholder generally  a or greater stockholder for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder  unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner 
the operation of section may have anti takeover effects  which could delay  defer or prevent a takeover attempt that a holder of our common stock might consider in its best interest 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk the principal market risks ie the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices to which the company is exposed are rates on debt and short term and long term investment portfolios  and exchange rates  generating translation and transaction gains and losses 
interest rates veeco centrally manages its debt and investment portfolios considering investment opportunities and risks  tax consequences and overall financing strategies 
veeco s investment portfolios consist of cash equivalents and obligations of us government agencies 
these investments in obligations of the us government are considered held to maturity securities 
accordingly  the amounts are carried at amortized cost 
assuming year end variable debt and investment levels  a one point change in interest rates would not have a material impact on net interest expense 
in december and january  the company issued an aggregate of million of convertible subordinated notes 
the notes are convertible  at the option of the holder  at any time on or prior to maturity into shares of common stock at a conversion price of per share 
the company pays interest on these notes on june and december of each year 
interest payments commenced on june  see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the notes will mature on december  after the third anniversary of the issuance  the notes may be redeemed at the option of the company  at the redemption prices set forth in the indenture 
foreign operations operating in international markets involves exposure to movements in currency exchange rates  which are volatile at times 
the economic impact of currency exchange rate movements on veeco is complex because such changes are often linked to variability in real growth  inflation  interest rates  governmental actions and other factors 
these changes  if material  could cause the company to adjust its financing and operating strategies 
consequently  isolating the effect of changes in currency does not incorporate these other important economic factors 
veeco s net sales to foreign customers represented approximately of veeco s total net sales in  in and in the company expects that net sales to foreign customers will continue to represent a large percentage of veeco s total net sales 
veeco s net sales denominated in foreign currencies represented approximately of veeco s total net sales in  in and in the aggregate foreign exchange gains losses included in determining consolidated results of operations were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in  and  the foreign currency exchange gain loss is net of approximately  and million of realized hedging losses gains  respectively  which were recorded and included in other income expense  net 
as of december   approximately million of losses related to forward contracts are included in accrued expenses and have been subsequently paid in january on december   the company entered into forward contracts for the month of january for the notional amount of million  which approximated the market value at december  veeco is exposed to financial market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
to mitigate these risks  veeco uses derivative financial instruments 
veeco does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
the company enters into monthly forward contracts to reduce the effect of fluctuating foreign currencies on short term foreign currency denominated intercompany transactions and other known currency exposures 
the average notional amount of such contracts outstanding was approximately million for the year ended december  the changes in currency exchange rates that have the largest impact on translating veeco s international operating loss profit are the japanese yen and the euro 
the company estimates that based upon its balance sheet at december   a change in foreign exchange rates impact operating loss by approximately million 
the company believes that this quantitative measure has inherent limitations because  as discussed in the first paragraph of this section  it does not take into account any governmental actions or changes in either customer purchasing patterns or our financing and operating strategies
