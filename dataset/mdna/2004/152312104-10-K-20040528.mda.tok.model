fiscal year represents our eighth consecutive year of growth in revenues and earnings from continuing operations 
as outlined in the charts above  in revenues increased to billion and 
table of contents earnings from continuing operations increased to billion 
the increase in revenues and operating earnings is primarily the result of the operating results of our home building segment  complemented by improved operating results of our financial services segment 
the growth in operating earnings from these segments was offset  to a much lesser extent  by a decline in operating earnings of our construction services segment 
in addition to the execution of our organic growth strategy in our primary business segments home building  financial services and construction services  in fiscal year  we also i distributed per share  split adjusted  in value to our stockholders through the spin off of substantially all of our manufactured housing operations  ii distributed per share  split adjusted  in value to our stockholders through the spin off of our construction products segment  iii repurchased  shares of common stock and iv completed a two for one stock split  without changing the per share dividend  effectively doubling our cash dividend to stockholders beginning in the fourth quarter 
home building s organic growth strategy is driven primarily by growth in neighborhoods open for sale  increases in closings per neighborhood  increases in average selling prices  and continued improvements in operating margins 
over the last two fiscal years  home building s domestic operations have increased average neighborhood count from to and closings per average neighborhood from to over that same period of time  operating margins have also improved from to 
the overall demand for housing in the united states remains favorable  and is driven by population growth  demographics  immigration  household formations and increasing home ownership rates 
short term growth drivers such as mortgage rates  consumer confidence and employment levels can also impact housing demand 
the highly fragmented homebuilding industry in the united states is in the early stages of a consolidation phase 
in  based upon single family permits issued in the united states  the largest homebuilders represented approximately of the housing market 
as of  the largest homebuilders were producing approximately of the nation s new housing stock 
we believe industry consolidation will continue to be an important growth factor over the next decade or more as large homebuilders realize the benefits of size  such as capital strength  more efficient operations and technological advantages 
currently  we have homebuilding operations in of the largest housing markets in the united states 
we have largely completed our geographic diversification plan and are now focused primarily on further penetration in our existing markets 
financial services operating results over the last two years have been favorably impacted by increases in loan originations reflective of a favorable mortgage interest rate environment and improvements in interest spread 
the favorable rate environment also created substantial refinance activity 
thirty year conventional mortgage fixed interest rates were  and as of march   and respectively 
in addition to the increases in loan originations  the financial services operations have also improved their operating leverage  which has had a positive effect on their operating earnings 
our financial services segment will continue to focus on serving the customers of our home building segment and increasing the percentage of conforming mortgage loans provided to them 
for the year ended march   our conforming mortgage business financed approximately of our home building non cash unit closings 
in addition  the financial services growth model includes plans to increase the number of loan officers originating retail loans and improve their productivity 
our conforming mortgage lending business is a fee based business with low capital requirements 
our financial services segment also includes our sub prime home equity lending operations  which is a portfolio based model that produces more predictable earnings 
our sub prime home equity loans are obtained through our organically grown origination channels using centrally controlled product  pricing and underwriting 
the results of operations of certain of our segments  including our home building and financial services operations  may be adversely affected by increases in interest rates 
any significant increase in mortgage interest rates above currently prevailing low levels could affect the ability or willingness of 
table of contents prospective home buyers to finance home purchases and or curtail mortgage refinance activity 
although we expect that we would be able to make adjustments in our operations to mitigate the effects of any increase in interest rates  there can be no assurances that these efforts would be successful 
our construction services segment operating earnings have decreased over the last two years as a result of challenges in the overall commercial construction industry 
industry conditions have created increased pricing pressure on construction companies  which in turn has reduced our construction services operating margins 
however  revenues have increased over the last two years due to our focus on increasing market share 
the commercial construction environment remains challenged but is showing signs of improvement as evidenced by the increase in backlog 
at march   the backlog was billion  an increase of over the prior year 
strategically  we will continue to focus on our core geographic and selected industry segments to achieve growth in revenues and operating earnings 
in fiscal year  we consummated several transactions the most significant of which were the spin offs to our stockholders of substantially all of our manufactured housing operations on june  and our entire ownership interest in construction products  a former majority owned subsidiary  on january  since the dates of the spin offs  the assets and liabilities of manufactured housing and construction products are no longer included in our consolidated balance sheet  their revenues and earnings are no longer included in our consolidated results of continuing operations  and we no longer operate in the construction products business segment 
manufactured housing and construction products are reported as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements contained in this report

we define a neighborhood as an individual active selling location targeted to a specific buyer segment 
the growth in neighborhoods achieved in fiscal was down slightly from the prior year s growth of 
during the year  we added new neighborhoods and closed out of neighborhoods 
our record fourth quarter sales resulted in some existing neighborhoods being closed out ie  all remaining units sold earlier than anticipated 
in addition  to maximize our pricing opportunities  we delayed the opening of other neighborhoods 
the increase in closings per average neighborhood in fiscal was the result of higher sales rates due to our continued focus on market research  activity based sales management and internet marketing 
sales orders for the year were strong across all of our operating regions and totaled  units  an increase of versus the prior year 
home closing volume also increased  to  homes 
strong residential housing market conditions  combined with our geographic  product and segment diversification strategies  continued to drive higher average selling prices 
for fiscal  average selling prices were up to  average selling prices  excluding california  were up to  and california s average selling price was up to 
table of contents operating margins for our domestic homebuilding operations improved to for the fiscal year from in the prior year 
increased unit volume  average selling price increases and continued focus on lowering direct construction and selling  general and administrative costs resulted in margin improvement throughout the home building segment 
national and regional purchasing programs and local cost reduction and efficiency efforts have helped offset increasing raw material costs experienced throughout the year 
we purchase materials  services and land from numerous sources primarily local vendors  and believe that we can deal effectively with the challenges we may experience relating to the supply or availability of materials  services and land 
the above factors contributed to the improvement in our operating earnings  which is reflective of our continued focus on our quality growth strategy  consisting of growing revenue and earnings while expanding margins 
during the year  we continued to increase our land position to facilitate our short and longer term growth initiatives 
based on our current closing projections  our land position that is currently owned or controlled under option agreements at march  would produce approximately of our projected closings for fiscal year  of our projected closings for fiscal year  and of our projected closings for fiscal year international in february  we acquired through merger transactions the partnership  an investment previously accounted for on the equity method of accounting

table of contents our business strategy of selling conforming loans reduces our capital investment and related risks  provides substantial liquidity and is an efficient process given the size and maturity of the conforming mortgage loan secondary capital markets 
ctx mortgage company  llc originates mortgage loans  holds them for a short period and sells them to hsf i and investors 
hsf i is a variable interest entity for which we are the primary beneficiary and  as of july   is consolidated with our financial services segment 
as a result of the consolidation of hsf i  we recorded a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of million  net of tax  in the quarter ended september  this cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle primarily represented the deferral of service release premium income  offset to a lesser extent by the deferral of certain loan origination costs  which was recognized as loans were sold into the secondary market 
the consolidation of hsf i resulted in an increase in our residential mortgage loans held for sale with a corresponding increase in our debt of approximately billion at march  in addition  interest income and interest expense of hsf i subsequent to june  are reflected in our financial statements

ctx mortgage company  llc uses hsf i and short term mortgage warehouse facilities to finance these inventories of loans 
the significant increase in interest margin is due to the consolidation of hsf i interest income and expense in our financial statements subsequent to june  the increase in revenues for the year ended march  is the result of an increase in the volume of loans originated and sold to the secondary market  and to a lesser extent  higher revenues from title and insurance operations

any significant increase in mortgage interest rates above currently prevailing low levels could affect the ability or willingness of prospective home buyers to finance home purchases and or curtail mortgage refinance activity

sub prime home equity lending the following summarizes the results of our sub prime home equity lending operations for the two year period ended march  dollars in millions for the years ended march  change change revenues cost of sales selling  general and administrative expenses operating expenses loan loss provision operating earnings interest margin average interest earning assets average yield nm nm average interest bearing liabilities average rate paid nm nm the revenues of centex home equity company  llc  or home equity  are derived primarily from interest income on mortgage loans held for investment 
home equity s operating earnings are derived primarily from the net interest margin on mortgage loans held for investment 
the majority of home equity s loan originations are securitized and accounted for as borrowings  interest is recorded over the life of the loans using the interest  or actuarial method  the mortgage loans receivable and the securitization debt remain on home equity s balance sheet and the related interest margin is reflected in our income statement 
we commonly refer to these securitized mortgage loans as portfolio accounting method loans 
this structure of securitizations has been utilized since april  previous loans originated were included in securitizations that utilized a structure that caused them to be accounted for as sales 
under this structure  home equity retained a residual interest in  as well as the servicing rights to  the securitized loans 
we call this retained residual interest the mortgage securitization residual interest  or msri 
our balance sheet does not reflect the mortgage loans receivable and offsetting debt resulting from these securitizations  which were accounted for as sales 
the estimated gain on the sale of these loans was included in earnings during the period in which the securitization transaction closed 
under both structures  recourse on the securitized debt is limited to the payments received on the underlying mortgage collateral with no recourse to home equity or centex corporation 
as is common in these structures  home equity remains liable for customary loan representations 
the change in structure of 
table of contents the securitizations has no effect on the ultimate cash flow and profit recognized over the life of the mortgages 
however  the change in accounting for securitizations did affect the timing of profit recognition 
interest margin  which is recognized over the life of the loan  is now home equity s primary source of operating income as compared to gain on sale of loans  which previously was recognized upon securitization 
home equity loans are securitized to provide a low cost method for funding our mortgage operations and to reduce our interest rate exposure on fixed rate loans 
in addition to home equity s mortgage loans held for investment  in fiscal year  home equity sold of its mortgage loans originated to a government sponsored enterprise  which were accounted for as sales 
the revenues of home equity increased for the year ended march  as a result of continued growth in our portfolio of residential mortgage loans held for investment 
interest margin  which we define as the difference between interest revenue on mortgage loans held for sale or investment and interest expense on debt used to fund the mortgage loans  increased primarily as a result of an increase in the portfolio of mortgage loans held for investment and a decrease in interest rates on debt used to fund mortgage loans 
average interest earning assets and liabilities increased primarily due to an increase in the volume of loan originations and an increase in average loan size see table below 
the fact that the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities decreased significantly more than the decrease of the yield earned on interest earning assets  coupled with the increase in originations resulted in the increase in net interest margin

table of contents the increase in origination volume was due to an increase in the average loan size and an increase in the overall sales force  which resulted in an increase in the number of loan applications received 
the increase in home equity s operating earnings is primarily the result of the increase in interest margin  as noted above 
interest income will be positively affected as the portfolio of mortgage loans held for investment increases and matures 
the increase in interest margin was partially offset by an increase in servicing and production costs  mostly attributable to loan volume and loan servicing growth  and an increase in the provision for losses on residential mortgage loans held for investment 
home equity s selling  general and administrative expenses increased as a result of home equity s growth 
home equity s increase in loan production volume  the expansion of its branch offices and the increase in the number of its employees are directly related to a corresponding increase in salaries and related costs  rent expense  group insurance costs and advertising expenditures 
the remainder of the increase was due to an increase in the provision for loan losses 
the increase in the provision for losses in fiscal occurred primarily because the amount of the residential mortgage loans held for investment increased and the residential mortgage loan portfolio continued to mature 
as the age and size of the residential mortgage loan portfolio continues to mature and grow  we expect the provision for losses  the loans charged off and the allowance ratios to continue to increase 
for a more detailed discussion of our accounting policy and methodology for establishing the provision for losses  see critical accounting estimates valuation of residential mortgage loans held for investment on page of this report 
changes in the allowance for losses is included in note c  allowance for losses on residential mortgage loans held for investment  of the notes to consolidated financial statements on page of this report 
the primary risks in home equity s operations are consistent with those of the financial services industry and include credit risk associated with its loans  liquidity risk related to funding its loans and interest rate risk prior to securitization of the loans 
in addition  it is also subject to prepayment risks principal reductions in excess of contractually scheduled reductions associated with loans securitized prior to april see note a  significant accounting policies  of the notes to consolidated financial statements on pages of this report 
construction services the following summarizes construction services results for the two year period ended march  dollars in millions for the years ended march  change change revenues operating earnings new contracts executed backlog of uncompleted contracts operating earnings for construction services decreased as a result of depressed market conditions and the resulting pricing pressure 
in addition  in fiscal  construction services recorded a project loss of million related to the construction of a distribution facility and incurred approximately million of costs associated with its decision to exit the pharmaceutical and industrial construction markets 
the increases in new contracts executed and backlog of uncompleted contracts were the result of our strategy to increase market 
table of contents share by focusing on key geographic markets and certain industry markets 
construction services defines backlog as the uncompleted portion of all signed contracts 
construction services has also been awarded work that is pending execution of a signed contract 
at march  and  such work  which is not included in backlog  was approximately billion and billion  respectively 
there is no assurance that this awarded work will result in future revenues 
investment real estate the following summarizes investment real estate s results for the two year period ended march  dollars in millions for the years ended march  change change revenues earnings from unconsolidated entities operating earnings the changes in revenues and operating earnings were primarily related to the timing of property sales 
property sales contributed operating earnings of million for the year ended march  and million for the same period last year 
the timing of sales is uncertain and can vary significantly from period to period 
it is not currently anticipated that any significant capital will be allocated to investment real estate for new business development 
effective april   investment real estate will be included in the other segment 
other our other segment includes our home services operations  corporate general and administrative expense and interest expense 
in june  we spun off substantially all of our investment in manufactured housing operations  which had previously been included in the other segment 
as a result of the spin off  manufactured housing operations are reflected as a discontinued operation and not included in the segment information below 
other consisted of the following dollars in millions for the years ended march  change change operating loss from home services corporate general and administrative expenses interest expense other operating loss the decrease in our home services division s operating loss in fiscal is primarily due to an million provision recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal to reduce the carrying value of its remaining home security monitoring assets to estimated fair value 
our home services operations sold substantially all of its remaining security monitoring assets in fiscal the sale of these operations did not have a material effect on home services operating loss in fiscal 
table of contents corporate general and administrative expenses represent corporate employee compensation and other corporate costs such as investor communications  insurance  rent and professional services 
the increase in corporate general and administrative expenses is primarily related to compensation increases reflective of additional personnel to support the growth in our operations and higher performance related compensation levels due to the expensing of stock options and increases in our earnings and returns 
in addition  in fiscal  we recorded an incremental million in employee compensation related to acceleration of certain executive compensation costs for the march  retirement of an executive officer 
total interest costs  including interest expensed and relieved to home building s costs and expenses and excluding interest to financial services  for the years ended march  and  were million and million  respectively 
the increase in total interest costs is primarily related to an increase in average debt outstanding for the fiscal year  as compared to the prior year 
this increase is offset by slightly lower borrowing costs in the fiscal year  as compared to the prior year 
for additional discussion of interest costs  see note a  significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements on pages of this report 
our effective tax rate related to continuing operations increased to from in the prior year primarily due to the decrease in the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards during fiscal compared to fiscal we expect that the effective tax rate will increase in fiscal to approximately 
the expected increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to the reduction of net operating loss carryforwards available to offset future taxable income 
discontinued operations in june  we spun off to our stockholders substantially all of our manufactured housing operations  and in january  we spun off to our stockholders our entire equity interest in construction products 
as a result of the spin offs  the earnings from these operations have been reclassified to discontinued operations in the statements of consolidated earnings 
all prior period information related to these discontinued operations has been reclassified to be consistent with the march  presentation 
for the years ended march  and  discontinued operations had revenues of million and million and operating earnings of million and million  respectively 
in connection with the tax free distribution of our interests in construction products  we recognized  as a component of discontinued operations  a tax benefit of million 
the tax benefit is a result of the reversal of a deferred tax liability for the difference between the financial carrying amount of our investment in construction products and the respective tax basis  which was no longer required given the tax free nature of the distribution 
in connection with the spin offs  we recorded a dividend to stockholders of million representing our net investments in manufactured housing operations and construction products on the respective spin off dates

table of contents construction services the following summarizes construction services results for the two year period ended march  dollars in millions for the years ended march  change change revenues operating earnings new contracts executed backlog of uncompleted contracts the increase in revenues was primarily the result of a shift in the stage of completion of certain longer term construction contracts 
additionally  in fiscal  we had a greater volume of shorter term construction contracts as compared to the prior year 
operating earnings for the group decreased primarily as a result of a decrease in project margins reflective of the current construction environment 
in addition  in fiscal  construction services recorded a project profit write down of million related to a single project and a million write down of a long lived asset 
the decreases in new contracts executed and backlog of uncompleted contracts were the result of reduced activity in the commercial construction industry and delays in the execution of contracts for awarded projects 
future operating margins and earnings are likely to be impacted by this reduced activity and our lower backlog 
investment real estate the following summarizes investment real estate s results for the two year period ended march  dollars in millions for the years ended march  change change revenues earnings from unconsolidated entities operating earnings the changes in revenues and operating earnings were primarily related to the timing of property sales 
property sales contributed operating earnings of million for the year ended march  and million for the same period last year 
the timing of sales is uncertain and can vary significantly from period to period 

table of contents other our other segment includes corporate general and administrative expense and interest expense 
also included in our other segment are our home services operations  which are not material for purposes of segment reporting 
for the years ended march  change change operating loss earnings from home services corporate general and administrative expenses interest expense other operating loss the decrease in our home services division s operating earnings in fiscal is primarily due to higher general and administrative expenses  including higher marketing costs  and an million provision in the fourth quarter to reduce the carrying value of its remaining home security assets to estimated fair value 
our home services operations sold its chemical lawn care business in the second quarter 
the sale of this business did not have a material effect on home services operating earnings 
corporate general and administrative expense represents compensation and other costs not identifiable with a specific segment 
the increase in corporate general and administrative expense is primarily related to an increase in personnel and higher compensation resulting from continued improvements in our performance 
our effective tax rate decreased to for the year ended march  from for the year ended march  the decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily the result of the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards during fiscal discontinued operations in june  we spun off to our stockholders substantially all of our manufactured housing operations  and in january  we spun off to our stockholders our entire equity interest in construction products 
as a result of the spin offs  the earnings of these operations have been reclassified to discontinued operations in the statements of consolidated earnings 
all prior period information related to these discontinued operations has been reclassified to be consistent with the march  presentation 
for the years ended march  and  discontinued operations had revenues of million and million and operating earnings of million and million  respectively 

table of contents financial condition and liquidity the consolidating net cash used in or provided by the operating  investing and financing activities for the years march   and is summarized below dollars in thousands

for the years ended march  net cash used in provided by centex operating activities investing activities financing activities effect of exchange rate on cash financial services operating activities investing activities financing activities centex corporation and subsidiaries operating activities investing activities financing activities effect of exchange rate on cash net increase decrease in cash centex represents a supplemental presentation that reflects the financial services segment as if accounted for under the equity method 
we believe that separate disclosure of the consolidating information is useful because the financial services subsidiaries operate in a distinctly different financial environment that generally requires significantly less equity to support their higher debt levels compared to the operations of our other subsidiaries  the financial services subsidiaries have structured their financing programs substantially on a stand alone basis  and centex has limited obligations with respect to the indebtedness of our financial services subsidiaries 
management uses this information in its financial and strategic planning 
we also use this presentation to allow investors to compare us to homebuilders that do not have financial services operations 
we generally fund our centex operating and other short term liquidity needs through cash provided by operations  borrowings from commercial paper and other short term credit arrangements and the issuance of medium term notes and other debt securities 
centex s operating cash is derived primarily through home and land sales from our home building segment and general contracting fees obtained through our construction services segment 
during fiscal  cash was primarily used in centex s operating activities to finance increases in home building inventories relating to the increased level of sales and resulting units under construction during the year  and for the acquisition of land held for development 
the funds provided by centex s financing activities were primarily from debt issued to fund the increased homebuilding activity 
we generally fund our financial services operating and other short term liquidity needs through securitizations  committed credit facilities  proceeds from the sale of mortgage loans to investors and cash flows from operations 
financial services operating cash is derived primarily through sales of mortgage loans  interest income on mortgage loans held for investment and origination and servicing fees

as these mortgage loans have been sold in the secondary market  an inflow of cash from operating activities has occurred 
during fiscal  cash was primarily used in financial services investing activities to finance increases in residential mortgage loans held for investment 
for additional discussion on the consolidation of hsf i in june  see note f  indebtedness  of the notes to consolidated financial statements on pages of this report 
the funds provided by financial services financing activities were primarily from new debt used to fund the increased residential mortgage loan activity

the basis of the rate is us libor which was at march  as outlined above  our primary contractual obligations are payments under long term debt agreements and lease payments under operating leases 
purchase obligations primarily represent specific performance agreements of our home building segment that in essence may require us to purchase the land contingent upon the land seller meeting certain obligations  joint funding obligations and open purchase orders 
financial services long term debt associated with home equity includes asset backed certificates related to securitized residential mortgage loans structured as collateralized borrowings 
the principal and interest on these certificates are paid from the liquidation of the underlying residential mortgage loans  which serve as collateral for the debt 
accordingly  the timing of the principal payments on these certificates is dependent upon the payments received on the underlying residential mortgage loans 
the contractual obligations of this component of long term debt are based on contractual maturities adjusted for projected prepayments 
our contractual obligations will be funded in the ordinary course of business through our operating cash flows and through our credit facilities 
centex corporation currently has an investment grade credit rating from each of the principal credit rating agencies 
our ability to finance our activities on favorable terms is dependent to a significant extent on whether we are able to maintain our investment grade credit ratings 
we attempt to manage our debt levels in order to maintain investment grade ratings 
if  however  our debt ratings were downgraded  we would not have access to the commercial paper markets and might need to draw on our existing committed backup facility  which exceeds our commercial paper program size

table of contents certain off balance sheet obligations the following is a summary of certain off balance sheet arrangements and other obligations and their possible effects on our liquidity and capital resources 
joint ventures we conduct a portion of our land acquisition  development and other activities through our participation in joint ventures in which we hold less than a majority interest 
these land related activities typically require substantial capital  and partnering with other developers allows centex homes to share the risks and rewards of ownership while providing for efficient asset utilization 
our investment in these non consolidated joint ventures  accounted for using the equity method  was million and million at march  and  respectively 
these joint ventures had total outstanding secured debt of approximately million and million at march  and  respectively 
our liability with respect to this debt  based on our ownership percentage of the related joint ventures  is limited to approximately million and million at march  and  respectively 
under the structure of this debt  we become liable up to these amounts only to the extent that the construction debt exceeds a certain percentage of the value of the project 
at march  and  we were not liable for any of this debt 
for a discussion of the impact of new accounting pronouncements on our accounting for transactions with non consolidated joint ventures  see recent accounting pronouncements on pages of this report 
critical accounting estimates some of our critical accounting policies require the use of judgment in their application or require estimates of inherently uncertain matters 
our accounting policies are in compliance with generally accepted accounting principles  however  a change in the facts and circumstances of the underlying transactions could significantly change the application of the accounting policies and the resulting financial statement impact 
listed below are those policies that we believe are critical and require the use of complex judgment in their application 
impairment of long lived assets housing projects and land held for development and sale are stated at the lower of cost including direct construction costs  capitalized interest and real estate taxes or fair value less cost to sell 
property and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation 
we assess these assets for recoverability in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  or sfas no 
sfas no 
requires that long lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
these evaluations for impairment are significantly impacted by estimates of revenues  costs and expenses and other factors 
if these assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
no significant impairments of long lived assets were recorded in fiscal  or 
table of contents goodwill goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over net assets of businesses acquired 
see note e  goodwill  of the notes to consolidated financial statements on pages of this report for a summary of the changes in goodwill by segment 
we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  or sfas no 
 effective april  upon the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill is no longer subject to amortization 
rather  goodwill will be subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment  at the reporting unit level  by applying a fair value based test 
if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value  an impairment has occurred 
we continually evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining balance of goodwill may not be recoverable 
fair value is estimated using a discounted cash flow or market valuation approach 
such evaluations for impairment are significantly impacted by estimates of future revenues  costs and expenses and other factors 
if the goodwill is considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds the fair value of the future cash flows 
we had no impairment of goodwill in fiscal  and land held under option agreements not owned in order to ensure the future availability of land for homebuilding  the company enters into lot option purchase agreements with unaffiliated third parties 
under the option agreements  the company pays a stated deposit in consideration for the right to purchase land at a future time  usually at predetermined prices 
these options generally do not contain performance requirements from the company nor obligate the company to purchase the land 
the company has evaluated those entities with which we entered into lot option agreements in accordance with the provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  as revised fin 
the provisions of fin require the company to consolidate the financial results of a variable interest entity if the company is the primary beneficiary of the variable interest entity 
variable interest entities are entities in which equity investors do not have a controlling financial interest and or the entity is unable to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity is the owner or investor that absorbs a majority of the variable interest entity s expected losses and or receives a majority of the variable interest entity s expected residual returns 
the company determines if it is the primary beneficiary of variable interest entities based upon analysis of the variability of the expected gains and losses of the variable interest entity 
expected gains and losses of the variable interest entity are highly dependent upon management s estimates of the variability and probabilities of future land prices  the probabilities of expected cash flows and entitlement risks related to the underlying land  among other factors 
based on this evaluation  if the company is the primary beneficiary of those entities with which we have entered into lot option agreements  the variable interest entity is consolidated 
for purposes of consolidation  to the extent financial statements are available  the company consolidates the assets and liabilities of the variable interest entity 
if financial statements for the variable interest entity are not available  the company records the remaining purchase price of land in the consolidated balance sheets under the caption  land held under option agreements not owned  with a corresponding increase in minority interests 
lot option deposits related to these options are reclassified to land held under option agreements not owned 
see note i  land held under option agreement not owned and other land deposits  of the notes to consolidated financial statements on page of this report for further discussion on the results of our analysis of lot option agreements 

table of contents valuation of residential mortgage loans held for investment home equity originates and purchases loans in accordance with standard underwriting criteria 
the underwriting standards are primarily intended to assess the creditworthiness of the mortgagee  the value of the mortgaged property and the adequacy of the property as collateral for the home equity loan 
home equity establishes an allowance for losses by recording a provision for losses in the statement of consolidated earnings when it believes a loss has occurred 
when home equity determines that a residential mortgage loan held for investment is partially or fully uncollectible  the estimated loss is charged against the allowance for losses 
recoveries on losses previously charged to the allowance are credited to the allowance at the time the recovery is collected 
we believe that the allowance for losses is sufficient to provide for credit losses in the existing residential mortgage loans held for investment  which include real estate owned 
we evaluate the allowance on an aggregate basis considering  among other things  the relationship of the allowance to residential mortgage loans held for investment and historical credit losses 
the allowance reflects our judgment of the present loss exposure at the end of the reporting period 
a range of expected credit losses is estimated using historical losses  static pool loss curves and delinquency modeling 
these tools take into consideration historical information regarding delinquency and loss severity experience and apply that information to the portfolio at each reporting date 
although we consider the allowance for losses on residential mortgage loans held for investment reflected in our consolidated balance sheet to be adequate  there can be no assurance that this allowance will prove to be sufficient over time to cover ultimate losses 
this allowance may prove to be insufficient due to unanticipated adverse changes in the economy or discrete events adversely affecting specific customers or industries 
see note c  allowance for losses on residential mortgage loans held for investment  of the notes to consolidated financial statements on page of this report for a discussion of the changes in the allowance for losses 
mortgage securitization residual interest home equity uses mortgage securitizations to finance its mortgage loan portfolio 
for securitizations prior to april  which home equity accounted for as sales  home equity retained a mortgage securitization residual interest  or msri 
the msri represents the present value of home equity s right to receive  over the life of the securitization  the excess of the weighted average coupon on the loans securitized over the interest rates on the securities sold  a normal servicing fee  a trustee fee and an insurance fee  where applicable  net of the credit losses relating to the loans securitized 
home equity estimates the fair value of msri through the application of discounted cash flow analysis 
such analysis requires the use of various assumptions  the most significant of which are anticipated prepayments principal reductions in excess of contractually scheduled reductions  estimated future credit losses and the discount rate applied to future cash flows 
see note a  significant accounting policies  of the notes to consolidated financial statements on pages of this report for a discussion of the sensitivity of the msri to changes in the assumptions 
loan origination reserve ctx mortgage company  llc has established a liability for anticipated losses associated with loans originated 
this liability includes losses associated with certain borrower payment defaults  credit quality issues or misrepresentation 
ctx mortgage company  llc estimates the losses that may be incurred for certain loan originations based on  among other factors  historical loss rates and current trends in loan originations 
this liability reflects management s judgment of the loss exposure at the end of the reporting period 

table of contents although we consider the loan origination reserve reflected in our consolidated balance sheet at march  to be adequate  there can be no assurance that this reserve will prove to be sufficient over time to cover ultimate losses in connection with our loan originations 
this reserve may prove to be insufficient due to unanticipated adverse changes in the economy or discrete events adversely affecting specific customers 
warranty accruals home building offers a ten year limited warranty for most homes constructed and sold in the united states and in the united kingdom 
the united states warranties cover defects in materials or workmanship in the first year of the home and certain designated components or structural elements of the home in the second through tenth years 
the united kingdom warranties cover defects in materials or workmanship in various components of the home for the first two years and designated structural elements of the home in the third through tenth years 
in california  effective january   centex homes began following the statutory provisions of senate bill  which in part provides a statutory warranty to customers and a statutory dispute resolution process 
home building estimates the costs that may be incurred under its warranty program for which it will be responsible and records a liability at the time each home is closed 
factors that affect home building s warranty liability include the number of homes closed  historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims and cost per claim 
home building periodically assesses the adequacy of its recorded warranty liability and adjusts the amounts as necessary 
although we consider the warranty accruals reflected in our consolidated balance sheet to be adequate  there can be no assurance that this accrual will prove to be sufficient over time to cover ultimate losses 
effective april   home building s united states warranties covering defects in materials or workmanship were extended to two years 
insurance accruals we have certain deductible limits under our workers compensation  automobile and general liability insurance policies for which reserves are actuarially determined based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported 
projection of losses concerning these liabilities is subject to a high degree of variability due to factors such as claim settlement patterns  litigation trends and legal interpretations  among others 
although we consider the insurance accruals reflected in our consolidated balance sheet to be adequate  there can be no assurance that this accrual will prove to be sufficient over time to cover ultimate losses

these statements are not historical facts or guarantees of future performance but instead represent only our belief at the time the statements were made regarding future events  which are subject to significant risks  uncertainties  and other factors  many of which are outside of the company s control 
actual results and outcomes may differ materially from what we express or forecast in these forward looking statements 
all forward looking statements made in this report are made as of the date hereof  and the risk that actual results will differ materially from expectations expressed in this report will increase with the passage of time 
we undertake no duty to update any forward looking statement to reflect future events or changes in our expectations 

table of contents in addition to the specific risks and uncertainties discussed elsewhere in this report  the following risks and uncertainties may affect our business  operations  financial condition or results of operations our home building operations are sensitive to changes in general economic conditions  including levels of employment  consumer confidence and income  availability of financing  interest rate levels and changes in the economic condition of the local markets in which we operate 
our home building operations depend to a significant extent upon our being able to acquire land that is suitable for residential development at acceptable prices and in locations that are desirable to us 
any increases in the cost or reductions in the supply of suitable land for development could affect the revenues or operating earnings of our home building operations 
our home building operations may be adversely affected by increases in interest rates 
the majority of our home buyers finance their purchases of homes 
in general  housing demand is likely to be adversely affected by significant increases in interest rates 
if mortgage interest rates increase significantly and the ability or willingness of prospective buyers to finance home purchases is adversely affected  our operating results may be adversely affected 
our home building and construction services operations could be adversely affected by fluctuating lumber prices and supply  as well as shortages of other materials  including insulation  drywall  concrete  carpenters  electricians and plumbers 
in addition  both our home building and construction services operations are subject to risks and uncertainties involving the cost and availability of labor and labor disputes 
these factors could cause delays in construction that could have an adverse effect upon our home building and construction services operations 
our international homebuilding operations are affected by fluctuations in the value of the united states dollar as compared to the british pound sterling and changes in the british economy to the extent those changes affect the homebuilding market in the united kingdom 
we do not currently use any hedging instruments or other strategies to manage currency risks related to fluctuations in the value of the united states dollar or the british pound sterling 
our home building operations are also subject to other risks and uncertainties  including seasonal variations  adverse weather conditions  the general demand for housing in national and regional markets and new construction and the resale market for existing homes 
although national demand for commercial construction is relatively stable  individual markets do experience moderate cyclicality and can be sensitive to overall capital spending trends in the economy  changes in federal and state appropriations for construction projects  financing and capital availability for commercial real estate and competitive pressures on the availability and pricing of construction projects 
our construction services operations are also subject to other risks and uncertainties  including the timing of new awards and the funding of such awards  adverse weather conditions  cancellations of  or changes in the scope to  existing contracts  the ability to meet performance or schedule guarantees and cost overruns 
an increase in interest rates could have an adverse affect on our financial services operations 
the operations of ctx mortgage company  llc are influenced by borrowers perceptions of and reactions to interest rates 
any significant increase in mortgage rates above currently prevailing levels could adversely affect the volume of loan originations due to curtailment of refinancing activity 
our home equity operations involve holding residential mortgage loans for investment and establishing an allowance for credit losses on these loans 
although the amount of this allowance reflects our judgment as 
table of contents to our present loss exposure on these loans  there can be no assurance that it will be sufficient to cover any losses that may ultimately be incurred 
all of our businesses operate in very competitive environments  which are characterized by competition from a number of other homebuilders  mortgage lenders  and contractors in each of the markets in which we operate 
any increase in competition has the potential to reduce the number of homes we sell  or to compel us to accept reduced profit margins in order to maintain sales volume 
we are subject to various federal  state and local statutes  rules and regulations that could affect our businesses  including those concerning zoning  construction  protecting the environment and health 
in addition  our businesses could be affected by changes in federal income tax policy  federal mortgage loan financing programs and other changes in regulation or policy 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on our direct debt obligations  mortgage loans receivable and residual interest in mortgage securitizations 
the following analysis provides a framework to understand our sensitivity to hypothetical changes in interest rates as of march  we have utilized derivative instruments in conjunction with our overall strategy to manage the amount of debt outstanding that is subject to changes in interest rates 
as of march   we had interest rate swap agreements that converted billion of our variable rate debt outstanding into fixed rate debt 
we recognize amounts paid or received under interest rate swap agreements as adjustments to interest expense 
financial services originates  sells and securitizes conforming and nonconforming a mortgages  sub prime first and second mortgages and home equity loans 
since december  substantially all conforming and jumbo a mortgages have been sold to hsf i at or near the date on which the loans were funded 
hsf i has entered into a swap arrangement with a bank the harwood swap under which the bank has agreed to make certain payments to hsf i  and hsf i has agreed to make certain payments to the bank  the net effect of which is that the bank has agreed to bear certain interest rate risks  non credit related market risks and prepayment risks related to the mortgage loans held by hsf i 
however  the company effectively bears all interest rate risks  non credit related market risks and prepayment risks related to the harwood swap because centex has entered into a separate swap arrangement with the bank pursuant to which centex has agreed to pay to the bank all amounts that the bank is required to pay to hsf i pursuant to the harwood swap plus a monthly fee equal to a percentage of the notional amount of the harwood swap 
additionally  the bank is required to pay to centex all amounts that the bank receives from hsf i pursuant to the harwood swap 
financial services executes the forward sales of ctx mortgage company  llc s loans to hedge the risk of reductions in value of mortgages sold to hsf i or maintained under secured financing agreements 
this offsets the majority of our risk as the counterparty to the swap supporting the payment requirements of hsf i 
ctx mortgage company  llc  acting as manager of hsf i  delivers mortgages held by hsf i to third party purchasers generally within days of origination 
due to the high degree of liquidity in the a mortgage market and the frequency of loan sales and securitizations  the use of forward sales is an effective hedge against changes in market value that result from changes in interest rates 
home equity uses interest rate swaps to hedge the market risk associated with the carrying of mortgages in anticipation of issuance of securitization debt to finance sub prime mortgages 
home equity will generally hold mortgages in anticipation of securitization for up to days 
home equity also uses interest rate swaps  included in the billion balance stated above that  in effect  fix the interest rate on its variable interest rate debt 

table of contents as of march   our total msri was million  comprised of million related to home equity and million related to ctx mortgage company  llc 
home equity s msri consists of million remaining on loans securitized from october to march accounted for as gain on sale and million related to loans sold in fiscal year to a government sponsored enterprise that we continue to service 
ctx mortgage company  llc s msri resulted from an acquisition in fiscal we continually monitor the fair value of the msri and review the factors expected to influence the future constant prepayment rate  or cpr  discount rates and credit losses 
in developing assumptions regarding expected future cpr  we consider a variety of factors  many of which are interrelated 
these factors include historical performance  origination channels  characteristics of borrowers  such as credit quality and loan to value relationships  and market factors that influence competition 
if changes in assumptions regarding future cpr  discount rates or credit losses are necessary  the msri fair value is adjusted accordingly 
our international homebuilding operations are located in the united kingdom 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in the foreign currency exchange rate or weak economic conditions in our markets 
our aggregate net investment exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk is approximately million as of march  we utilize both short term and long term debt in our financing strategy 
for fixed rate debt  changes in interest rates generally affect the fair market value of the debt instrument but not our earnings or cash flows 
conversely  for variable rate debt  changes in interest rates generally do not impact the fair market value of the debt instrument but do affect our future earnings and cash flows 
we do not have an obligation to prepay any of our fixed rate debt prior to maturity  and as a result  interest rate risk and changes in fair market value should not have a significant impact on the fixed rate debt until we are required to refinance such debt 
as of march   short term debt was billion  all of which was applicable to financial services 
the majority of financial services debt is collateralized by residential mortgage loans 
we borrow on a short term basis in the commercial paper market under a million commercial paper program supported by an million revolving credit facility with a term expiring in fiscal year and from banks under uncommitted lines  all of which bear interest at prevailing market rates 
the weighted average interest rate on short term borrowings outstanding at march  was 
the maturities of centex s long term debt outstanding at march  were as follows 
we define centex as a supplemental presentation that reflects the financial services segment as if accounted for under the equity method

the following table sets forth the estimated maturity or repricing of our financial services obligations collateralized by securitized residential mortgage loans accounted for as borrowings outstanding at march  maturities through march  thereafter total fair value in s financial services fixed rate debt average interest rate variable rate debt average interest rate the following table sets forth the estimated maturity or repricing of our financial services obligations collateralized by securitized residual mortgage loans accounted for as borrowings outstanding at march  maturities through march  thereafter total fair value in s financial services fixed rate debt average interest rate variable rate debt average interest rate the principal and interest on this debt is paid using the cash flows from the underlying mortgage receivables  which serve as collateral for this debt 
accordingly  the timing of the principal payments on this debt is dependent on the payments received on the underlying mortgage receivables 
the amounts shown within a particular period were determined in accordance with the contractual terms of the debt  except fixed rate mortgage securities reflect estimated prepayments  which were estimated based on the results of a prepayment model we utilize  and empirical data  and adjustable rate debt is included in the period in which it is first scheduled to adjust and not in the period in which it matures 
we believe that these assumptions approximate actual experience and consider them reasonable 
however  the interest rate sensitivity could vary substantially if different assumptions were used or actual experience differs from the historical experience on which we base the assumptions
