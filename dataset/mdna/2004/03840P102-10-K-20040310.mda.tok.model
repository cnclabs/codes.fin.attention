item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations strategic and financial repositioning there have been significant changes in the energy industry during the three years ended december  these changes were primarily a result of lower prices in the power markets as new generation capacity continued to come online  the stabilization of commodity prices in california  the bankruptcy and near bankruptcy of several energy merchants  the tightening of the credit markets for energy merchant companies in particular  and the lack of liquidity in forward energy markets as companies continued to exit and or scale back their energy trading activities 
in response to this escalating set of circumstances  we exited from our wholesale energy trading business and divested the majority of our related activities and assets during we continued to unwind and restructure our remaining merchant contracts and sell non core assets in separately  we restructured domestic networks in to more closely align it with its regulatory service areas 
staff reductions due to our ongoing restructuring efforts  including employees transferred with the sale of various businesses  consisted of approximately  merchant services employees  corporate employees and domestic networks employees in with our exit from wholesale trading  we began to transition to a business comprised primarily of our domestic regulated utility business and our merchant power plants 
we consider our domestic utility assets our core business 
as part of this transition  we took the following actions in began the wind down of our merchant services trading portfolio in north america and europe  sold our natural gas storage facilities in both north america and the united kingdom  sold our merchant loan portfolio  sold our gas gathering and processing business located primarily in texas and oklahoma  reduced our investment in quanta services  inc a company specializing in building and maintaining networks used to carry energy and telecommunications from to  and sold our equity investment in our regulated utility operations in new zealand 
in  we continued to execute on our transition plan through the following actions sold our remaining investment quanta services  inc  sold our australian investments  executed a definitive agreement to sell our united kingdom investment  which we completed in january  entered into a three year senior secured term loan facility  terminated our capacity payment obligations under our acadia tolling agreement  signed definitive agreements to sell our canadian utility businesses  signed definitive agreements to sell our investments in independent power plants  which we expect to close in the first quarter of  pursued a appropriate rate increases for certain of our gas and electric operations  and b regulatory approvals to pledge our network assets as collateral for the working capital requirements of our utility operations  and continued the wind down of our wholesale energy trading businesses in north america and europe 
proceeds from these asset sales were used to pay down debt  fund restructuring charges and support our continuing operations 
we now plan to operate primarily as a regulated utility with various investments in non regulated power generation facilities 
as we continue our transition in  we intend to focus on the following areas the improvement of our domestic utility operations  primarily by a eliminating cost and operational inefficiencies  b improving customer service  c continuing to pursue appropriate rate relief  and d improving our relationships with the state public service commissions  the reduction of liabilities  which includes attempting to restructure significant contractual liabilities  such as our long term gas contracts and capacity tolling agreements and pursuing arrangements that will result in the return of collateral posted under contracts with counterparties  and improving our capital structure by continuing to sell assets and issuing equity or convertible debt securities as market conditions warrant 
liquidity and capital resources overall because of our non investment grade credit rating and limitations on our ability to raise incremental capital through the bank and capital markets  for short term liquidity needs  we must rely primarily on our existing cash position combined with anticipated proceeds from pending asset sales 
the following table reflects our anticipated cash sources and key short term contractual obligations for including short term debt reported in discontinued operations in millions anticipated cash sources cash at december  pending asset sale proceeds midlands independent power plants canadian utility operations a total  anticipated debt and long term gas contract requirements short term debt bank borrowings canada current maturities of long term debt senior notes due on july and october  canadian asset securitization b miscellaneous subtotal long term gas contract commitments total a gross proceeds net of assumed debt obligations 
b this facility is secured by certain future rate collections and will be paid off in march we plan to address our short term obligations with cash on hand and the pending asset sale proceeds listed above 
in the event the asset sales do not occur prior to maturity of our short term obligations  we will need to address the maturity of our senior notes listed above with existing cash and additional borrowings to bridge the timing of the pending asset sale proceeds 
the remaining liquidity  after the pending asset sales close and the short term obligations are satisfied  will be used for future working capital requirements and discretionary liability reductions 
liability reductions would most likely be in the form of reduction of our debt and contractual liabilities  including tolling contracts and long term gas contracts 
in february  we extinguished approximately million  including principal and accrued interest  of a note payable 
we paid million to extinguish this note resulting in other income related to this transaction of approximately million 
we originally issued this note to firstenergy corp 
in connection with our investment in midlands electricity in this note required annual payments of million through may in  firstenergy sold this note to two unrelated third parties 
pending asset sales in september  we agreed to sell our canadian utility businesses to fortis inc for approximately c  million us  million at the december  exchange rate  including the repayment or assumption of c million us million at the december  exchange rate  or us million in net proceeds to us before closing adjustments  transaction costs and taxes 
we estimate that we will pay approximately us million in cash taxes and transaction costs 
in addition  we will be required to repay us million borrowed by our canadian subsidiaries under a day unsecured loan 
the transaction is subject to approval of the regulatory commissions in alberta and british columbia  among other regulatory bodies  as well as other customary closing conditions  and is expected to close in the first half of if the sale does not close by june   the sale agreement will automatically terminate 
we have a currency hedge on the anticipated canadian asset sale proceeds 
see discussion of currency rate exposures under item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in october  we agreed to sell our interest in asl  the owner of midlands electricity plc  to a subsidiary of powergen uk plc  for approximately million  before transaction costs 
we completed the sale in january and received proceeds before transaction costs of million 
in november  we agreed to sell our interest in independent power projects to teton power funding  llc  an affiliate of arclight capital partners  llc 
this sale is expected to close in march and we expect to receive net cash proceeds of approximately million  before transaction costs and taxes 
working capital requirements due to our non investment grade credit rating and lack of short term lines of credit  we must maintain cash on hand at all times to cover the peak working capital requirements of our business 
the most significant activity impacting working capital is the purchase of natural gas for our gas utility customers 
we could experience significant working capital requirements during peak winter heating months due to higher natural gas consumption  potential periods of high natural gas prices and the fact that we are currently required to prepay certain of our gas commodity suppliers and pipeline transportation companies 
we are currently working on solutions to shorten the time lag between our procurement of the commodity and the collection of our revenue 
this could be accomplished through a combination of establishing an accounts receivable sales program  or establishing credit lines with our commodity vendors 
cash flows cash flows from operating activities our cash flows from operations were negative due to significant cash impacts resulting primarily from our non investment grade credit rating and the continued exit from our wholesale energy trading business 
our negative cash flows were driven by the following events and factors during  we had significant working capital requirements due to our non investment grade credit rating and the resulting changes in vendor payment terms 
we were required to post significant collateral in due to our non investment grade credit rating and increased natural gas prices 
some of our collateral from was returned to us as we continued to exit our energy trading businesses 
however  we were required to cash collateralize our letters of credit under our new letter of credit facility 
we made a million payment to terminate our acadia tolling contract in connection with our restructuring effort to return to operating as a domestic utility 
we made other restructuring payments of million in for severance  retention and other related charges due to our continued exit from the wholesale energy trading business  primarily for severance that had been accrued in and due to our restructuring of everest connections 
higher gas prices in resulted in increased cash payments for the purchase of gas inventory for our utilities 
offsetting cash outflows was the receipt of approximately million of income tax refunds received during the year 
cash flows from operations in were also negative 
these cash flows were negative primarily as a result of our significant losses in  our non investment grade credit rating and our actions taken to exit from the wholesale energy trading business 
our negative operating cash flows were driven by the following events and factors we terminated our accounts receivable sales programs in resulting in million in cash outflows as these receivables were collected and paid to the vendor 
however  no additional receivables were sold 
also increasing cash outflows was the payment of higher annual and long term incentive compensation based on earnings 
we were required to post significant collateral as a result of our credit rating downgrades to non investment grade 
these collateral demands were related to trading contracts as well as certain debt and tolling agreements 
we made million of restructuring payments in for severance  retention and other related charges primarily due to our exit from the wholesale energy trading business and for the restructuring of our domestic utilities business to more closely align it with its regulatory service areas 
in addition  we made payments of million to our defined benefit pension plans to offset declines in plan asset values due to market performance 
partially offsetting cash outflows were cash collections related to price risk management assets and inflows due to the liquidation of our wholesale gas storage inventory 
we also have material margin losses related to our long term gas contracts in our operating cash flows 
these margin losses represent the cash payments for gas purchased to settle these contracts on a monthly basis  net of the contract amortization reported in financing activities discussed below 
these obligations and our capacity tolling contracts will have a material negative impact on our operating cash flows for the foreseeable future 
we are attempting to restructure or terminate these obligations 
any cash payments made to exit these obligations will have a negative impact on operating cash flows in the year the payment is made  but are expected to improve operating cash flows in future periods 
our significant debt load relative to our overall capitalization and the interest rate we pay on million of our long term bonds has substantially increased our interest costs and will continue to negatively impact our operating cash flows 
we expect to reduce our overall interest expense in by retiring a portion of our debt through the use of proceeds that will be generated from the sale of our canadian utility businesses and independent power projects 
these interest savings will be partially offset  however  by the loss of cash flows from the businesses that are sold 
it will be important for us to substantially improve our operating cash flows 
we are attempting to do this by improving the efficiency of our remaining businesses  increasing revenues through utility rates  retiring debt and restructuring the obligations discussed above 
cash flows from investing activities cash flows provided from investing activities increased in compared to this increase mainly stemmed from reduced capital expenditures in  primarily in the merchant business  as merchant plant construction was significantly completed in we also made a significant investment in midlands electricity in which did not recur in in addition  we sold our merchant loan portfolio in december this portfolio generated net cash outflows in these decreased cash outflows were partially offset by a decrease in cash received from the sale of assets and subsidiary stock in compared to cash provided from investing activities in increased from this increase primarily stemmed from billion of cash received on the sale of assets and a reduction in merchant capital expenditures 
partially offsetting these cash sources was increased capital expenditures for utility plant additions 
in addition  the acquisition of our interest in midlands electricity in may increased cash used for investing activities 
cash flows from financing activities cash flows from financing activities decreased in compared to our net cash used for financing activities stems from the repayment of short term borrowings and from the reduction of long term debt 
cash flows from financing activities in came primarily from our issuance of common stock and senior notes 
in january  we issued million shares of our common stock to the public  which raised approximately million in net proceeds 
we also sold million of senior notes due in march the issuance of million common shares and million of senior notes in july raised approximately million 
we used the proceeds of these issuances primarily to replace the liquidity formerly provided by our accounts receivables sale programs that were terminated in and to retire debt and company obligated preferred securities 
we also have material cash outflows related to our long term gas contracts in our financing activities 
these cash outflows represent the amortization of our recorded liability based on the units of revenue method of accounting 
the combined operating cash outflow and financing cash outflow related to long term gas contracts represents the total cost to purchase gas to service these contracts 
if we do not terminate or restructure these contracts  we will continue to have similar cash outflows related to these contracts in our financing activities in future periods 
current credit ratings credit ratings impact our ability to obtain short and long term financing  the cost of such financing and vendor payment terms 
our financial flexibility is limited because of restrictive covenants and other terms that are typically imposed on non investment grade borrowers 
as of december   our senior unsecured long term debt ratings  as assessed by the three major credit rating agencies  were as follows agency rating commentary moody s investors service moody s caa negative outlook standard poor s corporation s p b negative outlook fitch ratings fitch b negative outlook we do not have any trigger events eg  an acceleration of repayment of outstanding indebtedness  an increase in interest costs or the posting of cash collateral tied to our stock price and have not executed any transactions that require us to issue equity based on our credit ratings or other trigger events 
collateral positions as of december   we had posted collateral for the following in the form of cash or cash collateralized letters of credit in millions december  trading positions utility cash collateral requirements tolling agreements insurance and other total funds on deposit collateral requirements for our remaining trading positions will fluctuate based on movement in commodity prices 
this will vary depending on the magnitude of the price movement and the current position of our portfolio 
we will receive our posted collateral related to trading positions as we settle our trading positions in the future 
we are required to post collateral to certain of our commodity and pipeline transportation vendors 
this amount will fluctuate depending on gas prices and projected volumetric deliveries 
the ultimate return of this collateral is dependent on our successful strengthening of our credit profile 
we have been required to post collateral related to our elwood tolling contract until we either successfully restructure the contact or obtain investment grade ratings from certain major rating agencies 
we will not be required to post any additional collateral related to this contract 
contractual obligations our contractual cash obligations include maturities of long term debt  cash payments for long term gas contracts  minimum payments on operating leases and regulated power  gas and coal purchase contracts  as well as merchant tolling obligations and gas transportation obligations 
see notes  and to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these obligations 
the amounts of contractual cash obligations maturing in each of the next five years and thereafter are shown below in millions thereafter total long term debt obligations long term gas contracts lease and maintenance obligations merchant tolling obligations merchant gas transportation obligations regulated purchase obligations total  in addition  we have contractual obligations related to our discontinued operations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
long term gas contracts we accounted for the cash payments in advance related to these contracts as liabilities 
we recognize the relief of our obligation for these long term gas contracts as the gas is delivered to the customer under the units of revenue method 
if we were to default on these obligations  or were unable to perform on them  we would be required to pay the issuers of the surety bonds or the counterparties on these arrangements approximately million 
this amount is greater than the long term gas contract balance on our consolidated balance sheet due to our use of the units of revenue method of relieving the long term obligation versus a present value method applied under default provisions based on contractual agreements 
merchant tolling obligations because it is generally expected that the fuel and start up costs of operating merchant power plants will exceed the revenues that would be generated from the power sales  during the foreseeable future  we believe that under our merchant tolling agreements our capacity to generate power will largely be unutilized 
after including existing forward sales contracts  we expect to incur pretax losses and negative operating cash flows of approximately million in related to these contracts 
we are attempting to terminate or restructure these obligations 
if our tolling agreements that comprise a substantial portion of our capacity payments are not terminated or restructured on terms acceptable to our counterparties and us  our future earnings and cash flow will be negatively impacted 
off balance sheet arrangements the term off balance sheet arrangement generally means any transaction  agreement or other contractual arrangement to which an entity that we do not consolidate is a party  under which we have i any obligation arising under a guarantee contract  derivative instrument or variable interest  or ii a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to such entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit  liquidity or market risk support for such assets 
as of december   we have obligations under certain off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that may be material to investors as follows merchant loan portfolio in connection with our former portfolio of merchant loans to energy related businesses  we entered into commodity and interest rate swaps with the borrowers 
because of increases in natural gas prices and declines in interest rates  these swaps have increased in market value 
when we sold the portfolio of loans we retained these swaps 
as part of the sale agreement  we agreed that in the event these borrowers fail to meet their note obligations to the buyer of the portfolio  we could be required to share a portion of any proceeds we receive on these swaps with the buyer 
as of december  we have collected million related to these swaps  of which we have reserved million to cover this obligation 
the value of the unsettled portion of these swaps was million at december  guarantees we have guaranteed the performance of certain gas aggregators in connection with loans that were made by our wholesale energy trading business 
in connection with these agreements  we guarantee to pay the aggregators counterparties if the aggregators are unable to make their payments for the gas they have purchased 
we have terminated all of these agreements as of december  our exposure is limited to the outstanding payable balances of the aggregators as of the termination dates of these agreements 
our guarantees for these agreements at december  totaled million 
equity put rights certain shareholders of everest connections have the option to sell their share interests to us if everest connections does not meet certain financial and operational performance measures target based put rights as of december  if the target based put rights were exercised  we would be obligated to purchase up to million and million share interests at a price of and  respectively  for a total potential cost of million 
as a result of our reduced funding of this business  management assessed the likelihood of achieving these metrics and during recorded a probability weighted expense of million 
as of december   we reserved million for this obligation 
such shareholders also have the option to sell their share interests to us at fair market value market based put rights if they have not exercised their target based put rights 
the market based put rights expire on december  for million shares and do not expire for the remaining million shares 
we have not provided for this potential obligation as the exercise would represent an equity transaction at fair value 
capital expenditures we estimate future cash requirements for capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment additions will be as follows actual estimated future cash requirements in millions domestic utilities everest connections canadian utilities a merchant services corporate and other total capital expenditures a although our canadian utilities are included in the table above for  we anticipate closing the sale of those businesses in the first half of and therefore have not included canada s estimated capital expenditures for and following the sale  future capital expenditures will be the obligation of the buyer 
regulatory approvals required for financing we are required to obtain the prior approval of the ferc  kansas corporation commission and colorado public utilities commission prior to issuing long term debt or stock 
we currently have approval from the kansas commission and colorado commission to issue up to million of common stock and million of long term debt that is convertible into our common stock 
our application with the ferc for similar authority is pending 
we are required to obtain the prior approval of the ferc and kansas corporation commission to issue short term debt 
we have submitted an application to these agencies for approval to have outstanding up to million of secured or unsecured short term debt 
these applications are pending 
the use of our utility assets as collateral generally requires the prior approval of the ferc and the regulatory commission in the state in which the utility assets are located 
financial review this review of performance is organized by business segment  reflecting the way we managed our business during the periods covered by this report 
each business group leader is responsible for operating results down to earnings before interest and taxes ebit 
we use ebit as a performance measure as it captures the income and expenses within the management control of our segment business leaders 
because financing for the various business segments is generally completed at the parent company level  ebit provides our management and third parties an indication of how well individual business segments are performing 
therefore  each segment discussion focuses on the factors affecting ebit  while financing and income taxes are separately discussed at the corporate level 
the use of ebit as a performance measure is not meant to be considered an alternative to net income or cash flows from operating activities  which are determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  as an indicator of operating performance or as a measure of liquidity  or other performance measures used under gaap 
in addition  the term may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities

cumulative effect of accounting change 
net income loss key factors impacting continuing operating results our total loss before interest and taxes decreased significantly in compared to key factors affecting improved results were as follows as a result of asset sales and impairments  we recorded impairment charges and net losses on sale of assets of million in compared to  million in these impairments stemmed mainly from our decision to sell non core  international utility assets in order to return to operating primarily as a domestic electric and gas utility 
we exited from the wholesale energy trading business during the third quarter of and incurred trading and contract losses of million during related to our exit 
our losses in from this continued wind down were significantly lower 
in addition  our operating expenses decreased by approximately million from due to our exit from this business 
in  we incurred million of restructuring charges versus million of restructuring charges in in connection with the realignment of our domestic networks business and the exit from our wholesale energy trading business 
continued lower power prices and higher natural gas prices in resulted in narrow spark spreads the difference between the price at which electricity is sold and the cost of the fuel used to generate it which reduced or eliminated the economic benefits of running certain power plants and exercising power generation rights under our tolling contracts 
these conditions also negatively impacted our ability to sell additional generation capacity that came on line 
ebit  before impairments and restructuring charges  for capacity services in was down million when compared to equity and other earnings for our international networks segment  including impairment charges and net losses on sale of assets  decreased by million in compared to primarily due to the sale of its businesses in the fourth quarter of and in cumulative effect of accounting change in october  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus to rescind eitf no

by rescinding eitf  all contracts that would have otherwise been accounted for under eitf and that do not fall within the scope of statement of financial accounting standards no

we elected to adopt this requirement in october and thus reversed million or million on an after tax basis of earnings previously recognized

discontinued operations as further discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we have reported the results of operations of the following assets in discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of income our texas natural gas storage facility  our texas and mid continent natural gas pipeline systems  including our natural gas and natural gas liquids processing assets and our ownership interest in the oasis pipe line company  our west virginia coal terminal and our merchant loan portfolio that were all sold in and early  and our canadian network businesses and our consolidated independent power plants  lake cogen and onondaga  that we are in the process of selling 
we have reported the results of these businesses in discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of income

operating expense operating expense decreased million in compared to primarily due to the sale of our gas gathering and pipeline assets  our merchant loan portfolio and our coal terminal in and early impairment charges and net loss on sale of assets impairment charges and net loss on sale of assets consisted of million related to our consolidated independent power plants  lake cogen and onondaga 
in the third quarter of  we decided to proceed with the sale of these assets and therefore wrote these assets down to estimated fair value less costs to sell  which was less than their carrying value 
for a discussion of impairment charges and net loss on sales of assets  see versus below 
depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense decreased million in compared to when we classified our canadian utility as held for sale  we stopped recording depreciation expense for that business 
this decreased depreciation expense by million 
approximately million of the decrease in depreciation and amortization was due to the sale of our gas gathering and pipeline assets and our coal terminal in the fourth quarter of and early the remaining decrease was primarily due to the decision by the aeub to reduce the depreciation rates on most of our distribution assets in alberta 
equity in earnings of investments equity in earnings of investments decreased million due to the sale of our investment in the oasis pipe line company in the fourth quarter of other income other income decreased million in compared to  primarily due to the sale of our merchant loan portfolio in the fourth quarter of this business generated million of other income in in  we incurred an million charge related to a currency put option purchased to protect us from unfavorable currency movements on the canadian asset sale proceeds and million of foreign currency losses related to us dollar denominated debt issued by our canadian subsidiaries 
income tax benefit income tax benefit decreased million primarily due to pretax income in compared to a pretax loss in and the aeub decision discussed above 
this decision decreased sales and depreciation  however  only the sales impact is tax effected for canadian regulatory purposes 
in  million of our losses were treated as capital losses for income tax purposes 
because capital losses can only offset capital gains  and we do not have sufficient capital gains in prior years to offset all of these losses  nor can we be assured of generating future capital gains  we recorded a million valuation allowance against our capital loss carryforward 
in addition  the impairment charges and net loss on sale of assets included the effects of million of goodwill and other intangibles that were not deductible for income tax purposes 
these benefits were offset by income tax expense that was recorded for our canadian operations 
due to our decision to sell this business  we can no longer represent that cash from this business will be permanently reinvested 
therefore  additional deferred tax was recorded to account for taxes that will arise when we bring asset sales proceeds back to the united states 
in addition  approximately million of the impairment charge on our consolidated independent power plants is expected to be a capital loss for which we have provided additional valuation allowances 
versus sales  cost of sales and gross profit sales and cost of sales decreased million and million  respectively  resulting in a decrease in gross profit of million in compared to these decreases were primarily due to lower natural gas liquids prices and throughput volumes for compared to as a result  sales  cost of sales and gross profit from our gas gathering and pipeline business all decreased by million  million and million  respectively 
the sale of these operations on october   compared to a full fourth quarter of operations in  caused a further reduction in sales  cost of sales and gross profit of million  million and million  respectively 
also decreasing sales and cost of sales was the sale of the alberta retail operations in january cost of sales decreased an additional million in due to the deferral of additional excess purchased power costs in alberta that regulatory authorities later approved for recovery in future periods 
these decreases were offset by a million rate increase in british columbia and a million interim rate increase in alberta 
operating expense operating expense increased million in compared to this increase was primarily due to million of business development costs  million of costs associated with the integration of our british columbia and alberta operations and million of increased operating costs in our canadian networks 
impairment charges and net loss on sale of assets in  we incurred a million loss on the sale of our gas gathering and pipeline assets  a million loss on the sale of our merchant loan portfolio  a million impairment of our coal terminal  a million pretax gain on sale of our gas storage assets  a million impairment charge on a canadian power plant and million of other impairment charges 
depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense decreased in by million primarily as a result of the sale of our gas gathering and pipeline assets in october income tax expense benefit our losses resulted in an income tax benefit  as compared to income tax expense in due to earnings 
see discussion of significant valuation allowances recorded in on capital losses incurred by our discontinued operations under versus global networks group our global networks group consists of our investments in domestic and international regulated electric  gas and communications networks

additionally  our results for the two years ended december  include our ownership interest in quanta services  inc  a provider of field services to electric utilities  telecommunications and cable television companies  and governmental entities 
we began decreasing our ownership interest in quanta services in july and sold our remaining shares in february international networks included our equity method investments in australia  new zealand  the united kingdom and our wholly owned utility businesses in canada

sales and gross profit increased by million due to a rate increase in colorado effective in july and million of additional margin from favorable weather and customer growth 
these increases were offset by a million decrease in margin from off system sales and a million increase in cost of sales due to the higher cost of natural gas used to fuel our power plants  net of offsetting derivative positions 
sales and cost of sales for our regulated gas utilities increased million and million  respectively  in compared to  for a net increase in gross profit of million 
sales and cost of sales increased due to a increase in natural gas prices 
however  because gas purchase costs for our gas utility operations are passed through to our customers  the change in gas prices did not have a corresponding impact on gross profit 
gross profit for our regulated gas utilities increased primarily due to million in rate increases in michigan  iowa and nebraska  a million change in reserved funds released upon conclusion of multi year gas cost recovery filings in various states and customer growth of million 
non regulated gas sales  cost of sales and gross profit decreased million  million and million  respectively  in compared to  primarily as the result of the sale of our non regulated retail gas operations on september  other non regulated gross profit were higher by million in  primarily due to an increase in customers at everest connections

as a result  we have recorded all of everest connections losses in versus sales  cost of sales and gross profit sales and cost of sales for the domestic networks businesses decreased million and million  respectively  in compared to  resulting in a decrease in gross profit of million 
these changes were primarily due to the following factors regulated electric utility sales decreased million and cost of sales increased million in compared to  resulting in a gross profit decrease of million 
sales and gross profit decreased by million due to the missouri rate decision effective in march and by million due to decreased margins from off system sales  offset in part by million of additional margin from customer growth and favorable weather 
sales and cost of sales for our regulated gas utilities decreased million and million  respectively  in compared to  for a net decrease in gross profit of million 
sales and cost of sales decreased due to a decrease in natural gas prices 
however  because gas purchase costs for our gas utility operations are passed through to our customers  the change in gas prices did not have a corresponding impact on gross profit 
sales and gross profit decreased million as a result of the sale of certain missouri pipeline operations in january gross profit for our regulated gas utilities increased primarily due to million of interim rate increases in michigan and iowa 
non regulated gas sales  cost of sales and gross profit decreased million  million and 
million  respectively  in compared to  primarily as the result of the sale of our non regulated retail gas operations on september  and our missouri pipeline business in january operating expense operating expense decreased million in compared to the decrease was primarily due to reduced expenses in everest connections resulting from the elimination of costs associated with our telecommunications consulting operation in early  greater operating efficiencies and the suspension of incentive payments under the long term incentive plan 
although there were significant labor savings in our regulated business due to reductions in workforce and annual incentives  these amounts were offset by increased pension costs  costs associated with our proxy contest with quanta services and expenses related to certain regulatory matters 
restructuring charges as a result of the restructuring of our domestic utility business to more closely align it with our state service areas  we incurred million in restructuring costs  primarily in the form of severance for terminated employees and the disposition of our corporate aircraft operation 
impairment charges and net loss on sale of assets as further discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  domestic networks incurred losses of million resulting from impairments and asset sales in the impairments consisted primarily of million of impairment losses related to our investment in quanta services and million of impairment losses related to everest connections and other communication technology investments 
in addition  we recorded a million asset impairment charge related to a local natural gas distribution system deemed unrecoverable in one of our regulatory jurisdictions 
depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense decreased million  of which million was due to the elimination of goodwill amortization attributed to our quanta services investment and our acquisition of st 
joseph light power company 
also impacting depreciation and amortization expense was a million decrease in depreciation resulting from our missouri electric rate case 
these decreases were offset in part by a million increase in depreciation expense on additional communication networks placed in service during late and equity in earnings of investments equity in earnings of investments decreased million in compared to the decrease was primarily due to reduced equity earnings from our quanta services investment resulting from quanta services lower earnings in and a reduction of our ownership in quanta services from to during partially offsetting quanta services lower earnings was the elimination of approximately million of goodwill amortization that was previously in the quanta services financial statements 
other income other income decreased million in from this decrease was primarily due to the loss of interest earned in on the note receivable from enron  which was written off in three year review international networks the operating results for our canadian utility businesses have been reclassified as discontinued operations for all periods presented

in  we recorded impairment charges of million related to our investment in multinet gas and alintagas and million related to our investment in midlands 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further explanation 
equity in earnings of investments equity in earnings of investments decreased million in compared to this decrease was primarily due to the sale of our interest in unitednetworks limited in new zealand in october  which contributed equity earnings of million in  the recent sale of our australian investments which contributed million of equity earnings in compared to million in  and not recording equity earnings in from our midlands investment due to regulatory limitations on cash payments by midlands to its owners 
in  we received no cash dividends or payments for management fees which would have enabled us to recognize earnings on this investment 
our share of undistributed net earnings from midlands was million in during  we recorded equity earnings of million related to our midlands investment 
other income other income increased million in compared to this increase was primarily due to million of foreign currency gains recognized in the second quarter of due to the strengthening of the canadian dollar on us dollar obligations of a former canadian finance subsidiary not included in discontinued operations 
versus operating expense operating expense increased million in compared to this increase was primarily due to transition costs related to our midlands electricity acquisition 
impairment charges and net loss on sale of assets in  impairment charges mainly consisted of million related to our midlands investment and a million impairment charge related to our investments in multinet gas and alintagas in australia 
we determined these impairments based on the estimated fair value of these investments considering current market information  which included offers to purchase our interests in these businesses  as well as corresponding impairment charges being taken in the financial statements of the underlying business 
see note for further explanation 
equity in earnings of investments equity in earnings of investments increased million in compared to midlands  which was acquired in may  contributed million of the increase 
an additional million of the increase was due to goodwill no longer being amortized in the financial statements of our equity method investments due to the adoption of sfas gain on sale of subsidiary stock in october  through a public tender offer in new zealand  vector limited acquired all of the outstanding shares of unitednetworks limited unl  in which we had a indirect interest 
we realized a million pretax gain on the sale of this investment 
current operating developments midlands in october  we and firstenergy corp 
agreed to sell of the aquila sterling limited asl shares outstanding to a subsidiary of powergen uk plc for approximately million 
as a result of this agreement and our analysis of fair value surrounding this investment  in the third quarter of  we recorded an additional million pretax and after tax impairment charge to write this investment down to its estimated fair value 
we completed the sale of asl in january and received proceeds before transaction costs of million 
we estimate we will pay approximately million in transaction fees 
we expect to record a pretax and after tax gain of approximately million due to changes in the british pound exchange rate primarily in the fourth quarter of and early canada in september  we agreed to sell our canadian utility businesses for approximately c  million us  million at the december  exchange rate before the assumption or repayment of certain debt  closing adjustments  transaction costs and taxes 
the transaction is subject to approval of the regulatory commissions in alberta and british columbia  among other regulatory bodies  as well as other customary closing conditions  and is expected to close in the second quarter of if the sale does not close by june   the sale agreement will automatically terminate 
we expect to record a gain on this sale at the date of close 
the results of operations and related assets and liabilities of our canadian utility businesses are included in discontinued operations

merchant services we conduct our merchant services business through aquila merchant services  inc aquila merchant  which operates as two business segments  capacity services and wholesale services 
capacity services primarily owns  operates and contractually controls our non regulated power generation assets 
wholesale services includes our north american and european commodity  client and capital businesses 
in the first four months of  we owned of aquila merchant 
in april  approximately of aquila merchant was sold to the public 
for the remainder of  aquila merchant was consolidated and the minority interest was reflected in the financial statements 
in january  we acquired the outstanding public shares of aquila merchant in an exchange offer and merger 
the following capacity services and wholesale services financial information includes of aquila merchant before minority interest  which totaled million for the year ended december  three year review capacity services year ended december  in millions sales cost of sales gross profit loss operating expenses operating expense restructuring charges impairment charges and net loss on sale of assets depreciation and amortization expense total operating expenses other income equity in earnings of investments other income 
earnings loss before interest and taxes due to the rescission of eitf as previously discussed  we must now show our gains and losses from energy trading contracts on a net basis 
to the extent losses exceeded gains  as was our case in  sales are shown as a negative number 
versus sales  cost of sales and gross profit sales and cost of sales for our capacity services operations decreased approximately million and million  respectively  in compared to  resulting in a decrease in gross profit of million 
these decreases were primarily due to the following factors sales and cost of sales were approximately million and million lower  respectively  as higher prices for natural gas used as fuel in our merchant power plants and lack of profitable contracted sales agreements made it uneconomical to operate our non contracted merchant generating assets in compared to in and  we recorded million and million of mark to market losses  respectively  mainly related to unfavorable gas hedges and a long term power supply transaction 
we entered into the gas hedges to lock in the value of a heat rate swap held by our consolidated onondaga plant that is now recorded in our discontinued operations 
we expect the gas hedges to be liquidated after the closing of the sale of our independent power plant investments to teton power funding  llc see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the long term power supply transaction  which expires in  provides power at predetermined prices and matches the demand requirements of the customer 
cost of sales for primarily consists of fixed tolling capacity payments of million 
these monthly capacity payments give us the right to use certain natural gas fired power plants 
our future committed capacity payments are detailed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
operating expense operating expense decreased million primarily due to labor  benefit savings and lower corporate costs resulting from the restructuring of this business in restructuring charges during and  we recorded restructuring charges of million and million  respectively  relating to the termination of our remaining interest rate swaps associated with the construction financings for our clay county and piatt county power plants 
as debt related to these facilities was retired earlier than anticipated  our swaps exceeded our outstanding debt 
we therefore reduced our position and realized the loss associated with the cancelled portion of the swaps 
impairment charges and net loss on sale of assets during  we recorded million of impairment charges and net loss on sale of assets 
these charges consisted of million related to the write down of our equity method investments in independent power plants 
in the third quarter of  we decided to sell our interest in these plants and therefore wrote our investments down to estimated fair value  which was less than their carrying value 
impairment charges also includes a million payment for the termination our year tolling contract for the acadia power plant  partially offset by a million gain related to the contract termination and sale of certain turbines that we had previously written down to estimated fair value 
for impairment charges and net loss on sale of assets see versus below 
depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense increased million in compared to approximately million of this increase was due to a decrease in the estimated amortizable life of certain plant premiums relating to our acquisition of gpu international in december in addition  the start of commercial operations at three owned power plants contributed an additional million of depreciation and amortization expense in versus sales  cost of sales and gross profit sales and cost of sales for our capacity services operations decreased million and million  respectively  in compared to  resulting in a decrease in gross profit of million 
these decreases were primarily due to the following factors decreases in electricity prices resulted in lower sales and cost of sales  and the lack of pricing volatility reduced the opportunities to optimize our non contracted merchant generating assets with forward sales of power  both of which decreased gross profit in our non contracted merchant generation business relative to the mark to market gains of approximately million we recorded in in connection with our non contracted merchant generating assets  we make fixed capacity tolling payments evenly throughout the year 
for the year ended december   capacity tolling payments increased by million compared to as new plants became operational or were on line for a full year 
due to lower power prices in  this additional capacity was utilized on a limited basis at prices that were not sufficient to cover the fixed payments 
contract terminations due to counterparties reduced creditworthiness generated losses of million in operating expense operating expense increased million due to increased operating costs from additional power plants and gas storage coming on line 
this was partially offset by lower compensation expense resulting from the elimination of incentive compensation in restructuring charges in  we recorded restructuring charges of million relating to the termination of certain interest rate swaps associated with the construction financings for our clay county and piatt county power plants 
as debt related to these facilities was paid down earlier than anticipated  our swaps exceeded our outstanding debt 
we therefore reduced our position and realized the loss associated with the cancelled portion of the swap 
impairment charges and net loss on sale of assets impairment charges and net loss on sale of assets of million included million relating to the expected loss associated with either the sale or contract termination of four electric turbines that were sold or returned to the manufacturer in  million related to our exit from the lodi gas storage investment  million related to fees and expenses associated with the termination of the cogentrix acquisition  million of goodwill that was impaired under sfas and million of other impairments 
equity in earnings of investments equity in earnings of investments increased million due to million of continued strong operating performance from various independent power projects and million of increased earnings resulting from the recovery of accounts receivable that we reserved for in current operating development independent power plants in the third quarter of  we decided to proceed with the sale of our investments in independent power plants and in november  we entered into an agreement to sell our interest in of these plants 
we recorded an impairment charge to reduce the carrying amount of our interests in these plants to their estimated fair value based on preliminary bids received in the third quarter of two of the power plants  lake cogen and onondaga  are consolidated on our balance sheet 
we have included the results of operations from these plants in discontinued operations 
the remaining plants are equity method investments and their results of operations are included in continuing operations 
we expect to close this sale in march aries power project we are currently in discussions with our joint venture partner regarding the transfer of our interest in the aries power project and other consideration to our partner in exchange for the release from our remaining capacity tolling obligation 
if such a transaction were consummated  we would incur a loss 
earnings trend and impact of changing business environment the merchant energy sector has been negatively impacted by the increase in generation capacity that became operational in and this increase in supply has placed downward pressure on power prices and subsequently the value of unsold merchant generation capacity 
because it is generally expected that the fuel and start up costs of operating our merchant power plants will exceed the revenues that would be generated from the power sold we believe that during the foreseeable future we will have limited ability to generate power at a gross profit 
we will continue to have operating and maintenance cost associated with our owned merchant generation plants  whether the facilities are being utilized to generate power or are idle 
additionally  we will be required to make capacity payments related to our contracted merchant generating assets and expect to incur pretax losses and negative operating cash flows of approximately million in related to these contracts 
we are attempting to terminate or restructure these obligations 
as a result of the above factors and our change in strategy  we do not expect capacity services to be profitable in the next two to three years 
we attempt to optimize and hedge our power plants with forward contracts which qualify as derivative instruments 
when we enter into these positions  we account for them at fair market value under mark to market accounting 
the hedges are an offset to our power plants  which use accrual accounting 
because different accounting rules are used on each side of the transaction  this can cause significant fluctuations in earnings with limited impacts on cash flow 
capacity services has one long term power supply contract  discussed under versus sales  cost of sales and gross profit 
we may experience earnings volatility from this contract through due to its customized nature 
three year review wholesale services year ended december  in millions sales cost of sales gross profit loss operating expenses operating expense restructuring charges impairment charges and net loss on sale of assets depreciation and amortization expense total operating expenses other income expense equity in earnings of investments 
other income expense earnings loss before interest and taxes due to the rescission of eitf as previously discussed  we must now show our gains and losses from energy trading contracts on a net basis 
to the extent losses exceeded gains  as was our case in and  sales are shown as a negative number 
versus sales and gross profit loss gross loss for our wholesale services operations for was million  primarily due to the following factors because we decided to exit this business in  we were not adding new or speculative positions to our trading portfolio  which limited our earnings opportunities 
included in the million loss in was approximately million of non cash losses related to the sale of our capacity under certain long term gas transportation agreements at substantially less than our future commitments 
although the loss was recognized for accounting purposes  the cash associated with the loss will be paid out over the term of the contracts 
in addition  we recorded an million loss related to terminating additional trading contracts 
included in the million loss in was approximately million of non cash earnings related to the discounting of our trading portfolio 
substantially all of these earnings relate to our long term gas contracts 
during  average gas prices rose over the life of these contracts by 
per mmbtu  which caused both the price risk management asset and price risk management liability related to these contracts to increase in value 
however  because our price risk management liabilities are discounted based on our credit standing  versus our price risk management assets that are discounted at our counterparties credit ratings which on average are higher than ours  non cash mark to market gains were created 
see critical accounting policies on page for a full description of this accounting treatment 
as of december   we have recorded a cumulative million of mark to market gains related to discounting of our trading portfolio 
substantially all of these gains relate to our long term gas contracts discussed above 
these gains will be reversed in later periods as contracts settle  our credit rating improves and or as gas prices decline 
our remaining losses mainly stem from million of margin losses related to our long term gas contracts and million of unfavorable settlements related to our european merchant operation as we continue to wind down that business  offset by favorable non cash earnings related to our gas and power positions 
for a description of sales and gross profit for wholesale services operations see versus below 
operating expense operating expense decreased million primarily due to labor  benefit savings and related operating cost reductions resulting from the exit from our wholesale energy trading operations in  partially offset by million of accrued expense related to our january settlement with the cftc  and other regulatory review costs in restructuring charges restructuring charges decreased million in compared to this decrease stemmed from significant charges taken in for a description of restructuring charges see versus below 
impairment charges and net loss on sales of assets impairment charges decreased million in from this decrease is a result of significant impairments taken in for a description of impairment charges and net loss on sale of assets see versus below 
other income expense other income increased million in primarily due to two items 
on january   the eighth circuit court of appeals overturned a prior adverse decision of the united states tax court regarding the proper depreciable life of certain of our natural gas gathering and pipeline assets 
as a result of the appeals court s decision  we reversed the accrual of million of interest expense that would have been payable had the internal revenue service prevailed in the dispute 
we also realized foreign currency translation gains of million on the wind down of our european merchant operations 
versus sales and gross profit loss gross loss for our wholesale services operations for was million versus gross profit of million 
the following describes the major components of sales and gross loss in the second quarter of  we announced that we were exiting the wholesale energy trading business 
therefore  we were not increasing our trading portfolio in the second half of and had limited opportunities for earnings 
in the third and fourth quarters of  we generated gross margin losses of million 
approximately million of this loss related to balancing counterparty positions  reducing open positions and terminating existing contracts as a result of our decision to exit the wholesale energy trading business 
our remaining margin losses incurred in the last half of the year stem from unfavorable movements in credit  liquidity and interest reserves  unfavorable movements in trading positions  and unfavorable adjustments related to final settlements 
lack of price trends and lower volatility limited our opportunities to execute our trading strategy in the first half of  which reduced sales and gross profit by approximately million 
a volatile pricing environment in for gas and electricity provided opportunities to profitably execute our trading strategies and increase sales of our risk management products and services to our clients 
the volatility  particularly in the first half of  provided the strongest two quarters in wholesale services history 
operating expense operating expense decreased million primarily due to the elimination of incentive compensation expense in and lower compensation expense due to staff reductions related to our exit of the wholesale energy trading business 
restructuring charges in connection with the exit from our wholesale energy trading business in  we incurred million of restructuring charges 
these charges included million of severance and retention payments to terminated employees  million of excess leasehold improvements and equipment that were expensed when we vacated the related leased properties  million of lease costs connected to future lease commitments  million of losses associated with the exit from our retail aggregator loan business and million of other charges 
impairment charges and net loss on sale of assets impairment charges and net loss on sale of assets consisted primarily of an impairment charge of million related to goodwill associated with wholesale services that became unrealizable due to our exit from wholesale energy trading 
depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense decreased million due to the elimination of goodwill amortization  the write off in of certain interactive web based assets and the restructuring charge on leasehold improvements and equipment that have now been fully expensed and therefore are no longer subject to depreciation and amortization 
other income expense other income expense increased by million primarily due to a decrease in accounts receivable sale program fees following cancellation of the program in early and lower interest paid on customer margin deposits in earnings trend and impact of strategy change as previously stated  we began winding down and terminating our trading positions with our various counterparties during the third quarter of however  it will take a number of years to complete the wind down while we continue to deliver gas under our long term gas contracts 
because most of our trading positions are hedged  we should experience limited fluctuation in earnings or losses other than the impacts from counterparty credit  the discounting or accretion of interest  or the termination or liquidation of additional trading contracts 
we have one remaining highly customized actuarial based contract in wholesale services which expires in there may be earnings volatility associated with this contract due to its highly customized nature and our inability to completely hedge the associated risk 
using a long term value at risk methodology  with a confidence level  we estimate million of total exposure potential losses related to this contract

total operating expenses other income expense equity in earnings of investments 


gain on sale of subsidiary stock other income expense earnings loss before interest and taxes versus operating expense operating expense increased million in compared to  primarily due to an additional million of restructuring consulting fees and million of increased insurance and other costs associated with having non investment grade credit ratings 
this increase was partially offset by million of costs incurred in associated with retiring debt and company obligated preferred securities 
in addition  our losses on investments associated with the cash surrender value of certain life insurance policies were greater in than in restructuring charges restructuring charges decreased million in compared to this decrease was primarily due to million of executive severance costs recorded in in connection with the separation agreements with our former chief executive officer and chief financial officer 
other income expense other income increased million  mainly due to million of foreign currency gains in resulting from favorable movements in the australian and new zealand dollar against the us dollar 
in addition  included million of foreign exchange and interest rate hedge losses relating to our original planned financing structure that was not consummated in connection with our midlands acquisition  and more than million of losses related to technology related fund investments 
versus restructuring charges restructuring charges in includes million of executive severance in connection with the separation agreements discussed above 
other income expense other income expense decreased million in when compared to included in was million of foreign exchange and interest rate losses relating to our original planned financing structure that was not consummated in connection with the midlands acquisition 
also impacting were million of foreign currency losses on inter company loans and million of write downs on certain technology related fund investments 
we also paid approximately million in fees in the fourth quarter of in connection with the waiver of a covenant default on several bank financing agreements 
in addition  in we allocated million of additional expense to our merchant business that had no effect on the consolidated results 
however  it was a favorable adjustment in corporate and other in that did not occur in interest expense and income tax expense benefit the table below summarizes our consolidated interest expense and income tax benefit year ended december  in millions interest expense income tax expense benefit versus interest expense interest expense increased million in compared to the increase was primarily the result the following higher interest costs of million related to the million of senior notes issued in july  the borrowing in the second quarter of of million under our three year secured facility that resulted in million of additional interest expense  and amortization of debt issue costs of million mainly associated with the day secured credit facility and the three year secured facility 
these increases were offset in part by the retirement of our prior revolving credit facility  debt outstanding in australia  new zealand and the united kingdom in late and early  and the conversion of the premium equity participating securities to common equity in november income tax expense benefit the income tax benefit decreased million in compared to  primarily as a result of lower losses before income taxes in compared to  and due to the removal of our permanent investment elections in australia and canada in also impacting income tax benefits were a valuation allowance on anticipated capital losses associated with the sale of our equity method independent power plants  a valuation allowance on certain state tax loss carryforwards and a non deductible fine 
tax benefits were not recognized on a significant amount of the losses as a result of valuation allowances provided on capital losses and certain non deductible expenses 
versus interest expense interest expense increased million in compared to interest expense was higher primarily as a result of the following the issuance of million of senior notes in february  interest on debt relating to the acquisition of our interest in midlands in may  and the issuance of million of senior notes in july these increases were offset in part by lower rates on variable rate short term and long term debt and the retirement of million of company obligated preferred securities in in addition  we retired million of company obligated preferred securities and million of other long term notes in june income tax expense benefit income taxes decreased million in compared to  primarily as a result of our loss before income taxes in compared to record earnings in however  the expected income tax benefit was significantly reduced as a result of the following factors the tax benefit from a number of our asset sales or impairments generated substantial capital losses that were limited to available capital gains in the preceding three years and subsequent five years 
because capital gains within the carryback period were less than the loss and significant capital gains could not be assured in the foreseeable future  a million valuation allowance was established to offset our capital loss carryforward 
the million and million of impairment charges and asset sales related to wholesale services and capacity services goodwill  respectively  are considered a permanent difference between book and taxable income and do not result in the recognition of a tax benefit 
due to our need for capital and our change in business strategy  we sold our new zealand investment and we were in the process of exploring the sale of our australian  united kingdom and canadian investments 
as a result  we could no longer represent that cash from our international investments would be permanently invested in those countries 
therefore  additional deferred tax was recorded to account for taxes that would arise when we bring asset sale proceeds back to the united states 
as a result  we recorded additional taxes of million in other items critical accounting policies and estimates we have prepared our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
these statements include some amounts that are based on informed judgments and estimates of management 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
our critical accounting policies are subject to judgments and uncertainties that affect the application of such policies 
as discussed below  while we believe these financial statements include the most likely outcomes with regard to amounts that are based on our judgments and estimates  our financial position and results of operations may be materially different when reported under different conditions or when using different assumptions in the application of such policies 
in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual amounts  adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information 
our critical accounting policies include energy trading and derivative accounting the portion of our trading activities that qualify as derivatives under sfas is recorded under the mark to market method of accounting 
the market prices or fair values used in determining the value of our portfolio are our best estimates utilizing information such as closing exchange rates  over the counter quotes  historical volatility and the potential impact on market prices of liquidating our positions in an orderly manner over a reasonable amount of time under current market conditions 
as additional information becomes available  or actual amounts are determinable  the recorded estimates are revised 
as a result  operating results can be affected by revisions to prior accounting estimates 
operating results can also be affected by changes in underlying factors used in the determination of fair value of our portfolio such as the following we have variability in our mark to market earnings due to changes in the market price for gas and or power 
our portfolio is valued from current and expected future gas and power prices 
changes in these prices can cause fluctuations in our earnings 
we discount our price risk management assets and liabilities using risk free interest rates adjusted for our credit standing and the credit standings of our counterparties in accordance with sfas which is more fully described in statement of financial accounting concepts no 
 using cash flow information and present value in accounting measurement sfas concept 
because our price risk management liabilities are discounted using our credit standing  versus the receivable side of these transactions which are discounted based on our counterparties credit standings which on average are higher than ours  non cash mark to market earnings or losses are created 
as these spreads narrow  we record mark to market losses  as they widen  we record mark to market gains 
these gains and losses can fluctuate significantly if our credit or the credit of a group of our counterparties deteriorates or improves significantly 
we also have other activities in our utility operations that are accounted for under sfas the majority of these activities consist of the purchasing of gas  power and coal for our utility operations  which fall under the normal purchases and sales exception  and entering into transactions to hedge our risk associated with these purchases  which are accounted for as cash flow hedges 
these activities require that management make certain judgments regarding election of the normal purchases and sales exceptions and qualification of hedge accounting by identifying hedge relationships and assessing hedge effectiveness 
unbilled utility revenues sales related to the delivery of energy are generally recorded when service is rendered or energy is delivered to customers 
however  the determination of sales is based on reading customers meters  which occurs systematically throughout the month 
at the end of each month  an estimate is made of the amount of energy delivered to customers after the date of the last meter reading 
the unbilled revenue is calculated each month based on estimated customer usage  weather factors  line losses and applicable customer rates 
total unbilled revenues at december  were million 
impairment of long lived assets we review the carrying value of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying values may not be recoverable in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
unforeseen events and changes in conditions could indicate that these carrying values may not be recoverable and may therefore result in impairment charges 
an impairment loss is recognized only if the carrying amount of the long lived asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value 
the carrying amount of a long lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds its future undiscounted cash flows 
once deemed impaired  the long lived asset is written down to its fair value 
the determination of future cash flows  and  if required  fair value of a long lived asset is by its nature a highly subjective judgment 
fair value is determined by calculating the discounted future cash flows using a discount rate based upon our weighted average cost of capital  third party contracted bids or appraisals performed by a qualified party 
significant judgments and assumptions are required in the forecast of future operating results used in the preparation of the long term estimated cash flows  including long term forecasts of the amounts and timing of overall market growth 
changes in these estimates could have a material effect on the assessment of our long lived assets 
during  we evaluated the carrying value of three power peaking plants we own 
as of december   the carrying value of these plants was million 
we performed this evaluation due to reduced spark spreads and an oversupply of generation that we expect will continue for the foreseeable future 
this situation has prevented these plants from firing and  in turn  has created losses for us 
it is forecasted that these losses will continue for the next few years 
we separately tested the cash flows for each plant based on estimated margin contributions and forecasted operating expenses over their remaining plant lives 
these peaking plants were placed into service in and and we depreciate these facilities over years 
in evaluating future estimated margin contributions  we used external price curves based on four different future price environments 
in each environment  we calculated an average margin contribution based on a multi simulation scenario analysis and then equally weighted each price environment 
based on this analysis and the level of probability we would sell these assets  the undiscounted probability weighted cash flows for these plants exceeded their current book value 
therefore  under sfas no impairment was required as of december  we have evaluated these assets as held and used 
if at some future date we determine these assets are held for sale  based on current market values  we would likely record a material impairment charge 
goodwill and other intangible assets on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
under sfas we no longer amortize goodwill  but instead test it for impairment each year on november  and if impaired  write it off against earnings at that time 
other intangibles are to be tested for impairment in accordance with sfas as discussed above 
goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit  determined on a discounted cash flow basis or other fair market value methods  with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  then an impairment loss is measured by comparing the implied goodwill excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the fair value assigned to its assets and liabilities with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
we believe that the accounting estimate related to determining the fair value of goodwill  and thus any impairment  is a critical accounting estimate because it is highly susceptible to change from period to period because it requires us to make cash flow assumptions about future sales  operating costs and discount rates over an indefinite life  and the impact of recognizing an impairment could be material 
management s assumptions about future sales margins and volumes require significant judgment because actual margins and volumes have fluctuated in the past and are expected to continue to do so 
in estimating future margins and expenses  we use our internal budgets 
we develop our budgets based on anticipated customer growth  rate cases  inflation and weather trends 
total goodwill at december  was million 
regulatory accounting implications we currently record the economic effects of regulation in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation sfas 
accordingly  our balance sheet reflects certain costs as regulatory assets 
we expect our rates will continue to be based on historical costs for the foreseeable future 
however  if we no longer qualified for treatment under sfas  we would make adjustments to the carrying value of our regulatory assets and liabilities and would be required to recognize them in current period earnings 
total regulatory assets and liabilities at december  were million and million  respectively 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further details 
valuation of deferred tax assets we are required to assess the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets generated from net operating losses and capital losses incurred on the sale of assets 
this assessment takes into consideration tax planning strategies within our control  including assumptions regarding the availability and character of future taxable income 
at december   we have recorded million of valuation allowances against deferred tax assets for which the ultimate realization of the tax asset is mainly dependent on the availability of future capital gains and taxable income in certain states 
the ultimate amount of deferred tax assets realized could be materially different from that recorded  as impacted by changes in federal income tax laws and upon the generation of future capital gains to enable us to realize the related tax assets 
at december   we also had approximately million of net operating loss carryforwards that can be carried forward for years to offset future taxable income 
we did not record valuation allowances against the deferred tax assets related to net operating losses 
this determination was based on our assessment that it is more likely than not that we will realize these deferred assets during the carryforward period 
this assessment considered the forecast reversal of existing temporary differences and taxable income expected to be generated in the carryforward period 
pension plans our reported costs of providing non contributory defined pension benefits described in note to the consolidated financial statements are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience 
pension costs  for example  are impacted by actual employee demographics including age  compensation levels and employment periods  the level of contributions we make to the plan and earnings on plan assets 
changes made to the provisions of the plan may also impact current and future pension costs 
pension costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions  including anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the projected benefit obligation and pension costs 
pension plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments 
fluctuations in actual equity market returns as well as changes in general interest rates may result in increased or decreased pension costs in future periods 
likewise  changes in assumptions regarding current discount rates and expected rates of return on plan assets could also increase or decrease recorded pension costs 
as of september   our average assumed discount rate was and our average expected return on plan assets was 
the following chart reflects the sensitivities associated with a change in certain actuarial assumptions by the indicated percentage 
while the chart below reflects an increase in the percentage for each assumption  we and our actuaries expect that the inverse of this change would impact the projected benefit obligation pbo at december   and our estimated annual pension cost apc on the income statement for by a similar amount in the opposite direction 
each sensitivity below reflects an evaluation of the change based solely on a change in that assumption

legal proceeding in february  we filed a suit which is currently pending in the us district court for the western district of missouri against chubb insurance group  the issuer of surety bonds in support of certain of our long term gas contracts 
previously  chubb had demanded that it be released from its surety obligation of up to million or  alternatively  that we provide collateral to secure its obligation 
we do not believe that chubb is entitled to be released from its surety obligations or that we are obligated to provide collateral to secure its obligations unless it is likely we will default on the contracts 
chubb has not alleged that we are likely to default on the contracts 
if chubb were to prevail  it would have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and financial position 
we rely on other sureties in support of long term gas supply contracts similar to those described above 
there can be no assurance that these sureties will not make claims similar to those raised by chubb 
we have performed under these contracts since their inception and intend to continue to fully perform under these contracts significant balance sheet movements total assets decreased by  million since december  this decrease is primarily due to the following cash increased million 
see our consolidated statement of cash flows for analysis of this increase 
restricted cash decreased million primarily due to the release of cash held in escrow from the sale of our merchant loan portfolio  the use of restricted cash collateral to retire debt related to our piatt county and turbine construction credit facilities  offset by an increase in customer funds on deposit that were required to be restricted 
funds on deposit increased million primarily due to the cash collateralization requirement for our letters of credit and the requirement of suppliers of natural gas that we post margin deposits as a result of our non investment grade credit rating  offset by the return of margin deposits paid to counterparties due to the continued wind down of our wholesale energy trading portfolio in accounts receivable decreased  million primarily due to lower volumes of natural gas and electricity delivered due to our exit from wholesale energy trading  offset in part by increased natural gas prices since december  price risk management assets decreased million primarily due to a reduction in the number of trading contracts  partially offset by an increase in natural gas prices since december  prepayments and other decreased million primarily due to the collection in march of a million income tax refund which was recorded as a prepaid tax asset at december  investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries decreased by million primarily due to the sale of our australian investments in  as well as the million impairment charge in related to our equity method investments in independent power plants 
non current assets of discontinued operations increased million primarily due to an increase in the exchange rate on our canadian utility assets  partially offset by the million impairment charge in on the consolidated independent power plants 
total liabilities decreased by  million and common shareholders equity decreased by million since december  these changes are primarily attributable to the following accounts payable decreased by  million primarily due to lower volumes of natural gas and electricity delivered following our exit from wholesale energy trading  offset in part by increased natural gas prices since december  price risk management liabilities decreased million primarily due to a reduction in the number of trading contracts  partially offset by an increase in natural gas prices since december  current liabilities of discontinued operations increased by million primarily due to our canadian subsidiaries borrowing million under a day unsecured loan  partially offset by the repayment of current maturities of long term debt by our canadian subsidiaries 
short term and long term debt  including current maturities of long term debt  together decreased by million primarily due to the repayment of million of australian notes  million of debt related to our clay and piatt county power plants  million of revolving credit borrowings and million related to our turbine credit facility 
these decreases were offset by borrowings of million under our three year secured credit facility 
deferred income taxes and credits decreased million primarily due to current year losses and continued asset sales 
common shareholders equity decreased million primarily as a result of the million net loss in  partially offset by improved exchange rates on our foreign investments that created million of comprehensive income

forward looking information and risk factors this report contains forward looking information  including statements that i we expect to complete the sales of our investments in independent power plants in march and our canadian operations in the second quarter of  ii we believe our liquidity will be sufficient in  iii we expect our utility rates to be increased in certain states where we have utility operations  iv our long term liquidity depends upon the sale of assets  return of collateral posted  restructuring of capacity tolling obligations  our ability to refinance or retire maturing obligations  and our ability to issue equity or convertible debt securities  and v we do not expect that any of the currently pending litigation will have a materially adverse outcome to us 
the words may  will  should  expect  anticipate  intend  plan  believe  seek  estimate  or the negative of these terms or similar expressions identify further forward looking statements 
similar statements that identify our objectives  plans and goals are forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties  and there are certain important factors that can cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated 
some of the important factors and risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated include failure to complete the sales of our interests in independent power plants and our canadian operations would have a material adverse impact on our short term and long term liquidity 
regulatory commissions may refuse to approve some or all of the utility rate increases we have requested or may request 
counterparties may default on their obligations to pay  supply commodities  return collateral to us or to meet their obligations under commercial contracts  including those designed to hedge against movements in commodity prices 
our credit ratings and financial condition will limit our ability to access the capital markets we historically used to refinance our debt 
because we recently pledged a significant portion of our assets as collateral for loans  it will be more difficult for us to obtain additional financing 
we must obtain regulatory approvals to use the majority of our remaining unencumbered assets as collateral for additional loans  as well as issue additional debt 
we do not currently have these approvals 
market prices for our long term debt have increased  which limits our ability to repurchase the debt or obtain significant benefits from its early retirement 
our commitments under long term gas delivery contracts and capacity generation contracts will generate significant losses and negative cash flows for an extended period of time 
because these obligations represent favorable contracts to the counterparties  absent a risk of our default  they may be unwilling to restructure or settle the contracts 
courts and juries can be difficult to predict and it is possible that they would assess liability or damages in a manner significantly different than anticipated by us 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk trading we are exposed to market risk  including changes in commodity prices  interest rates and currency exchange rates 
to manage the volatility relating to these exposures  we enter into various derivative transactions in accordance with our policy approved by the board of directors 
our trading portfolios consist of natural gas  electricity  coal and interest rate contracts that are settled by the delivery of the commodity or cash 
these contracts take many forms  including futures  forwards  swaps and options 
as we are winding down our trading portfolio  most of our positions have been hedged to limit our exposure to the above risks 
we measure the risk in our trading portfolio using a value at risk methodology 
the value at risk calculation utilizes statistics to determine the relationship between the size of a potential loss and the probability of its occurrence  from holding an individual instrument or portfolio of instruments for a given period of time 
the quantification of market risk using value at risk methodologies provides a consistent measure of risk across diverse energy markets and products and is considered a best practice standard for this application 
the use of this methodology requires a number of key assumptions  including selection of a confidence level we use  holding period this is the time needed to liquidate a position we use one day  and use of historical volatility and correlations with the most recent activity weighted more heavily 
the average value at risk for all commodities during was million 
the value at risk limit is set by our board of directors 
we are currently limited to million for the remaining trading portfolio and a million target for the aggregate book that includes the first months of capacity services asset positions 
in addition to value at risk  we also apply other risk control measures that incorporate volumetric limits by commodity  loss limits  durational limits and application of stress testing to our various risk portfolios 
all merchant interest and foreign currency risks are monitored within the commodity portfolios and value at risk calculation 
the merchant commodity portfolios are valued on a mark to market basis that requires that the trading book be discounted on a net present value basis utilizing risk adjusted current interest rates based on our credit standing and those of our counterparties 
because interest rate movements impact the value of our trading portfolio  we actively hedge our interest rate exposures to limit these fluctuations 
the table below shows the expected net cash flows associated with the interest rate financial instrument related to our trading portfolio at december  dollars in millions variable to fixed rate 


average rate paid average rate received certain trading activities we engage in price risk management activities for both trading and non trading activities 
transactions carried out in connection with trading activities that are derivatives under sfas are accounted for under the mark to market method of accounting 
through october  these contracts were accounted for under eitf which also required the use of the mark to market method 
under sfas  our energy commodity trading contracts  including physical transactions mainly gas and power and financial instruments  are recorded at fair value 
as part of the valuation of our portfolio  we value the credit risks associated with the financial condition of counterparties and the time value of money 
we primarily use quoted market prices from published sources or comparable transactions in liquid markets to value our contracts 
if actively quoted market prices are not available  we contact brokers and other external sources or use comparable transactions to obtain current values of our contracts 
in addition  the market prices or fair values used in determining the value of the portfolio are our best estimates utilizing information such as historical volatility  time value  counterparty credit and the potential impact on market prices of liquidating our positions in an orderly manner over a reasonable period of time under current market conditions 
when market prices are not readily available or determinable  certain contracts are recorded at fair value using an alternative approach such as model pricing 
the changes in fair value of our trading and other contracts for are summarized below in millions total fair value at december  reduction in fair value during the year contracts realized or cash settled fair value at december  the fair value of contracts maturing in each of the next four years and thereafter are shown below in millions thereafter total prices actively quoted prices provided by other external sources priced based on models and other valuation methods net price risk management assets the following table reflects our fixed price volumetric positions for our remaining portfolio for both gas and electricity as of december  positive volumes represent net long positions and negative volumes represent net short positions 
thereafter total gas bcf 
electricity gwh  in connection with the sale of our independent power plants  we expect to sell a large swap related to one of those projects 
the sale of this contract will result in a net short position in our portfolio as indicated by the table above 
in the coming months  we will attempt to mitigate this exposure by flattening our positions in the marketplace 
we may be exposed to fluctuations in earnings during this period until our positions are flattened 
credit risk in conducting our operations  we regularly transact business with a broad range of entities and a wide variety of end users  energy merchants  producers and financial institutions 
credit risk is measured by the loss we would record if our counterparties failed to perform pursuant to the terms of their contractual obligations less the value of any collateral held 
we have established policies  systems and controls to manage our exposure to credit risk 
this infrastructure allows us to assess counterparty creditworthiness  monitor credit exposures  stress test the portfolio to quantify future potential credit exposures and catalogue collateral received by the company 
in addition  to enhance the ongoing management of credit exposure  we have used master netting agreements whenever possible 
master netting agreements enable us to net certain assets and liabilities by counterparty 
in situations where the credit quality of counterparties has deteriorated to certain levels  we will assert our contractual rights to minimize our exposures by requesting collateral against these obligations 
a natural result of our prior business strategy is the concentration of energy sector credit risk 
factors affecting this industry segment will affect the general credit quality of our portfolio both positively and negatively 
the result of energy industry downgrades of certain companies with significant energy merchant activity has reduced the overall credit quality of our exposures in general 
the following table details our credit exposures at december   associated with our forward positions within our trading portfolio and our billed receivables excluding residential customers  netted by counterparty where master netting agreements exist and by collateral to the extent any is held 
in millions investment grade non investment grade total utilities and merchants financial institutions oil and gas producers commercial and industrial total our credit exposure will diminish significantly in april as contracts expire and the winter season ends 
in our domestic utility business  approximately of our sales are to residential customers 
therefore  our credit risk associated with these sales is relatively low 
see pages and under properties for a breakout of our domestic utility customers by type 
currency rate exposure in  we reached an agreement to sell our canadian utility businesses for approximately c  million us  million at the december  exchange rate  including the repayment or assumption of c million us million at the december  exchange rate or net proceeds of approximately us million in proceeds to us before closing adjustments  transaction costs and taxes 
in addition  we will be required to repay us million borrowed by our canadian subsidiaries under a day unsecured loan 
we expect to close this sale in the second quarter of in connection with this sale  we entered into a foreign currency put option on c million of the expected cash proceeds from this sale to minimize the effects of declines in the canadian dollar against the us dollar 
this put option creates a floor of 
at which we can exchange c million  for a minimum of us million in cash 
this means that a increase in the value of the canadian dollar from the december  rate would increase the proceeds by approximately us million  while a decline in the canadian dollar from the december  rate would be limited to us million of decreased proceeds 
the remaining approximate c million has also been hedged with a forward contract to lock in the repayment of us million of us dollar denominated debt at our canadian subsidiaries 
we are in the process of winding down our remaining united kingdom and canadian merchant trading businesses  which are included in our wholesale services segment 
after the close of the sale of our canadian utility businesses and the wind down of our united kingdom and canadian merchant trading operations  we expect to have limited exposure to currency rates in the foreseeable future 
interest rate exposure we have approximately million in unhedged variable rate financial obligations 
a basis point change in the variable rate financial instruments would affect net income by approximately million
