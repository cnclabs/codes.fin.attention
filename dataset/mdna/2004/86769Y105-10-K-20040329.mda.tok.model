industry background high speed data access data traffic in the united states and canada has surpassed the amount of voice traffic carried on the existing telephone network 
consumers are seeking higher speed access to bandwidth intensive content and services  such as highly graphical web sites and audio  video  and software downloads 
as an increasing number of internet users access more and different content  the ability to connect to and receive data from the internet at high speeds has become and will continue to become more important 
one primary investment area is the redesign of the access network to support broadband access to end users 
this portion of the network between the customer s premise and the service provider s central office is also known as the last mile 
the last mile typically consists of copper wires that operate at substantially lower transmission speeds than those offered in the long haul segment of a network or by some available broadband alternatives 
these copper wires were originally intended to carry only analog circuit switched  low speed voice signals and  as a result  have become a bottleneck that limits high speed data transmission 
several access technologies are being deployed to support higher 
table of contents speed internet access in the networks  including digital subscriber lines  digital cable broadband  fiber optics  and broadband wireless 
in addition  the signaling portion of the network is essential to the integration of new broadband services into the existing telecommunications network 
we summarize some of these technologies below 
wireline access technology 
wireline access technology includes such technologies as plain old telephone service pots  t carrier  e carrier  isdn  and digital subscriber line technology 
digital subscriber line technology  commonly known as dsl  today transmits data up to times faster than a conventional dial up modem over a pots line using the existing copper telephone wires 
various implementations of dsl are being developed and deployed  including asymmetric dsl  known as adsl  symmetric dsl  know as sdsl  high bit rate dsl  known as hdsl  and integrated services digital network dsl  known as idsl 
service providers deploying dsl technology include incumbent local exchange carriers  such as sbc communications inc  verizon communications inc  and sprint corporation 
cable broadband networks 
cable broadband operators use two way cable  cable modems installed in the home  cable modem termination systems installed at major cable concentration points  and network headend equipment designed to connect their cable broadband networks to video feeds and other networks 
several cable companies are currently offering broadband access services across two way cable  including comcast  charter communications  cox  and timewarner cable 
fiber optics 
fiber optic cables use pulses of light to transmit digital information 
because fiber optic cables support thousands of high speed  local digital connections onto a single higher speed connection to the central office or the central side of the cable broadband network where the video signals emanate  they offer virtually unlimited bandwidth capacity 
due to their high capacity  fiber optic cables are being used increasingly in the access network in both telecommunications and cable broadband applications 
today  fiber optic cables carry higher bandwidths by increasing the wavelength modulation speed from gbps or by carrying multiple wavelengths on a single fiber 
common wavelength multiplexing schemes include coarse wavelength division multiplexing cwdm and dense wavelength division multiplexing dwdm 
signaling 
telephone systems require a signaling mechanism to set up and tear down phone calls 
these signals serve functions such as supervising or monitoring the status of a line or circuit to see if it is busy  idle  or requesting service  alerting or indicating the arrival of an incoming call  and addressing or transmitting routing and destination signals over the network 
signaling system  or ss  is the standard signaling system used by telecom networks worldwide 
signaling networks must support new access technologies to ensure interoperability with the existing telephone network 
the need for service verification equipment in order to successfully deploy and maintain broadband networks  service providers rely on sophisticated service verification equipment 
this equipment allows service providers to pre qualify facilities for services  verify proper operation of newly installed services  and diagnose problems 
in addition  equipment manufacturers use service verification equipment to test simulated networks during equipment development and verify the successful production of equipment 
service verification equipment can be grouped into the following three types field verification  remote testing  and alarm and surveillance 
field verification equipment 
field verification equipment is used by service providers to probe the actual wires  cables  or airwaves to verify that a service works 
in the case of a service malfunction  a field technician can use the equipment to locate the exact fault so that repairs can be made 
research and development labs  manufacturing departments  and central office technicians also use field verification equipment in their day to day operations 
of the three types of service verification equipment  field verification equipment delivers the most detailed service information 
service providers have found field verification to be an effective method to help to ensure that the lines operate properly 

table of contents remote test equipment 
remote test equipment can help verify services and identify certain types of service malfunctions from a centralized location 
the equipment is typically controlled by a centralized test system that automates much of the remote testing process 
it is commonly used to determine which section within a  mile circuit has malfunctioned and to diagnose quickly the nature of a customer s complaint 
due to its centralized and automated nature  remote test equipment is an efficient way to complement field test equipment in the deployment and maintenance of broadband networks 
alarm and surveillance equipment 
alarm and surveillance equipment constantly monitors the telephone network  searching for facility or service degradations  including outages 
when a problem is noticed  a report may be sent immediately to an automated trouble diagnostic system or to a human operator who interprets the message and decides what further action is required 
corrective action typically involves field verification or remote test equipment to identify and correct specific problems 
because the competition is intense for subscribers for high speed bandwidth access  the quality and reliability of network service has become critical to service providers who may lose customers and revenue and be subject to negative publicity as a result of providing poor service 
field technicians who use service verification equipment allow service providers to verify and repair service problems effectively and  thus  increase the quality and reliability of the network 
the sunrise solution we design and manufacture service verification equipment  physical layer diagnostic equipment  and monitoring systems that enable service providers to pre qualify facilities for services  verify newly installed services  monitor the performance of video and signaling networks  and diagnose problems relating to copper twisted pair  coaxial cable  and optical fibers 
our products also enable equipment manufacturers to test simulated networks during equipment development and verify the successful production of equipment 
our field products offer the following features design flexibility 
we design our products to be flexible and to evolve as customer needs change 
our cm  sunset mtt  and sunset xdsl product lines  for example  allow field technicians the ability to upgrade their equipment easily through a variety of plug in hardware modules 
this flexible design allows the customer to adapt the test set to new services and applications as network standards evolve 
customer driven features 
each of our products is tailored to our customers needs 
our marketing engineers interact with our customers during the design process to ensure that our products are the best available solution for them 
handheld design 
we use handheld designs for most of our products to be used in the field 
the compact  lightweight design of these products enhances field technicians ability to easily carry these devices with them to diagnose problems and verify line operation 
for example  the sunset ocx is the first asynchronous transfer mode atm fiber optic field test set small enough to be held in the palm of a technician s hand  and we believe that the sunset g is the world s smallest mbps to gbps sonet sdh test set available 
because of the design and functionality of our products  we provide the following benefits to our customers rapid and efficient deployment 
our products allow field and office technicians to test lines rapidly and efficiently to verify that they are properly connected to the central office and that they can support a specific type and speed of service 
in a single device  our products can be used to pre qualify facilities for services  identify the source of problems  and verify the proper operation of newly installed service before handing service over to customers

table of contents sales  marketing and customer service sales 
we sell our products to telecommunications service providers  cable network operators  network infrastructure suppliers and installers  technicians  and engineers through manufacturers representatives  independent distributor organizations  and our direct sales force 
in the united states  we sell our products through manufacturers representatives who are supported by our in house direct sales force 
manufacturers representatives are paid on a commission basis and have exclusive rights in their respective regions 
our manufacturers representatives or direct salesmen solicit orders from the customer  and we ship our products directly to the customer 
we pay commissions once we have received payment from the customer 
our direct sales force includes a team of regional sales managers who direct the efforts of our manufacturers representatives and regional account managers who focus on specific accounts within a region 
outside the united states  we sell our products through a mix of our own sales offices and independent distributor organizations  which are directed by our regional directors of marketing and sales 
in general  we sell our products to the distributor at a discount from the end user price  and the distributor or sales office then resells the products to the end user 
international sales  including north american sales to canada  were million or of total net sales in  million or in  and million or in we expect that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our net sales in future periods 
in addition to our network of international distributors  we have sales offices based in anjou  canada  beijing  china  tokyo  japan  seoul  korea  modena  italy  geneva  switzerland  and stuttgart  germany 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk factors affecting future operating results risks of international operations 
we sell our products predominantly to large telecommunications and cable service providers 
these types of customers generally commit significant resources to an evaluation of our and our competitors products and require each vendor to expend substantial time  effort  and money educating them about the value of the vendor s solutions 
consequently  sales to this type of customer generally require an extensive sales effort throughout the prospective customer s organization and final acceptance of our products by an executive officer or other senior level employee 
the result is lengthy sales and implementation cycles  which make sales forecasting difficult 
in addition  even after a large service provider has approved our product for purchase  their future purchases are uncertain because we generally do not enter into long term supply agreements or requirements contracts with those parties 
delays associated with a customers internal approval and contracting procedures  procurement practices  and testing and acceptance processes are common and may cause potential sales to be delayed or foregone 
as a result of these and related factors  the sales cycle of new products for large customers typically ranges from six to twenty four months 
we generally do not sell our products with rights of return  on the few occasions when we have agreed to provide customers with rights of return  we have deferred recognition of sales revenue until the rights of return have lapsed 
we also generate a relatively small amount of revenue from the sale of extended warranties on our products 
we defer this revenue and recognize it evenly over the term of the extended warranties 
we generally do not provide extended payment terms to our customers 
marketing 
we market and promote sales of our products by the following activities our product marketing group researches new opportunities  prepares product definitions with our research and development group  and defines new features to create new products  the overall marketing group hosts a variety of seminars several times a year in the united states  asia  europe  and latin america to improve the sales effectiveness of our manufacturers representatives and international distributors  
table of contents our product marketing engineers  regional sales managers  and account managers travel extensively with our manufacturers representatives and international distributors to develop new product opportunities with customers and to support their presentations  the marketing communications group maintains a public web site  publishes brochures and specification sheets  and generates press releases and publicity to increase our recognition in the telecommunications industry  our technical publications group prepares user s manuals  field manuals  quick reference guides  and product operation videos to serve the needs of our users  and our training department prepares customer training presentations and sponsors sunrise university  a factory based training program for our customers 
customer service 
we believe that customer service following the sale of our products is a critical ingredient to our success 
we provide customer service in numerous ways  including the following providing rapid instrument repair services  operating a hour per day telephone support line to help customers who are having difficulty using our products in their particular application  maintaining a proprietary web site containing on line  up to the minute product repair information for our distributors international repair centers  with a factory certified technician training program for our distributors international repair center technicians  and measuring the satisfaction of our customers and communicating this information internally for corrective action 
seasonality our sales have been seasonal in nature and tied to the buying patterns of our customers 
prior to  the largest volume of quarterly sales had usually been during the last calendar quarter of the year  as customers spent the unused portions of their annual budgets 
in and  there was a change in this fourth quarter seasonality as our customers had fewer remaining unused budget dollars available to generate an increase in the fourth quarter seasonal sales 
in  however  we saw a return to the pre pattern  with increased sales in the fourth quarter 
also in  our fourth quarter was our largest quarter of the fiscal year with sales of million 
however  our fiscal year visibility is limited  and we expect that our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly and will be difficult to predict due to the lengthy and unpredictable buying patterns of our customers  the degree to which our customers allocate and spend their yearly budgets  and the timing of our customers budget processes 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk factors affecting future operating results quarterly fluctuations 
backlog our backlog of customer orders at december  was approximately million compared to approximately million at december  prior to the time of shipment  customers may cancel orders that they have placed with us  but they must reimburse us for any production costs incurred prior to the cancellation 
order cancellations have historically not been significant in relation to our order backlog 
variations in the size and delivery schedules of purchase orders that we receive  as well as changes in customers delivery requirements may result in substantial fluctuations in the amount of backlog orders for our products from quarter to quarter 

table of contents research and development our engineering personnel have expertise in a number of fields  including interfacing test equipment with digital loop carriers  voice and data switching technology  local loop equipment  and operations support systems 
we spent approximately million on research and development in  million in  and million in research and development represents our largest direct employment expense 
at december   we had a total of employees engaged in research and development in san jose  california  norcross  georgia  anjou  canada  modena  italy  taipei  taiwan  and geneva  switzerland 
we believe that our continued success depends on our ability to anticipate and respond to changes in the telecommunications industry and anticipate and satisfy our customers preferences and requirements 
accordingly  we continually review and evaluate technological and regulatory changes affecting the telecommunications industry and seek to offer products and capabilities that solve customers operational challenges and improve their efficiency 
in general  we spend from two months to four years developing a new product 
regulations and industry standards our products are designed to comply with a significant number of industry standards and regulations  some of which are evolving as new technologies are deployed 
in the united states  our products must comply with various regulations defined by the federal communications commission and underwriters laboratories as well as industry standards established by telcordia technologies  inc  formerly bellcore  and the american national standards institute 
internationally  our products must comply with standards established by the european committee for electrotechnical standardization  the european committee for standardization  the european telecommunications standards institute  telecommunications authorities in various countries  and with recommendations of the international telecommunications union 
the failure of our products to comply  or delays in compliance  with the various existing and evolving standards could negatively impact our ability to sell our products 
manufacturing and sources of supply our production process consists of planning  procurement  fabrication  rework  system assembly  system final test  software option customization  and shipping

in  we increased our manufacturing capacity in taiwan  while reducing capacity in san jose to reduce overall production costs 
our taiwan subsidiary  taiwan sunrise telecom company limited  is a turn key manufacturer and local procurement operation 
we intend to continue increasing the use of our taiwan subsidiary for complete turn key manufacturing to help lower our manufacturing costs 
in our manufacturing process  we purchase many key products  such as microprocessors  bus interface chips  optical components  and oscillators  from a single source or from that source s sole supplier 
we rely exclusively on third party subcontractors to manufacture certain sub assemblies  and we have retained  from time to time  third party design services in the development of our products 
we do not have long term supply agreements with these vendors 
in general  we make advance purchases of some products and components to help to ensure an adequate supply

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
overview we manufacture and market service verification equipment that enables service providers to pre qualify facilities for services  verify newly installed services  and diagnose problems relating to telecommunications  cable broadband  and internet networks 
our products offer broad functionality  leading edge technology  and compact size to test broadband services  these include wireline access services including dsl  fiber optics  cable broadband networks  and signaling networks 
we design our products to maximize technicians effectiveness in the field and to provide realistic network simulations for equipment manufacturers to test their products 
our customers include incumbent local exchange carriers  cable companies  competitive local exchange carriers  and other service providers  network infrastructure suppliers  and installers throughout north america  latin america  europe  africa  the middle east  and the asia pacific region 
for the past three years  many companies in the telecommunications industry throughout the world have been experiencing decreased profitability resulting from many factors 
the most significant of these factors are overbuilding of certain portions of the telecommunications infrastructure during the late s and increased overlap between the previously separate businesses of wireless  local telephone services  and cable tv service  which has lead to increased competition 
we have been affected by this downturn  and after nine consecutive years of profitability  we were unprofitable during each of the years ended december  and however  through conservative financial management  we continued to generate positive cash flows from operating activities during those two years  and we ended the year with a strong cash position and very low debt levels 
we compete in the challenging telecommunications equipment market by pursuing a strategy of offering products that address the needs of a diverse group of telecommunications service providers and by investing heavily in research and development to create high quality products that address evolving telecommunications technologies in innovative ways 
we also continuously work to minimize operating costs while executing this strategy 
we assess the overall performance of our business primarily through the use of financial metrics 
management considers several factors to be particularly important when assessing past business success and projecting future performance 
the first such factor is our maintenance of high levels of working capital and low levels of debt 
see liquidity and capital resources 
this first factor is enabled by the second factor the generation of cash flows from our operating activities 
ultimately  our ability to consistently generate substantial positive cash flows is the primary indicator of our business s success and is imperative for our business s survival 
see liquidity and capital resources 
the third factor is profitability 
in general  profitability provides an indication of our ability to generate present and future cash flows from our operating activities 
the key components of our profitability are net sales  cost of sales  and operating expenses 
see the discussion directly below and comparison of years ended december  and and comparison of the years ended december  and sources of net sales we generate our cash flows primarily from selling telecommunications network testing equipment  and our future cash flows are largely dependent on our continuing ability to sell our products and collect cash from our customers for 
table of contents those sales 
we consider investment in research and development and selling and marketing activities and the continued development of new products to be critical to our ability to generate strong sales volume in the future  and we continually seek to offer new products to meet our customer s needs 
notably  in we introduced modules for our hand held sunset mtt product line  which tests a variety of types of network  and for our sunset stt  which is primarily a fiber optics testing product  and the realworx cable broadband testing product 
during the three years ended december   our research and development efforts have not generated the sales volumes to which we had previously been accustomed 
we sell our products predominantly to large telecommunications service providers 
these types of customers generally commit significant resources to the evaluation of our and our competitors products and require each vendor to expend substantial time  effort  and money educating them about the value of the proposed solutions before the customer agrees to purchase any amount of product 
as a result of these and related factors  the sales cycle of new products for large customers typically ranges from six to twenty four months 
during the past three years  we have observed a significant decline in capital spending in the telecommunications industry  which may lengthen the sales cycle further 
substantially all of our sales are made on the basis of purchase orders rather than long term agreements or requirements contracts 
as a result  we commit resources to the development and production of products without having received advance or long term purchase commitments from customers 
we anticipate that our operating results for any given period will continue to be dependent to a significant extent on purchase orders  which can be delayed or cancelled by our customers without penalty 
historically  a significant portion of our net sales have come from a small number of relatively large orders from a limited number of customers 
one customer  sbc communications inc  comprised million  or  of our sales in no customers comprised more than of our sales in and overall  we anticipate that our operating results for a given period will be dependent on a small number of customers 
our sales have been seasonal in nature and tied to the buying patterns of our customers 
prior to  the largest volume of quarterly sales had usually been during the last calendar quarter of the year  as customers spent the unused portions of their annual budgets 
in and  there was a change in this fourth quarter seasonality as our customers had fewer remaining unused budget dollars available to generate an increase in the fourth quarter seasonal sales 
in and  however  we saw a return to the pre pattern  with increased sales in the fourth quarter 
market conditions in our industry are currently too uncertain for us to predict whether or not this pattern will continue 
we expect that our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly and will be difficult to predict due to the length and unpredictable buying patterns of our customers  the degree to which our customers allocate and spend their yearly budgets  and the timing of our customers budget processes 
currently  competition in the telecommunications equipment market is intense and is characterized by declining prices 
because of these market conditions and potential pricing pressures from large customers in the future  we expect that the average selling price for our products will decline over time 
if we fail to reduce our production costs accordingly or fail to introduce higher margin new products  there will be a corresponding decline in our gross margin percentage 
see risk factors affecting future operating results competition and risks of the telecommunications industry 
a substantial portion of our net sales have come from customers located outside of the united states  and we believe that future growth may depend on growth of our sales in international markets 
these sales are primarily dollar denominated  which limits our financial exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations 
currently  we maintain a manufacturing facility in taipei  taiwan  manufacturing  research  development  and sales facilities in modena  italy  manufacturing  research  development  and sales facilities in anjou  canada  and research and development facilities in geneva  switzerland and mannheim  germany 
we also have a representative liaison office in beijing  china  and sales offices in tokyo  japan  seoul  korea  stuttgart  germany  and barbados 

table of contents we have a small amount of sales denominated in euros and the canadian dollar and have  in prior years used derivative financial instruments to hedge our foreign exchange risks 
as of december   we had no derivative financial instruments 
to date  foreign exchange exposure from sales has not been material to our operations 
we have also been exposed to fluctuations in non us currency exchange rates related to our manufacturing activities in taiwan 
in the future  we expect that a growing portion of international sales may be denominated in currencies other than us dollars  thereby exposing us to gains and losses on non us currency transactions 
see risk factors affecting future operating results risks of international operations 
cost of sales our cost of sales consists primarily of the following direct material costs of product components  manuals  product documentation  and product accessories  production wages  taxes  and benefits  allocated production overhead costs  warranty costs  the costs of board level assembly by third party contract manufacturers  and scrapped and reserved material purchased for use in the production process 
we recognize direct cost of sales  wages  taxes  benefits  and allocated overhead costs at the same time we recognize revenue for products sold 
we expense scrapped materials as incurred 
if we underestimate our requirements  we may have inadequate inventory  resulting in additional product costs for expediting delivery of long lead time components 
an increase in the cost of components could result in lower margins 
additionally  these long lead times have in the past  and may in the future  cause us to purchase larger quantities of some parts  increasing our investment in inventory and the risk of the parts obsolescence 
any subsequent write off of inventory could result in lower margins 
see risk factors affecting future operating results dependence on sole and single source suppliers 
operating costs we classify our operating expenses into three general operational categories research and development  selling and marketing  and general and administrative 
our operating expenses include stock based compensation expense and amortization of certain intangible assets 
we classify charges to the research and development  selling and marketing  and general and administrative expense categories based on the nature of these expenditures 
although each of these three categories includes expenses that are unique to the category type  each category also includes commonly recurring expenditures that typically relate to all of these categories  such as salaries  amortization of stock based compensation  employee benefits  travel and entertainment costs  communications costs  rent and facilities costs  and third party professional service fees 
the selling and marketing category of operating expenses also includes expenditures specific to the selling and marketing group  such as commissions  public relations and advertising  trade shows  and marketing materials 
the research and development category of operating expenses includes expenditures specific to the research and development group  such as design and prototyping costs 
the general and administrative category of operating expenses includes expenditures specific to the general and administrative group  such as legal and professional fees and amortization of identifiable intangible assets 
we allocate the total cost of overhead and facilities to each of the functional areas that use overhead and facilities based upon the square footage of facilities used or the headcount in each of these areas 
these allocated charges 
table of contents include facility rent  utilities  communications charges  and depreciation expenses for our building  equipment  and office furniture 
in and  we recorded amortization of deferred stock based compensation expense of million and million  respectively  related to the grant of pre ipo options to purchase our common stock at exercise prices subsequently deemed to be below fair market value 
total compensation expense related to these options  which were granted in and the first quarter of  is amortized on a straight line basis  over the respective four year vesting periods of the options  to the departments of the employees who received these below market option grants 
the options were fully amortized by the end of during and  we allocated amortization of deferred stock based compensation expense of million to cost of sales  million to research and development expense  million and million  respectively  to selling and marketing expense  and million and million  respectively  to general and administrative expense 
at december   million of deferred stock based compensation expense remained to be amortized and will be amortized during also  during and  we charged million to general and administrative expense for amortization of intangible assets obtained in business acquisitions 
acquisitions and consolidation of wireless operations on january   we acquired avantron technologies  inc avantron  a canadian company that specializes in the design and manufacture of cable broadband spectrum analyzers and performance monitoring systems  for million in cash  acquisition costs  and short term notes payable 
we accounted for this acquisition using the purchase method of accounting  and  accordingly  recorded goodwill and other intangible assets of million  to be amortized on a straight line basis over their original estimated useful lives of five years 
at december   we had million in unamortized goodwill remaining from the avantron acquisition 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we ceased amortizing this goodwill as of january  we review goodwill for impairment annually as required by sfas no 
on february   we acquired the calan cable tv test business from agilent technologies for million in cash and acquisition costs 
we recorded acquired identifiable intangible assets of million  to be amortized on a straight line basis over their original estimated useful lives of two and a half to five years  and goodwill of million  which we review for impairment annually 
on june   we acquired the adsl tester business from integrated telecom express  inc itex for  in cash 
we recorded goodwill of  which we review for impairment annually 
on september   we acquired luciol instruments sa luciol  a swiss corporation specializing in fiber optic measurement and instrumentation  for million in cash and acquisition costs 
we recorded acquired intangible assets of million  to be amortized on a straight line basis over their original estimated useful lives of five years  and goodwill of million  which we review for impairment annually 
concurrent with this acquisition and as amended in february  we entered into non compete agreements with certain former owners of luciol that will result in payments to the former owners totaling approximately  over four years  provided that they perform as stipulated under the agreements 
we are amortizing the corresponding non compete assets on a straight line basis over their four year estimated useful lives 
we also entered into  and amended in february  employment agreements with these same former owners that will result in bonus payments to the former owners totaling approximately  over four years  in addition to their regular salaries and subject to certain conditions  primarily related to their continued employment by us 
on february   we acquired substantially all of the assets of gie gmbh gie  a german corporation located in mannheim and specializing in wireless and rf measurement instrumentation  for million in cash and 
table of contents acquisition costs 
we recorded acquired intangible assets of  of which  was assigned to in process research and development assets that were written off at the date of the acquisition 
the remaining  of acquired intangible assets is developed technology 
we did not record any goodwill on this acquisition 
concurrent with this acquisition  we entered into a non compete agreement with certain former owners of gie obligating us to make payments to the former owners totaling approximately  over four years  provided that they perform as stipulated under the agreements 
we are amortizing the corresponding non compete assets on a straight line basis over their four year estimated useful lives 
we also entered into employment agreements with these same former owners obligating us to make bonus payments to the former owners totaling approximately  over four years  in addition to their regular salaries and subject to certain conditions  primarily related to their continued employment by us 
as of august  two of the three former owners of gie were no longer employed by us 
based on this fact and other actions by the former owners that we believe breech the terms of their agreements with us  we might not be required to pay these former owners the bonus or non compete payments specified under the acquisition related agreements 
as our wireless product development process proceeded  we determined that we would not make significant use in our wireless product designs of the developed technology that we capitalized at the time of the gie acquisition  so we wrote off the remaining unamortized balance of  during the fourth quarter of during the three month period ended september   we initiated a plan to move our wireless product research and development operations from mannheim  germany to our existing facility in santa rosa  california  and we modified this plan during march to move these operations to our corporate headquarters in san jose  california 
we expect that this consolidation will allow us to make the best use of our engineering talent and to closely control the wireless product development operations 
we expect that the wireless operations in san jose will be conducted by existing staff from the san jose and santa rosa facilities  augmented by additional hires  as needed 
except for the research and development activities of one employee  which we expect will be completed in march  all operating activities in our mannheim location had ceased by december  as a result of closing the mannheim office  we wrote off the book value of the remaining fixed assets and recorded a provision for the remaining future payments under the facility lease  both of which we included as charges against other income  net on our consolidated statement of operations 
we have not identified any additional material future costs to be incurred as a result of closing the mannheim facility 
additional costs  including lease termination costs and employee related costs  may become apparent during as a result of negotiating the termination of the mannheim office lease and if terminated employees claim and are allowed additional  unanticipated severance benefits  but we do not expect that any such additional costs would be material to our financial position or results of operations 
we believe that acquisitions and joint ventures may be an important part of our growth and competitive strategy 
see risk factors affecting future operating results acquisitions 
subsequent events on january   we  with our subsidiary luciol and a former owner of luciol  settled an intellectual property dispute over certain technology for testing fiber optic communication networks 
in the settlement  we agreed to pay  to certain other parties in order to settle all their claims to the intellectual property 
under the terms of our acquisition of luciol  we are entitled to indemnification of this amount from the three former owners of luciol  who are all now our employees 
during january  we agreed with these former owners to accept  as payment in full of the reimbursement to which we are entitled 
in february  we amended the terms of the employment agreements with these former owners of luciol to reduce the bonus and non compete payments to be paid to them by approximately  as the means to provide the reimbursement due to us 
the remaining  of the settlement amount is covered by a provision for litigation in this same amount that was established by us at the time of the luciol acquisition 
on january   our board of directors declared a million dividend  to be paid on february  to stockholders of record as of february  
table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth certain operating data as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated percentage of net sales years ended december  net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses research and development selling and marketing general and administrative total operating expenses income loss from operations other income  net income loss before income taxes income tax expense benefit net income loss comparison of years ended december  and net sales 
net sales increased  to million in from million in during  sales of our wireline access products increased by million or  sales of our fiber optics products increased by million or  and sales of our signaling products increased by million or over sales in the prior year 
these sales increases were generally due to increased demand for our products resulting from our continuing penetration of diverse geographic markets with product lines that we continue to enhance in terms of breadth  functionality  and performance 
in particular  the introduction of a number of new modules for our mtt and stt platforms drove sales in our wireline and fiber optics product lines 
our overall sales increase was limited by a million or decrease in sales of our cable broadband products 
this decrease resulted primarily from a decline in sales to our north american cable broadband customers  who restricted capital expenditures during after a period of significant expansion of their networks through  and increasing competition in the hand held installation and field testing part of the business 
during  sales decreased million or in north america  increased million or in europe africa middle east  and increased million or in asia pacific compared to sales were essentially unchanged in latin america 
the decrease in north american sales is primarily the result of decreased sales of cable broadband products 
our growth in asia reflects the results of our ongoing development of distribution channels in these regions  and our growth in europe is a rebound from a particularly weak year international sales  including north american sales in canada  increased to million  or of net sales  in  from million  or of net sales  in cost of sales 
cost of sales increased  to million in from million in this increase is primarily due to the shift in sales from north america to the international market  where our margins are lower 
cost of sales represented and of net sales in and  respectively 
although cost of sales was almost the 
table of contents same as a percentage of sales in and  this percentage is susceptible to change from variations in our product mix  changes in the proportion of our sales going to international customers  and pricing pressures 
research and development 
research and development expenses decreased  to million in from million in this decrease is primarily due to reduced parts and prototype and design service costs 
research and development expenses represented of net sales in and of net sales in research and development expenses tend to fluctuate from period to period  depending on requirements at the various stages of our product development cycles 
through our research and development activities  we are attempting to balance two conflicting strategic priorities 
the first is to tightly control costs in response to sales volume that has significantly decreased over the last three years 
the second is to continue to develop products that address customer needs in a rapidly changing and very competitive market 
in any given time period  research and development expenses may increase in absolute dollars and or as a percentage of sales as we continue to invest in product development and expand our product lines 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses increased  to million in from million in selling and marketing expenses represented of net sales in and during and  we reached a level of selling and marketing effort that allowed us to actively promote our products to potential customers  but that simultaneously recognized the cost constraints that we face during a period of economic difficulty in the telecommunications industry 
however  in the future  selling and marketing expense may increase in absolute dollars and or as a percentage of sales as we continue to develop our selling and marketing capabilities 
in addition  the commission expenses included in selling and marketing can fluctuate both with changes in sales volume and with changes in the channels through which the sales flow 
we use different distribution methods to supply our products to different geographical regions and different customers  and the commission rates we incur can vary among these channels 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses decreased  to million in from million in the main reason for this decrease was a reduction in bad debt expenses related to uncollectible accounts receivable 
since  we have experienced a trend of decreasing uncollectible accounts receivable 
we believe that the reason for this trend is that many of our customers with questionable financial resources have gone out of business or have reduced the scope of their operations as a result of the telecommunications downturn and that those customers that continue to buy from us are those with the most financial resources to pay for their purchases 
general and administrative expenses represented of net sales in and of net sales in we try to carefully control our general and administrative expenses 
however  general and administrative expenses may increase in absolute dollars if we experience growth in our business  expand our infrastructure  or pursue additional acquisitions 
general and administrative expenses could increase as a percentage of sales if we experience increased costs related to our collection of receivables  if unforeseen legal matters arise  and if regulatory or public company compliance costs  including costs related to complying with the sarbanes oxley act of and its associated regulations  increase 
other income  net 
other income  net primarily represents interest earned on cash and investment balances and gains and losses on assets  liabilities  and transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
other income  net remained unchanged at million in and income tax expense benefit 
income tax expense benefit consists primarily of federal and state income taxes 
we recorded an income tax benefit associated with our operating losses of million in and million in our effective income tax rates were in and in comparison of years ended december  and net sales 
net sales decreased  to million in from million in during  sales of our wireline access products decreased by million or  sales of our fiber optics products decreased by 
table of contents million or  and sales of our signaling products decreased by million or from sales in the prior year 
these sales decreases were generally due to reductions in capital spending by our customers in the telecommunications industry 
these sales decreases were partially offset by a million or increase in sales of our cable broadband products 
of the increase in cable broadband product sales  million was attributable to the calan acquisition 
the remaining million increase was from our existing product lines  primarily the cm  and the increasing acceptance of these products within the cable broadband industry 
during  sales decreased million or in north america  million or in europe africa middle east  million or in asia pacific  and million or in latin america compared to the decrease in north american sales during was due to decreased sales of our wireline access  fiber optics  and signaling products 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in the sales of our cable broadband products 
of the growth in our north american cable broadband product sales  of the increase in over relates to products from the calan business acquired during the first quarter of the decreases in our north american sales were primarily the result of decreased capital spending by our telecommunications customers 
in addition  beginning largely in  some dsl providers encouraged customer self installation and reported that up to of their customers perform self installation successfully 
the self installation procedure reduces the need for technicians to test for dsl service  reducing the demand for our dsl wireline access products  under the self installation model  our customers use our equipment primarily for troubleshooting and not for routine installations 
international sales  including north american sales in canada  decreased to million  or of net sales  in  from million  or of net sales  in the decrease in international sales is primarily due to decreased sales of our wireline access product lines and our fiber optics products 
cost of sales 
cost of sales decreased  to million in from million in this decrease is primarily due to the decrease in net sales volumes 
cost of sales represented and of net sales in and  respectively 
research and development 
research and development expenses decreased  to million in from million in this decrease is primarily due to decreased payroll dedicated to research and development activities 
research and development expenses represented of net sales in and of net sales in the increase as a percentage of net sales is primarily due to product sales decreasing more rapidly than research and development expenditures  as we continued to invest in product development and expansion of our product lines 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses decreased  to million in from million in this decrease is primarily due to reductions in advertising and printing expenses  headcount reductions among selling and marketing personnel  and reduced commission expenses 
commission expenses decreased primarily due to the decrease in our sales  particularly north american sales  on which we make the preponderance of our commission payments 
selling and marketing expenses represented of net sales in and of net sales in the increase as a percentage of net sales in is primarily due to product sales decreasing more rapidly than selling and marketing expenditures and our efforts to continue to develop markets for and sell our products 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses decreased  to million in from million in this decrease is primarily due to a million decrease in amortization of purchased intangible assets resulting from the cessation of amortization of goodwill related to acquisitions beginning on january  the remaining million of the decrease is primarily due to cost reduction measures 
general and administrative expenses represented of net sales in and of net sales in 
table of contents other income  net 
other income  net decreased to million in from million in this decrease resulted primarily from a decrease in interest income as our cash  cash equivalents  and investments in marketable securities balances declined and interest rates fell 
income tax expense benefit 
we recorded an income tax benefit of million in and income tax expense of million in our effective income tax rates were in and in our effective tax rate was lower during than because during our research and development tax credit  foreign sales corporation fsc tax benefit  and tax exempt interest were larger in proportion to our statutory taxes than they were during liquidity and capital resources cash requirements and capital resources as of december  and  we had working capital of million and million  respectively  and cash and cash equivalents of million and million  respectively 
at december   we also had million in investments in marketable securities that were classified as current assets on our balance sheet 
these investments have matured  and as explained in the notes to our december  consolidated financial statements  our million investment in marketable securities at december  consisted entirely of equity securities of top union electronics corp  a taiwan roc company 
at december   these securities were reported at historical cost and classified with other assets on our balance sheet 
during the quarter ended june   these securities became listed on the gretai securities market  taiwan s over the counter exchange 
as a result  we reclassified them to marketable securities and revalued them to their fair value  as required for available for sale securities 
we do not consider this to be a liquid investment  and accordingly classify it as a non current asset 
we have generated positive cash flows from our operating activities every year since we believe that current cash balances and future cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for our operations  complete needed business projects  achieve our plans and objectives  meet financial commitments  meet working capital requirements  make capital expenditures  and fund other activities well beyond the next months 
however  a large acquisition of complementary businesses  products  or technologies  or material joint ventures could require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing 
we cannot assure you that such additional financing would be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
however  no such activities are anticipated at this time and our present levels of debt and other future commitments are small compared to our present cash balances  so we presently anticipate that our most significant cash requirements during at least the next months will be for our normal research and development  selling and marketing  and production activities 
furthermore  we are unaware of any known material trends or uncertainties that may require us to make cash management decisions that will impair our short or long term operating capabilities 
sources and uses of cash in general  we have financed our operations and capital expenditures primarily using cash flows generated by our operating activities 
in addition  in july we received net proceeds of million from an initial public offering of our common stock 
we have since expended these proceeds  mainly to acquire complementary businesses and to construct our corporate headquarters in san jose  california 
we foresee relying on cash flows from our operating activities and existing cash resources to fund our business activities during at least the next months  and we do not expect to rely on any significant financing activities during that time 
cash provided by operating activities was million in  million in  and million in operating cash flows increased during compared to primarily due to changes in non cash items affecting 
table of contents our net income year over year and changes in certain of our current assets and liabilities  including a lower employment retention bonus payment to the vice president and general manager of our cable broadband operation and the collection during of income taxes receivable 
these items were partially offset by a reduction in deferred revenue 
operating cash flows decreased during compared to primarily because of our net loss in furthermore  although we continued to have net reductions in inventory purchases during  the amount of these net reductions was significantly less than during  and our cash generated from collecting accounts receivable decreased during compared to the factors decreasing operating cash flow during were partially offset by a reduction in payments on our accounts payable and accrued expenses 
in general  our ability to continue to generate positive cash flows from operations will depend on our ability to generate and collect the cash from future sales  while maintaining a cost structure lower than those sales amounts 
therefore  sales volume is by far the most significant uncertainty in our ability to generate cash flow from operations 
we believe that our business strategies will allow us to generate future sales that  combined with our existing cash and cash equivalents  will be sufficient to fund our business well beyond the next months 
cash used in investing activities was million in  million in  and million in the million decrease in net cash used in investing activities during from is primarily due to a decrease in business acquisition related expenditures and due to a non recurring event  a loan made to our chief executive officer in and repaid in offsetting these reductions was a decrease in proceeds from the sale of marketable securities 
the million decrease in net cash used in investing activities during from is primarily due to decreased amounts paid for business acquisitions and decreased capital expenditures 
capital expenditures during included million for land and million for construction of our facility in san jose  california  and we also reduced our expenditures on equipment and other capital assets during offsetting those reductions in cash flows used in investing activities was the loan made to our chief executive officer in early as of december   we had no plans for large capital expenditures outside the usual course of those needed for our ongoing production  research and development  and selling and marketing activities 
cash used in financing activities was million in and million in cash provided by financing activities was million in the decrease in cash used in financing activities during from is primarily due to the completion of a stock repurchase program during this decrease was partially offset by a million dividend paid to our stockholders during  while no dividend was paid during in january  our board of directors announced plans to institute annual dividend payments  with the year dividend being million 
this dividend was paid to stockholders in february the increase in net cash used in financing activities during from is primarily due to increased repurchases of our common stock and a reduction in proceeds from common stock issued under our employee stock purchase plan 
during  we completed the repurchases of our stock under a plan approved by the board of directors in under this plan  a total of million shares have been repurchased since for total cash expended of million 
our outstanding debt at december  consisted primarily of a million loan from the italian government for research and development use that is payable over a period of eight years through semi annual payments starting in the second half of and ending in and nine notes payable related to acquisitions totaling million that are being paid in quarterly installments ending in we have not used off balance sheet financing arrangements  issued or purchased derivative instruments linked to our stock  or used our stock as a form of liquidity 
we do not believe that there are any known or reasonably likely changes in credit ratings or ratings outlook or an inability to achieve such changes which would have any significant impact on our operations 
we are not subject to any debt covenants that we believe might have a material impact on our business 
debt instruments  guarantees  and related covenants we have low levels of debt  and our operating  financing  and investing activities are not subject to any significant constraints related to outstanding debt  guarantees  or other contingent obligations 
we are not  and during at least the 
table of contents next months are not reasonably likely to be  in breach of debt covenants 
we are not subject to any significant debt covenants that may limit our ability to borrow additional funds or issue equity securities 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates  assumptions  and judgments that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable 
although these estimates are based on our present best knowledge of the future impact on the company of current events and actions  actual results may differ from these estimates  assumptions  and judgments 
we consider critical those accounting policies that require our most subjective or complex judgments  which often result from a need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain  and that are among the most important of our accounting policies to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
these critical accounting policies are the determination of our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  valuation of excess and obsolete inventory  valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets  accounting for the liability for product warranties  deferred income tax assets and liabilities  and revenue recognition 
allowance for doubtful accounts receivable we determine our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable by making our best estimate considering our historical accounts receivable collection experience and the information that we have about the current status of our accounts receivable balances 
if future conditions cause our collection experience to change or if we later obtain different information about the status of any or all of our accounts receivable  additional allowances for doubtful accounts receivable may be required 
we charge provisions for doubtful accounts receivable to general and administrative expenses on our statement of operations 
valuation of excess and obsolete inventory we determine the valuation of excess and obsolete inventory by making our best estimate considering the current quantities of inventory on hand and our forecast of the need for this inventory to support future sales of our products 
we often have limited information on which to base our forecasts  and if future sales differ from these forecasts  the valuation of excess and obsolete inventory may change 
we charge provisions for excess and obsolete inventory to cost of sales on our statement of operations 
valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets we evaluate the valuation of goodwill in the manner prescribed by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
as required by sfas no 
 we test goodwill for impairment annually  during our fourth fiscal quarter 
we would also test goodwill for impairment if certain events or changes in circumstances stipulated by sfas no 
were to occur 
sfas no 
prescribes a two step process for the impairment testing of goodwill 
the first screens for impairment by comparing the fair value of our reporting unit  which we consider to be the market capitalization of our entire telecommunications testing equipment business  to its carrying value 
if the carrying value were to exceed the fair value  the second phase of the process would occur 
in the second phase  we would recognize an impairment for the excess of the carrying value  if any  of our goodwill over its implied fair value 
the implied fair value of our goodwill is the excess of our reporting unit s total fair value over the combined net fair values of its individual assets and liabilities 
based on the annual test for impairment performed during our fourth 
table of contents fiscal quarter  goodwill was determined not to be impaired  and no subsequent indicators of impairment have been noted 
we evaluate the valuation of intangible assets other than goodwill in the manner prescribed by sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
as required by that standard  we monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate that the carrying amount of an intangible asset may not be recoverable 
these events and circumstances include a significant change in how we use the asset  significant changes in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the asset s value  and current period operating or cash flow losses combined with a history of such losses or a forecast of continuing losses associated with the use of the asset 
if such an event or change in circumstances were to occur  we would assess the recoverability of the intangible asset by determining whether its carrying value would be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows 
if the carrying value of the asset were to exceed the undiscounted expected future cash flows  we would recognize an impairment for the excess of the carrying value over the asset s fair value 
product warranties we offer a three year warranty covering parts and labor on our wireline access products and fiber optic products sold in the united states  and generally offer a one year warranty covering parts and labor for our products sold in all other countries  with the option to purchase a two year extended warranty 
our cable broadband and signaling products are covered by a one year warranty 
we are also subject to laws and regulations in the various countries in which we sell regarding vendor obligations to ensure product performance 
at the time we recognize revenue from a product s sale  we determine the reserve for the future cost of meeting our obligations under the standard warranties and product performance laws and regulations by considering our historical experience with the costs of meeting such obligations 
if the future costs of meeting these obligations differ from our historical experience  additional reserves for warranty obligations may be required 
we charge provisions for future warranty costs to cost of sales on our statement of operations 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and for the future tax consequences attributable to operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
in assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
the ultimate realization of certain deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the related temporary differences become deductible 
if we obtain information that causes our forecast of future taxable income to change or if taxable income differs from our forecast  we may have to revise the carrying value of our deferred tax assets  which would affect our net income in the period in which the change occurs 
the ultimate realization of certain other deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to carry forward or back operating losses and tax credits 
if changes in the tax laws occur that inhibit our ability to carry forward or back operating losses or tax credits  we will recognize the effect on our deferred tax assets in the results of operations of the period that includes the enactment date of the change 
furthermore  we measure our deferred tax assets and liabilities using the enacted tax laws expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
if tax laws change  we will recognize the effect on our deferred tax assets and liabilities in the results of operations of the period that includes the enactment date of the change 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from a customer order when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 

table of contents for product sales  we consider delivery to have occurred when title and risk of loss have been transferred to the customer  which is usually at the time that the product has been picked up by a common carrier 
for services  we consider delivery to have occurred once the service has been provided 
we use objective evidence of fair value to allocate revenue to elements in multiple element arrangements and recognize revenue when the criteria for revenue recognition have been met for each element 
in the absence of objective evidence of fair value of a delivered element  we allocate revenue to the fair value of the undelivered elements and the residual revenue to the delivered elements 
the price charged when an element is sold separately generally determines fair value 
when the arrangement with the customer includes future obligations or obtaining customer acceptance  we recognize revenue when those obligations have been met or customer acceptance has been received 
we defer revenue from services and support provided under our warranty programs and recognizes it on a straight line basis over the warranty period 
deferred revenue represents amounts received from customers in advance of services and support to be provided and amounts received prior to customer acceptance 
provisions are recorded at the time of sale for estimated product returns  standard warranty obligations  and customer support 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our current or future financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  or capital resources 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes  as of december   the timing of future cash payments due under certain contractual obligations in thousands payments due in total less than year years years more than years borrowings and notes payable capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations total risk factors affecting future operating results quarterly fluctuations because our quarterly operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and are likely to fluctuate significantly in the future  our stock price may be volatile 
in the past  we have experienced significant fluctuations in our quarterly results due to a number of factors 
in the future  our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly and may be difficult to predict given the nature of our business 
many factors could cause our operating results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter  including the following the size and timing of orders from our customers  which may be exacerbated by the increased length and unpredictability of our customers buying patterns  and limitations on our ability to ship these orders on a timely basis  the degree to which our customers have allocated and spent their yearly budgets  
table of contents the uneven pace of technological innovation  the development of products responding to these technological innovations by us and our competitors  and customer acceptance of these products and innovations  the varied degree of price  product  and technology competition  and our customers and competitors responses to these changes  the relative percentages of our products sold domestically and internationally  the mix of the products we sell and the varied margins associated with these products  the timing of our customers budget processes  and economic downturns reducing demand for telecommunication and cable equipment and services 
the factors listed above may affect our business and stock price in several ways 
given our high fixed costs from overhead  research and development  and advertising and marketing  and other activities necessary to run our business  if our net sales are below our expectations in any quarter  we may not be able to adjust spending accordingly 
for example  during our net sales declined from  but our operating expenses only declined  mainly because of the relatively high fixed costs in our operations 
our stock price may decline and may be volatile if our future sales and operating costs continue to reflect historical volatility patterns 
furthermore  the above factors  taken together may make it more difficult for us to issue additional equity in the future or raise debt financing to fund future acquisitions and accelerate growth 
generally declining sales our sales have generally decreased over the last three years and we are experiencing increased difficulty predicting future operating results 
although  due to unfavorable economic and market conditions over the past three years  our sales over the last three year period have generally declined or been flat  we have shown sequential quarter and year over year increases in the last two quarters of nonetheless  we believe that it may be too early to predict an upward trend in sales 
as a result  we are unable to predict future sales accurately  and we are currently unable to provide long term guidance for future financial performance 
the conditions contributing to this difficulty include the following uncertainty regarding the capital spending plans of the major telecommunications and cable carriers upon whom we depend for sales  the telecommunications and cable carriers current limited access to capital required for expansion  more limited near term sales visibility  and general market and economic uncertainty 
based on these and other factors  many of our major customers have reduced  modified  cancelled  or rescheduled orders for our products and have expressed uncertainty as to their future requirements 
economic downturn our operating results and financial condition could continue to be harmed if the telecommunications and cable broadband industries remain over supplied 
the current economic downturn has resulted in reduced purchasing and capital spending in the telecommunications and cable broadband industries  which have been in a downward cycle characterized by diminished product demand  excess manufacturing capacity  and the increasing erosion of average selling prices 
the downturn has adversely affected the businesses and cash flows of many of our customers and has even caused some of them to file for bankruptcy 
we are uncertain how long the current downturn will last 
continuation of the downturn or any further decline in our customers markets or in general economic conditions would likely result in a further reduction in demand for our products and services and also would further limit our customers ability to pay for the 
table of contents products that they buy from us 
all of these circumstances could harm our consolidated financial position  results of operations  cash flows  and stock price and could hinder our ability to reach our goals of restoring long term profitability and growth 
long term impact of cost controls the actions we have taken and may take in response to the recent slowdown in demand for our products and services could have long term adverse effects on our business 
over the past three years  our business generally has experienced lower revenues due to decreased or cancelled customer orders 
to scale back our operations and to reduce our expenses in response to this decreased demand for our products and services and lower revenue  we have reduced portions of our workforce  restricted hiring  reduced some employees salaries  restricted pay increases  and reduced discretionary spending 
there are several risks inherent in our efforts to transition to a reduced cost structure 
these include the risk that we will not be able to reduce expenditures quickly enough and sustain them at a level necessary to restore profitability  and that we may have to undertake further restructuring initiatives that would entail additional charges 
in addition  there is the risk that cost cutting initiatives will impair our future ability to develop and market products effectively  to manage and control our business  and to remain competitive 
each of the above measures could have long term effects on our business by reducing our pool of technical talent  decreasing or slowing improvements in our products  making it more difficult for us to respond to customers  limiting our ability to increase production quickly if and when the demand for our products increases  and limiting our ability to hire and retain key personnel 
these circumstances could cause our earnings to be lower than they otherwise might be 
dependence on wireline access products a significant portion of our sales have been from our wireline access products  which makes our future sales and overall business vulnerable to product obsolescence and technological change 
sales of our dsl and other wireline access products represented approximately of our net sales during and during currently  our dsl products are primarily used by a limited number of incumbent local exchange carriers  including the regional bell operating companies  and competitive local exchange carriers who offer dsl services 
these parties  and other internet service providers and users  are continuously evaluating alternative high speed data access technologies  including cable modems  fiber optics  wireless technology  and satellite technologies  and may at any time adopt these competing technologies 
these competing technologies may ultimately prove to be superior to dsl services and reduce or eliminate the demand for our dsl products 
manufacturing capacity if demand for our products does not match our manufacturing capacity  our earnings may suffer 
because we cannot immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to rapidly changing market conditions  when demand does not meet our expectations  our manufacturing capacity exceeds our production requirements  and profitability may decline 
conversely  if during a market upturn we cannot increase our manufacturing capacity to meet product demand  we will not be able to fulfill orders in a timely manner  which in turn may have a negative effect on our earnings and overall business 
risks of the telecommunications industry we face several risks related to the telecommunications industry  including the possible effects of its unpredictable growth or decline  the possible effects of consolidation among our principal customers  and the risk that deregulation will slow 
after the passage of the telecommunications act of  the telecommunications industry experienced rapid growth 
the growth led to great innovations in technology  intense competition  short product life cycles  and  to some extent  regulatory uncertainty inside and outside the united states 
however  the course of the development of the 
table of contents telecommunications industry is difficult to predict 
companies operating in this industry have a difficult time forecasting future trends and developments and forecasting customer acceptance of competing technologies 
one possible effect of this uncertainty is that there is  and may continue to be  a delay or a reduction in these companies investment in their business and purchase of related equipment  such as our products  and a reduction in their and our access to capital 
in addition  deregulation may result in a delay or a reduction in the procurement cycle because of the general uncertainty involved with the transition period of businesses 
the growth that occurred after the passage of the telecommunications act of has slowed dramatically  and it is unknown whether or when it will resume 
this slowdown has resulted in reduced investment in the telecommunications industry in general and delayed purchase orders for service verification equipment such as our products in particular 
it is not possible to predict whether this slowdown will be temporary or sustained 
in addition  the telecommunications industry has been experiencing consolidation among its primary participants  such as incumbent local exchange carriers and competitive local exchange carriers  several of whom are our primary customers 
for example  in recent years  gte and bell atlantic  both of which were customers of ours  merged to create verizon communications inc continued consolidation may cause delay or cancellation of orders for our products 
the consolidation of our customers will likely provide them with greater negotiating leverage with us and may lead them to pressure us to lower the prices of our products 
cable broadband industry health many of the major companies in the cable broadband industry have debt and profitability problems  which are expected to negatively impact our cable equipment sales 
the cable broadband industry has taken on significant debt as companies aggressively consolidated and built up impressive new digital networks to allow them to provide better picture quality  internet access  and voice telephony 
profits have declined during the last few years within the industry  however 
as a result  many cable companies may reduce their capital expenditures and or hiring  both of which could adversely impact our cable business more than we now expect 
during  we saw evidence of such a slowdown  as our sales of cable broadband products decreased or million from levels 
customer concentration a limited number of customers account for a high percentage of our net sales  and any adverse factor affecting these customers or our relationship with these customers could cause our net sales to decrease 
our customer base is concentrated  and a relatively small number of companies have accounted for a large percentage of our net sales 
net sales from our top five customers represented approximately of total net sales in and in in general  our customers are not subject to long term supply contracts with us and are not obligated to purchase a specific amount of products from us or to provide us with binding forecasts of purchases for any period 
the loss of a major customer or the reduction  delay  or cancellation of orders from one or more of our significant customers could cause our net sales and  therefore  profits to decline 
in addition  many of our customers are able to exert substantial negotiating leverage over us 
as a result  they may cause us to lower our prices to them  and they may successfully negotiate other terms and provisions that may negatively affect our business and profits 
goodwill valuation our financial results could be materially and adversely affected if it is determined that the book value of goodwill is higher than fair value 
our balance sheet at december  includes an amount designated as goodwill that represents approximately of assets and of stockholders equity 
goodwill arises when an acquirer pays more for a business than the fair value of the acquired tangible and separately measurable intangible net assets 
under accounting 
table of contents pronouncement sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  beginning in january  the amortization of goodwill has been replaced with an impairment test  which requires that we compare the fair value of goodwill to its book value at least annually  and more frequently if circumstances indicate a possible impairment 
our impairment test is based on a market capitalization analysis 
accordingly  if our market capitalization were to diminish significantly  the book value of goodwill could be higher than the fair value  and we would need to record a non cash impairment charge for the difference  which could materially and adversely affect our net income or loss 
product development if we are unable to develop new products successfully and enhance our existing products  our future success may be threatened 
the market for our products is characterized by rapid technological advances  changes in customer requirements and preferences  evolving industry and customer specific protocol standards  and frequent new product enhancements and introductions 
our existing products and our products currently under development could be rendered obsolete by the introduction of products involving competing technologies  by the evolution of alternative technologies or new industry protocol standards  or by rival products of our competitors 
these market conditions are more complex and challenging because of the high degree to which the telecommunications industry is fragmented 
we believe our future success will depend  in part  upon our ability  on a timely and cost effective basis  to continue to do the following anticipate and respond to varied and rapidly changing customer preferences and requirements  a process made more challenging by our customers buying patterns  anticipate and develop new products and solutions for networks based on emerging technologies  such as the asynchronous transfer mode protocol that packs digital information into cells to be routed across a network  and internet telephony  which comprises voice  video  image  and data across the internet  that are likely to be characterized by continuing technological developments  evolving industry standards  and changing customer requirements  invest in research and development to enhance our existing products and to introduce new verification and diagnostic products for the telecommunications  internet  cable network  and other markets  and support our products by investing in effective advertising  marketing  and customer support 
we cannot ensure that we will accomplish these objectives  and our failure to do so could have a material adverse impact on our market share  business  and financial results 
furthermore  our expenditures devoted to research and development may be considered high for our level of sales 
if these efforts do not result in the development of products that generate strong sales for us or if we do not continue to reduce these expenditures  our profit levels will not return to their desired levels 
if we reduce this spending  we may not be able to develop needed new products  which could negatively impact our sources of new revenues 
sales implementation cycles the length and unpredictability of the sales and implementation cycles for our products makes it difficult to forecast revenues 
sales of our products often entail an extended decision making process on the part of prospective customers 
we frequently experience delays following initial contact with a prospective customer and expend substantial funds and management effort pursuing these sales 
our ability to forecast the timing and amount of specific sales is therefore limited 
as a result  the uneven buying patterns of our customers may cause fluctuations in our operating results  which could cause our stock price to decline 

table of contents other sources of delays that lead to long sales cycles  or even a sales loss  include current and potential customers internal budgeting procedures  internal approval and contracting procedures  procurement practices  and testing and acceptance processes 
recently  our customers budgeting procedures have lengthened 
the sales cycle for larger deployments now typically ranges from six to twenty four months 
the deferral or loss of one or more significant sales could significantly affect our operating results  especially if there are significant selling and marketing expenses associated with the deferred or lost sales 
managing growth and slowdowns we may have difficulty managing expansions and contractions in our operations  which could reduce our chances of maintaining or restoring our profitability 
we experienced rapid growth in revenues and in our business during and followed by significant slowdowns in   and that have placed  and may continue to place  a significant strain on our management and operations 
for example  our revenues increased to million in from million in then revenues fell to million in and to million in  and then increased slightly to million in as a result of our historical growth and potential future growth or slowdowns  we face several risks  including the following the need to improve our operational  financial  management  informational  and control systems  the need to hire  train  and retain highly skilled personnel  and the challenge to manage expense reductions without impacting development strategies or our long term goals 
we cannot ensure that we will be able to successfully manage growth or slowdowns successfully or profitably 
acquisitions we have acquired multiple companies and lines of business  and we may pursue additional acquisitions in the future 
these activities involve numerous risks  including the use of cash  acquired intangible assets  and the diversion of management attention 
we have acquired multiple companies and lines of business 
as a result of these acquisitions  we face numerous risks  including the following integrating the existing management  sales force  technicians  and other personnel into one culture and business  integrating manufacturing  administrative  and management information and other control systems into our existing systems  developing and implementing an integrated business strategy over what had previously been independent companies  developing compatible or complementary products and technologies from previously independent operations  and pre acquisition liabilities associated with the companies or intellectual property acquired  or both 
the risks stated above are made more difficult because most of the companies we have acquired are located outside of the united states 
in addition  if we make future acquisitions  these risks will be exacerbated by the need to integrate additional operations at a time when we may not have fully integrated all of our previous acquisitions 
if we pursue additional acquisitions  we will face similar risks as those outlined above and additional risks  including the following the diversion of our management s attention and the expense of identifying and pursuing suitable acquisition candidates  whether or not consummated  
table of contents negotiating and closing these transactions  the possible need to fund these acquisitions by dilutive issuances of equity securities or by incurring debt  and the potential negative effect on our financial statements from an increase in other intangibles  write off of research and development costs  and high costs and expenses from completing acquisitions 
we cannot ensure that we will locate suitable acquisition candidates or that  if we do  we will be able to acquire them and then integrate them effectively  efficiently  and successfully into our business 
competition competition could reduce our market share and decrease our net sales 
the market for our products is fragmented and intensely competitive  both inside and outside the united states  and is subject to rapid technological change  evolving industry standards  regulatory developments  and varied and changing customer preferences and requirements 
we compete with a number of united states and international suppliers that vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the products and services offered 
the following table sets forth our principal competitors in each of our product categories 
product category principal competitors wireline access m dynatel  acterna corporation  agilent technologies  inc  consultronics  fluke corporation  trend communications fiber optics acterna corporation  agilent technologies  inc  digital lightwave  inc  exfo electro optical engineering inc  nettest  trend communications cable tv acterna corporation  agilent technologies  inc  trilithic  inc 
signaling agilent technologies  inc  inet technologies  inc  nettest many of these competitors have longer operating histories  larger installed customer bases  longer relationships with customers  wider name recognition and product offerings  and greater financial  technical  marketing  customer service  and other resources than we have 
we expect that as our industry and markets evolve new competitors or alliances among competitors with existing and new technologies may emerge and acquire significant market share 
we anticipate that competition in our markets will increase  and we will face continued threats to our market share and price pressure on our products 
also  over time  our profitability  if any  may decrease 
in addition  it is difficult to assess accurately the market share of our products or of sunrise overall because of the high degree of fragmentation in the market for service verification equipment 
as a result  it may be difficult for us to forecast accurately trends in the market  which of our products will be the most competitive over the longer term  and therefore  what is the best use of our cash and human and other forms of capital 
dependence on key employees if one or more of our senior managers were to leave  we could experience difficulty in replacing them and our operating results could suffer 
our success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service and performance of a relatively small number of key senior management  technical  sales  and marketing personnel 
in particular  the loss of either of two of our founders  paul ker chin chang or paul a 
marshall  would likely harm our business 
neither of these individuals is bound by an employment agreement with us  and we do not carry key man life insurance 
if any of our senior managers were to leave sunrise  we would need to devote substantial resources and management attention to replace them 
as a result  management attention may be diverted from managing our business  and we may need to pay higher compensation to replace these employees 

table of contents dependence on sole and single source suppliers because we depend on a limited number of suppliers and some sole and single source suppliers that are not bound by long term contracts  our future supply of parts is uncertain 
we purchase many key parts  such as microprocessors  field programmable gate arrays  bus interface chips  optical components  and oscillators  from single source or sole suppliers  and we license certain software from third parties 
we rely exclusively on third party subcontractors to manufacture some sub assemblies  and we have retained  from time to time  third party design services in the development of our products 
we do not have long term supply agreements with these vendors 
in general  we make advance purchases of some products and components to help to ensure an adequate supply 
in the past  we have experienced supply problems as a result of financial or operating difficulties of our suppliers  shortages  and discontinuations resulting from component obsolescence or other shortages or allocations by suppliers 
our reliance on these third parties involves a number of risks  including the following the unavailability of critical products and components on a timely basis  on commercially reasonable terms  or at all  the unavailability of products or software licenses  resulting in the need to qualify new or alternative products or develop or license new software for our use and or to reconfigure our products and manufacturing process  which could be lengthy and expensive  the likelihood that  if these products are not available  we would suffer an interruption in the manufacture and shipment of our products until the products or alternatives become available  reduced control over product quality and cost  risks that are exacerbated by the need to respond  at times  to unanticipated changes and increases in customer orders  the unavailability of  or interruption in  access to some process technologies  and exposure to the financial problems and stability of our suppliers 
in addition  the purchase of these components on a sole source basis subjects us to risks of price increases and potential quality assurance problems 
this dependence magnifies the risk that we may not be able to ship our products on a timely basis to satisfy customers orders 
we cannot ensure that one or more of these factors will not cause delays or reductions in product shipments or increases in product costs  which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business 
risks of international operations our plan to expand sales in international markets could lead to higher operating expenses and may subject us to unpredictable regulatory and political systems 
sales to customers located outside of the united states represented of our net sales in  in  and in  and we expect international revenues to continue to account for a significant percentage of net sales for the foreseeable future 
in addition  an important part of our strategy calls for further expansion into international markets 
as a result  we will face various risks relating to our international operations  including the following potentially higher operating expenses  resulting from the establishment of international offices  the hiring of additional and local personnel  and the localization and marketing of products for particular countries technologies  the need to establish relationships with government owned or subsidized telecommunications providers and with additional distributors  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and the risks of using hedging strategies to minimize our exposure to these fluctuations  
table of contents potentially adverse tax consequences related to acquisitions and operations  including the ability to claim goodwill deductions and a foreign tax credit against us federal income taxes  and possible disruptions to our customers  sales channels  sources of supply  or production facilities due to wars  terrorist acts  acts of protest or civil disobedience  or other conflicts between or within various nations and due to variations in crime rates and the rule of law between nations 
we cannot ensure that one or more of these factors will not materially and adversely affect our ability to expand into international markets or our revenues and profits 
in addition  the asia pacific and latin america regions have experienced instability in many of their economies and significant devaluations in local currencies 
of our sales in  of our sales in  and of our sales in were from customers located in these regions 
these instabilities may continue or worsen  which could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations 
if international revenues are not adequate to offset the additional expense of expanding international operations  our future growth and profitability could suffer 
operations in taiwan we rely on our subsidiary in taiwan to manufacture a substantial portion of our products  and our reputation and results of operations could be adversely affected if this subsidiary does not perform as we expect 
we produce a substantial portion of our products at our subsidiary in taiwan and plan to concentrate more of our production there in the future 
we depend on our subsidiary to produce a sufficient volume of our products in a timely fashion and at satisfactory quality levels 
if we fail to manage our subsidiary so that it produces quality products on time and in sufficient quantities  our reputation and results of operations could suffer 
in additions  we rely on our taiwan subsidiary to place orders with suppliers for the components they need to manufacture our products 
if they fail to place timely and sufficient orders with their suppliers  our results of operations could suffer 
the cost  quality  and availability of our taiwan operation is essential to the successful production and sale of our products 
our increasing reliance on this foreign subsidiary for manufacturing exposes us to risks that are not under our immediate control and which could negatively impact our results of operations 
for example  a recurrence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars outbreak that occurred in asia last year could result in quarantines or closure of our manufacturing operation or its suppliers 
in addition  transportation delays and interruptions  political and economic disruptions  the imposition of tariffs  quotas  or other import or export controls  changes in governmental policies and regulations  and natural disasters could also adversely impact our taiwan operation and negatively impact our results of operations 
see risk factors affecting future operating results dependence on sole and single source suppliers and risks of international operations for a discussion of risks associated with concentrating production activities at one facility that is outside the united states 
concentration of control our executive officers and directors retain significant control over us  which allows them to decide the outcome of matters submitted to stockholders for approval 
this influence may not be beneficial to all stockholders 
as of december   paul ker chin chang  paul a 
marshall  and robert c 
pfeiffer beneficially owned approximately   and  respectively  of our outstanding shares of common stock 
consequently  these three individuals  control approximately of our outstanding shares of common stock and to the extent they act together would be able to control the election of our directors and the approval of significant corporate transactions that must be submitted to a vote of stockholders 
in addition  mr 
chang  mr 
marshall  and mr 
pfeiffer constitute three of the six members of the board of directors and have significant influence in directing the actions taken by the board 
the interests of these persons may conflict with the interests of other stockholders  and the actions they take or approve may be contrary to those desired by other stockholders 
this concentration of ownership and control of the 
table of contents management and affairs of our company may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company that other stockholders may consider desirable 
potential product liability our products are complex  and our failure to detect errors and defects may subject us to costly repairs and product returns under warranty and product liability litigation 
our products are complex and may contain undetected defects or errors when first introduced or as enhancements are released 
these errors may occur despite our testing and may not be discovered until after a product has been shipped and used by our customers 
many of the products that we ship contain imperfections that we consider to be insignificant at the time of shipment 
we may misjudge the seriousness of a product imperfection and allow it to be shipped to our customers 
these risks are compounded by the fact that we offer many products with multiple hardware and software modifications  which makes it more difficult to ensure high standards of quality control in our manufacturing process 
the existence of these errors or defects could result in costly repairs and or returns of products under warranty and  more generally  in delayed market acceptance of the product or damage to our reputation and business 
in addition  the terms of our customer agreements and purchase orders which provide us with protection against unwarranted claims of product defects and errors may not protect us adequately from unwarranted claims against us  unfair verdicts if a claim were to go to trial  settlement of these kinds of claims  or future regulation or laws regarding our products 
our defense against such claims in the future  regardless of their merit  could result in substantial expense to us  diversion of management time and attention  and damage to our business reputation and our ability to retain existing customers or attract new customers 
intellectual property risks policing any unauthorized use of our intellectual property by third parties and defending any intellectual property infringement claims against us could be expensive and disrupt our business 
our intellectual property and proprietary technology is an important part of our business  and we depend on the development and use of various forms of intellectual property and proprietary technology 
as a result  we are subject to several related risks  including the risks of unauthorized use of our intellectual property and the costs of protecting our intellectual property 
much of our intellectual property and proprietary technology is not protected by patents 
if unauthorized persons were to copy  obtain  or otherwise misappropriate our intellectual property or proprietary technology without our approval  the value of our investment in research and development would decline  our reputation and brand could be diminished  and we would likely suffer a decline in revenue 
we believe these risks  which are present in any business in which intellectual property and proprietary technology play an important role  are exacerbated by the difficulty in finding unauthorized use of intellectual property in our business  the increasing incidence of patent infringement in our industry in general  and the difficulty of enforcing intellectual property rights in some foreign countries 
in addition  litigation has in the past been  and may in the future be  necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights 
this kind of litigation is time consuming and expensive to prosecute or resolve  and results in substantial diversion of management resources 
we cannot ensure that we will be successful in that litigation  that our intellectual property rights will be held valid and enforceable in any litigation  or that we will otherwise be able to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology 
in the future  we may receive notices from holders of patents that raise issues as to possible infringement by our products 
as the number of telecommunications test  measurement  and network management products increases and the functionality of these products further overlap  we believe that we may become subject to allegations of infringement given the nature of the telecommunications industry and the high incidence of these kinds of claims 
questions of 
table of contents infringement and the validity of patents in the field of telecommunications technologies involve highly technical and subjective analyses 
these kinds of proceedings are time consuming and expensive to defend or resolve  result in substantial diversion of management resources  cause product shipment delays  and could force us to enter into royalty or license agreements rather than dispute the merits of the proceeding initiated against us 
anti takeover provisions anti takeover provisions in our charter documents could prevent or delay a change of control and  as a result  negatively impact our stockholders 
some provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of discouraging  delaying  or preventing a change in control of our company or unsolicited acquisition proposals that a stockholder may consider favorable 
these provisions provide for the following authorizing the issuance of blank check preferred stock  a classified board of directors with staggered  three year terms  prohibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors  requiring super majority voting to effect certain amendments to our certificate of incorporation and by laws  limiting the persons who may call special meetings of stockholders  prohibiting stockholder action by written consent  and establishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon at stockholders meetings 
some provisions of delaware law and our stock incentive plans may also have the effect of discouraging  delaying  or preventing a change in control of our company or unsolicited acquisition proposals 
these provisions also could limit the price that some investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we sell our products in north america  asia  latin america  africa  the middle east  and europe and maintain operations in several different countries 
changes in currency exchange rates affect the valuation in our financial statements of the assets and liabilities of these operations 
we also have a small amount of sales denominated in euros and the canadian dollar  which are also affected by changes in currency exchange rates 
to hedge these risks  we have at certain times used derivative financial instruments 
however  as of december   we had no derivative financial instruments or other foreign exchange risk hedging devices 
with or without hedges  our financial results could be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates  although foreign exchange risks have not been material to our financial position or results of operations so far 
we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and changes in the market values of our investments 
our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we have not held derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we invest our excess cash in depository accounts with financial institutions  in debt instruments of united states governmental agencies  and in debt instruments of high quality corporate issuers  and  by policy  we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we protect and preserve our invested funds by limiting default  market  and reinvestment risk through portfolio diversification and review of the financial stability of the institutions with which we deposit funds and from whom we purchase debt instruments 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating 
table of contents rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates  or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
because our investment policy restricts us to conservative  interest bearing investments and because our business strategy does not rely on generating material returns from our investment portfolio  we do not expect our market risk exposure on our investment portfolio to be material
