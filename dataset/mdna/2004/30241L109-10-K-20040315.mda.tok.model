tems  sems and sims systems collectively comprise our electron optics segment products 
fibs  snp products and dualbeam products collectively comprise our microelectronics segment products 
summary of operations we focused on growing our revenues and improving our product mix during the fourth quarter of was the largest revenue quarter in our history 
we introduced seven new products during and completed three acquisitions to strengthen our competitive position 
was also characterized by significant fluctuations in the united states dollar against foreign currencies  especially the euro 
we mitigated the effects of currency fluctuations by instituting a hedging program that not only hedged specific cash  receivables and payables balances  but also certain manufacturing and operating expenses in europe 
in addition  we continued to transition certain manufacturing and other operations and the related supply chains to lower cost countries  including to our manufacturing site in brno 
acquisitions in on july   we purchased the cad navigation and yield management software product lines of the egsoft division egsoft of electroglas  inc electroglas 
we paid electroglas million and assumed certain liabilities in exchange for the product lines 
also on july   we purchased substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of lmc instrument corp  dba revise revise  a developer and manufacturer of laser based tools for the microelectronics and micro machining industries 
the purchase price was million 
on november   we purchased emispec systems  inc emispec  a developer of software for tem automation and tomography  to further accelerate our tem software development capabilities 
we paid million and assumed certain liabilities in exchange for existing technology and certain other assets 
for additional information regarding these acquisitions  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this report

results of operations the following table sets forth our statement of operations data as a percentage of net sales 
year ended december  net sales cost of sales gross profit research and development selling  general and administrative merger costs amortization of purchased technology purchased in process research and development restructuring and reorganization costs operating income other expense  net income before income taxes income tax expense net income amounts may not add due to rounding 
net sales increased to million in compared to million in this increase primarily resulted from increases in sales from our microelectronics and service segments 
sales in the asian pacific and european regions were also stronger in compared to net sales decreased to million in compared to million in this decrease primarily resulted from decreased sales in our microelectronics and components segments 
sales in the north american and european regions were also weaker in compared to net sales by segment net sales include sales in our microelectronics  electron optics  components and service segments 
sales by segment in thousands and as a percentage of total sales were as follows year ended december  microelectronics    electron optics    components    service    microelectronics the net increase in microelectronics sales in compared to was primarily a result of increased demand for new products  combined with some improvement in demand for existing products directed at the semiconductor and data storage equipment business 
total unit shipments increased in compared to the increased demand for new products in was due primarily to strong demand for our small stage dualbeam systems and our metrology systems introduced in mid our small dualbeam systems include the nova product and the quanta d product and our metrology systems include the certus d product  a dualbeam product used for data storage metrology 
our new small dualbeam products  which have a lower price point than our other dual beam products  have made it possible for certain customers to buy a dualbeam product rather than one of our single beam sem products 
also included in microelectronics sales is million of sales resulting from our acquisition of egsoft on july  the decrease in microelectronics sales in compared to was attributable to global economic weakness in the semiconductor and data storage markets and resulting decreased demand for our products 
our sales to the data storage market declined significantly in due to market saturation of the technology offered by our products  which is currently being replaced with new products 
in  we shipped fewer systems than in  but the product mix remained about the same in as in electron optics the decrease in electron optics sales in compared to was primarily a result of decreased volumes of both tem and sem units and continued pricing pressures from competition in the market place  partially offset by favorable currency exchange gains totaling approximately million 
total electron optics unit shipments decreased by in compared to shifts in product mix towards our lower price point and lower margin units  such as sems  negatively affected our sales in compared to as did the shift from possible sem sales to our new small dualbeam microelectronics products 
the slight decrease in electron optics sales in compared to was primarily a result of price pressure in the market place and a decrease in volume  partially offset by a positive currency impact 
total electron optics unit shipments decreased by in compared to tem sales for decreased million  or  on flat unit shipments because of pricing pressure 
sales of our sem products increased million  or  in compared to due to continued strong demand for our quanta sem products 
sales of our sims system product began in and totaled million 
components our component sales  which comprise only approximately to of our net sales  tend to follow the cyclical pattern of the semiconductor equipment business  which has experienced a significant downturn since our component sales were relatively flat in as compared to  but did increase sequentially in each quarter of service service sales are driven by the size of our installed base and the percentage of our installed base that is more than one year old  as our warranty period is typically for one year 
systems sold to customers that come to the end of their warranty periods lead to a related increase in service contracts 
service contracts in the semiconductor and data storage markets often include increased support and more rapid response times  which carry higher prices  contributing to the overall increase in service revenue in compared to and in compared to sales by geographic region a significant portion of our revenue has been derived from customers outside of the united states  and we expect this to continue 
the following table shows our net sales by geographic location dollars in thousands year ended december  north america    europe    asian pacific region    the decrease in net sales from the north american region in compared to was due to market uncertainty as well as transition for new product introductions 
the semiconductor and data storage markets are shifting to more overseas production and investment  which has shifted sales out of north america and into europe and the asian pacific region 
many united states based companies are purchasing equipment for delivery overseas 
however  the north american economic climate  and the semiconductor industry in particular  did show signs of improvement in the second half of the north american region was also positively affected in by million of sales resulting from the acquisition of egsoft on july  in the european region in  we experienced significant sales to adopters of our new small dualbeam product nova 
an overall strengthening of european currencies against the united states dollar had an approximately million positive impact on net sales in was also positively affected by two large microelectronics equipment sales of approximately million each for for defect analysis and mask repair 
the increase in the asian pacific region in compared to was primarily due to an increase in sales in japan of microelectronics products  especially small dualbeam units 
we also realized improved sales in china  which included sales of sem and tem electron optics products and certain microelectronic products for the semiconductor industry 
net sales decreased in compared to across all regions 
in north america  the decreased sales were due to depressed demand in the semiconductor and data storage markets 
in europe  the decreased sales were due to decreased demand in the semiconductor market combined with overall price pressure  and were partially offset by increased demand in the industry and institute markets 
sales by market sales by market and as a percentage of total sales were as follows dollars in thousands year ended december  semiconductor    data storage    industry and institute    semiconductor sales in increased by over  primarily due to strength in the laboratory area of this sector in the second half of  where we benefited from the general industry upturn  as well as from sales of our new small dualbeam products 
during  we also shipped several high end defect analysis systems as part of our strategy to move our defect analysis products from the laboratories into production environments 
semiconductor sales in declined by as compared to  which was attributable to global economic weakness in the semiconductor industry 
data storage sales in increased by over primarily due to increased sales of our new certus tool in second half of the certus tool offers new metrology capability and improved performance over the prior generation of our data storage metrology tool 
we expect that data storage customers will find these enhancements compelling as they move towards ever smaller product geometries and new magnetic recording head architectures 
data storage sales in declined by as compared to  as customers utilized tools purchased for the then current technology node 
industry and institute sales declined by in compared to  due to pricing pressure 
customers in this market include universities  research institutes and corporate research and development labs 
in addition  this market serves life sciences customers who are utilizing pathology and drug research applications of our tems and sems 
within the industry and institute market  we see opportunity for increased sales related to applications in life sciences and nanotechnology 
also  with the introduction of our small dualbeam products in mid  we were able to penetrate customers who were previously using sem tools with a broader range of solutions and tools that provide greater gross margins than we can obtain on our sem products 
industry and institute sales increased by in as compared to due to sales of our dualbeam products 
gross margin cost of sales includes manufacturing costs such as materials  labor both direct and indirect and factory overhead  as well as all of the costs of our customer service function such as labor  materials  travel and overhead 
our gross margin gross profit as a percentage of net sales by segment was as follows year ended december  microelectronics electron optics components service overall gross profit and margins were negatively affected in by the weakening of the united states dollar in relation to the euro and other european currencies 
the manufacturing operations for our electron optics products are located in europe  and  as the dollar has weakened in relation to the euro and czech koruna  our expenses in these locations have increased  as we have shifted additional manufacturing capabilities to europe  and our margins have been negatively impacted 
in addition  our electron optics segment has experienced pricing pressures from competitors  such as jeol and seiko  who have introduced new products into our markets or who have benefited from favorable currency exchange movements in their home countries 
currency issues reduced our overall gross profit by approximately million in and increased our gross profit by approximately million in currency related issues did not have a material effect on our gross profit in a shift in product mix in  especially within the electron optics segment  to lower margin products  as well as a shift to a greater percentage of our sales being generated by our service segment  have also negatively affected gross margin and gross profit 
service segment gross margins  however  have improved in compared to due to continued improved economies of scale from the additional growth in our installed base of systems 
gross margin in the microelectronics segment was positively affected in by the sale of high margin software products acquired when we purchased egsoft in the third quarter of these sales increased our overall gross margin by approximately in we realized lower gross margins in compared to primarily due to a change in our product mix 
in general  our microelectronics products carry higher gross margins than our electron optics products and our service business carries lower gross margins than any of our other segments 
microelectronics products decreased to of net sales in from of net sales in our service segment sales increased to of net sales in from of net sales in though service segment margins remain well below system margins  service segment gross margins improved in compared to due to continued improved economies of scale from the additional growth in our installed base of systems 
in  our overall margins were also adversely affected by pricing pressures due to weak market conditions and from competitors who have introduced new products into our markets or who benefited from favorable currency exchange movements in their home countries 
we also experienced cost increases in from some of our larger vendors 
as part of our overall emphasis on cost reduction  we are continuing to seek lower product manufacturing costs in by improving our manufacturing and procurement efficiencies through global sourcing and shifting production to more efficient and lower cost manufacturing centers 
during  we transitioned the assembly of certain products from our operations in the netherlands to our new brno  czech republic facility  and additional transfers to the brno facility are planned for as we increase our utilization of this lower cost facility 
in addition  we are working on improving our capacity utilization and redesigning certain products with the intent of lowering overall product costs 
research and development costs research and development  or r d  costs include labor  materials  overhead and payments to philips and other third parties incurred in research and development of new products and new software or enhancements to existing products and software 
r d costs were million of net sales in compared to million of net sales for and million of net sales for r d costs are reported net of subsidies and capitalized software development costs 
subsidies totaled million  million and million  respectively  in  and capitalized software totaled million  million and million  respectively  in  and we anticipate that subsidies will decrease by approximately million in compared to due to contracts that are nearing completion or have recently been completed 
however  we anticipate that r d costs  net of subsidies and capitalized software  will remain relatively constant as a percentage of revenue 
the weakening of the united states dollar in relation to the euro increased r d costs in compared to by approximately million 
r d costs increased an additional approximately million in as a result of our acquisitions of egsoft and revise in the third quarter of and of emispec in the fourth quarter of these increases were partially offset by a decrease in of million in material consumption compared to the increase in r d costs in compared to was attributable to investment in the development of product improvements and upgrades  new software systems and new products to broaden the product line offerings of our business segments 
we anticipate that we will continue to invest in r d at a similar percentage of revenue for the foreseeable future 
accordingly  as revenues increase  we currently anticipate that r d expenditures will also increase 
however  actual future spending will depend on market conditions 
selling  general and administrative costs selling  general and administrative  or sg a  costs include labor  travel  outside services and overhead incurred in our sales  marketing  management and administrative support functions 
sg a costs include sales commissions paid to our employees as well as to our agents 
sg a costs were million of net sales in  million of net sales in and million of net sales in the weakening of the united states dollar in relation to the euro increased sg a costs in compared to by approximately million 
the increase in also includes costs for moving and temporarily maintaining duplicate facilities related to our transition from leased facilities to our new hillsboro facility  which totaled approximately million 
sg a costs increased approximately million in due to our acquisitions of egsoft  revise and emispec and increased million due to increased sales commissions  which resulted from increased sales 
these increases were partially offset by cost containment programs initiated in the fourth quarter of and throughout in addition  we were able to reduce our expenditures in the areas of travel  consulting fees  supplies and other miscellaneous corporate related charges in as compared to for additional information  please also read the section under the heading restructuring and reorganization costs below 
the increase in sg a costs as a percentage of sales in compared to was primarily attributable to the ratio effect of lower sales volumes in and the fact that many sg a costs are fixed or semi fixed rather than variable in nature 
merger costs during  million of legal  accounting and investment banking costs were incurred and expensed in connection with our proposed merger with veeco 
in january  the proposed merger was terminated by mutual agreement of the parties 
there were no merger related expenses in amortization of purchased technology amortization of purchased technology increased to million per quarter in the third quarter of compared to million per quarter in the first two quarters of and in all of due to the acquisition of egsoft and revise during the third quarter of and emispec in the fourth quarter of our purchased technology balance at december  was million and current amortization of purchased technology is approximately million per quarter  which could increase if we acquire additional technology in the coming year 
in addition to the amortization of purchased technology  also includes million of amortization of goodwill  which  pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  that was adopted on july   is no longer amortized effective january  under sfas no 
 amortization has been replaced with a periodic impairment test for goodwill 
purchased in process research and development the million of purchased in process research and development in relates to the write off of certain in process technology purchased in connection with the acquisition of egsoft and revise in the third quarter of the egsoft acquisition in process research and development relates to next generation cad navigation software 
this software was approximately complete upon acquisition  and we expect it to be ready for market in late the revise acquisition in process research and development relates to laser technology to take core samples from silicon 
this project was approximately complete upon acquisition  and we also expect it to be complete in late the million of purchased in process research and development in relates to two projects acquired through our purchase of deschutes corporation 
neither of these projects had been proven technologically feasible or had generated revenue or cost savings as of the date of the acquisition 
the first project concerned image engine technology that could be applied to certain of our existing fib products and improve the performance and reliability of these products 
this development project was approximately complete and was assigned an estimated fair value of million at the date of acquisition 
this project was completed in at a cost of approximately million 
the image engine project technology is being utilized in certain of our current products 
the second project concerned the development of a new metrology tool with wafer handling capability 
this project was approximately complete and was assigned an estimated fair value of million at the date of acquisition 
this project was completed in at a cost of approximately million 
we shipped our first products utilizing this technology in early restructuring and reorganization costs restructuring and reorganization summary the restructuring charges for both the fourth quarter and the second quarter plans are based on estimates that are subject to change 
workforce related charges could change because of shifts in timing  redeployment or changes in amounts of severance and outplacement benefits 
facilities charges could change due to changes in sublease income 
our ability to generate sublease income is dependent upon lease market conditions at the time we negotiate the sublease arrangements 
variance from these estimates could alter our ability to achieve anticipated expense reductions in the planned timeframe and modify our expected cash outflows and working capital 
as a result of restructuring and other cost reduction efforts  as of december   we had reduced operating expenses and materials costs by approximately million to million per year compared to expense levels at the end of these cost reductions  however  were offset by increased costs due to foreign currency fluctuation  increased salary costs primarily in europe  increased insurance expense  increased costs due to redundant operations while we transition manufacturing lines to the brno site and consolidate our hillsboro operations and increased costs due to our acquisitions 
in addition to the charges in connection with our two restructuring and reorganization plans discussed below  this line item includes costs related to relocating current employees 
second quarter restructuring and reorganization our restructuring in included a workforce reduction of employees  or approximately of our worldwide work force 
the positions affected included manufacturing  marketing  administrative  field service  research and development and sales personnel 
all but one termination was completed in the second quarter of the remaining position was terminated at the beginning of the fourth quarter of the following table summarizes the charges  write offs and expenditures related to the second quarter restructuring charge in thousands year ended december  beginning accrued liability charged to expense expenditures write offs adjustments ending accrued liability severance  outplacement and related benefits for terminated employees fourth quarter restructuring during the fourth quarter of  in response to the continuing global economic downturn  we recorded restructuring and reorganization charges of million related to our plan to consolidate operations  reduce excess leased facilities and reduce operating expenses 
costs included in the restructuring charges consist of workforce reductions and other related costs  and facility and leasehold improvement charges related to future abandonment of various leased office and manufacturing sites in north america and europe 
as detailed below  in  we recorded additional charges to our restructuring charge resulting from changes in estimates related to our ability to sublease offices that we had vacated as part of the restructuring 
however  we also recorded reductions to the estimated charges due to lower termination costs in europe due primarily to unanticipated voluntary departures before severance was required and unanticipated redeployment of employees to vacant positions 
our restructuring plan included the reduction of employees  or of our worldwide work force 
the positions affected included manufacturing  marketing  administrative  field service  research and development and sales personnel 
during the fourth quarter of  employees were informed of the headcount reduction plans and the related severance benefits they would be entitled to receive 
approximately of the planned reductions were completed in the fourth quarter of and all but three of the remaining terminations occurred in these remaining employees are expected to be terminated in the positions remaining to be terminated as of december  are located throughout europe 
leasehold improvements and facilities charges represent ongoing contractual lease payments  less estimated proceeds from subleasing activities  and the remaining net book value of leasehold improvements for various buildings located in the united states and europe 
lease costs for these facilities will be charged against the restructuring accrual on a monthly basis when the premises are vacated until the lease contracts expire or the facilities are sub leased 
the majority of these premises were vacated during the following table summarizes the charges  write offs and expenditures related to the fourth quarter restructuring charge in thousands year ended december  beginning accrued liability charged to expense expenditures write offs adjustments ending accrued liability severance  outplacement and related benefits for terminated employees abandoned leases  leasehold improvements and facilities   remaining cash expenditures for severance and related charges of approximately million are expected to be paid throughout the current estimate accrued for cash to be paid related to abandoned leases  leasehold improvements and facilities of million is net of estimated sublease payments to be received and will be paid over the respective lease terms through other income expense  net other income expense items include interest income  interest expense  valuation adjustments  and foreign currency gains and losses and other miscellaneous items 
interest income represents interest earned on cash and cash equivalents  investments in marketable securities and a shareholder note receivable 
interest income was million in  million in and million in the decrease in compared to is the result of lower average interest rates  partially offset by increased average cash and investment balances  which was the result of our receipt of net proceeds of million from our zero coupon convertible debt offering in june the average cash and investment balance increased to million in compared to million in  and the average interest rate decreased to from 
see liquidity and capital resources below for a discussion of the changes in our cash and investment balances during the increase in interest income in compared to was the result of increased cash balances  which were partially offset by lower average interest rates 
the increased cash balances in resulted from a public offering of our common stock in may and our convertible debt offering in august interest expense totaled million in  million in and million in interest expense for  and primarily relates to our convertible debt issued in august in addition  interest expense in includes the write off of million of bond issuance costs and million for the premium paid on the redemption of million of our convertible debt in june interest expense in and also includes million and million  respectively  of interest related to borrowings under bank lines of credit and to borrowings from philips under the philips credit facility  which was terminated prior to the august debt offering 
amortization of our remaining convertible debt issuance costs totals million per quarter 
the valuation adjustment of million in represents a charge to earnings resulting from of our purchase in of the assets of surface interface  inc and the resulting adjustment to the carrying value of our previously existing investment in surface interface  inc other income and expense consists of foreign currency gains and losses on transactions  hedging contracts and other miscellaneous items 
currency transaction losses totaled million in and million in  compared to a gain of million in we enter into forward sale or purchase contracts for foreign currencies to hedge specific cash  receivables or payables positions 
we had realized and unrealized losses and on these hedges in totaling million 
in addition  beginning in july  we entered into various forward exchange contracts to partially mitigate the impact of changes in the euro against the dollar on our manufacturing and operating expenses in europe 
we mark to market any contracts that are not realized in a given quarter 
the realized and unrealized gains related to these contracts totaled million in there were no other significant items included in  or see also item a qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk below for a discussion of our foreign currency gains and losses and hedging activities 
income tax expense our effective income tax rate was in  in and in our effective tax rate differs from the united states federal statutory tax rate primarily as a result of the effects of state and foreign taxes and our use of the foreign export benefit  research and experimentation tax credits earned in the united states and other factors 
the effective tax rate decreased compared to the rate for primarily due to our utilization of foreign net operating losses 
the effective tax rate decreased compared to the rate for primarily due to tax credits for research and experimentation  which were a higher percentage of pretax income in compared to in addition to the factors mentioned above  our effective income tax rate can be affected by changes in statutory tax rates in the united states and foreign jurisdictions  our ability or inability to utilize various carry forward tax items  changes in tax laws in the united states governing research and experimentation credits  the foreign export benefit  and other factors 
in  the world trade organization ruled against the united states tax policies covering united states exports and it is unclear what action  if any  the united states government may take in response to this ruling 
we currently anticipate our effective tax rate to be approximately due to the assumed expiration of the united states foreign export benefit at the end of the first quarter of and the changing foreign and unites states mix of our business 
liquidity and capital resources our sources of liquidity and capital resources as of december  consisted of million of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  million in non current investments  million of available borrowings under our existing credit facilities  as well as potential future cash flows from operations 
we believe that these sources of liquidity and capital will be sufficient to meet our expected operational and capital needs for the next months and will likely be sufficient to meet our operating needs for the foreseeable future 
in  cash and cash equivalents increased million primarily as a result of million provided by operations  million of proceeds from the issuance of zero coupon convertible notes  the net maturity or redemption of million of investments and marketable securities and million from the exercise of employee stock options and employee stock purchases  offset by million used for the purchase of property  plant and equipment  million used for the acquisition of businesses  million used for development of software  million used for the repurchase of million of our convertible notes and million used for the purchase of a convertible note hedge 
accounts receivable increased million to million as of december  from million as of december  of the increase  million was due to the weakening of the dollar in relation to currencies of our foreign subsidiaries 
the remainder of the increase was due to increased sales in the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of our days sales outstanding  calculated on a quarterly basis  was days at december  compared to days at december  inventories increased million to million as of december  compared to million as of december  of the increase  million was due to weakening of the united states dollar in relation to currencies of our foreign subsidiaries 
the remainder was due to a buildup of inventory in europe as we complete our transition of manufacturing lines to our brno site 
our annualized inventory turnover rate  calculated on a quarterly basis  was times for the quarters ended december  and other current assets increased million to million at december  compared to million at december  other current assets at december  included a million receivable related to hedging activities compared to none at december  expenditures for property  plant and equipment of million in included million for our worldwide corporate headquarters and manufacturing site in hillsboro  oregon 
the total cost of this facility to date is million and  as of december   is substantially complete 
as of december   we have completed our plan to vacate all of our leased facilities in oregon and have consolidated operations into the newly purchased facilities 
other significant expenditures in included million for application laboratory and demonstration systems  which exhibit the capabilities of our equipment to our customers and potential customers  and which capabilities we have expanded over the last two years 
we also invest in equipment for development  manufacturing and testing purposes 
we expect to continue to invest in capital equipment  customer evaluation systems  research and development equipment for applications development and additional manufacturing equipment to complete the transition of manufacturing to the czech republic 
our estimated capital expenditures in are approximately million  primarily for development and introduction of new products 
goodwill increased million to million at december  compared to million at december  due to the addition of million of goodwill related to our acquisitions of egsoft  revise and emispec in and million related to milestone payments made related to our acquisition of deschutes corporation see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
other assets  which include service inventories  capitalized software development costs  debt issuance costs  trademarks  patents  deposits and other long term assets  increased million to million at december  compared to million at december  significant components of other assets are summarized as follows in thousands balance at december  additions amortization and write offs balance at december  current quarterly amortization service inventories   n a capitalized software development costs    debt issuance costs     trademarks  patents and other intangible assets   we expect to continue to invest in software development as we develop new software for our existing products and new products under development 
additions to debt issuance costs resulted from the issuance of million in principal amount zero coupon convertible notes 
amortization and write offs of debt issuance costs include million of debt issuance costs related to the redemption of million of our convertible notes in june increases to trademarks  patents and other intangible assets primarily resulted from our acquisitions in our convertible debt increased million to million at december  compared to million at december  as a result of the issuance of million of zero coupon convertible subordinated notes in june  offset by the repurchase of million of our convertible notes in june on june   we issued million aggregate principal amount of zero coupon convertible subordinated notes 
the interest rate on the notes is zero and the notes will not accrete interest 
the notes are due on june  and are first putable to us at the noteholder s option in whole or in part on june   at a price equal to of the principal amount  and on june  and  at a price equal to of the principal amount 
the notes are also putable to us at the noteholder s option upon a change of control at a price equal to of the principal amount 
we can redeem the notes in whole or in part for cash on june   at a price equal to of the principal amount  or thereafter at a price equal to of the principal amount 
the notes are subordinated to our existing and future senior indebtedness and effectively are subordinated to all indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries 
the cost of this transaction  including underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses  totaled million and is recorded on our balance sheet in other long term assets and is being amortized over the life of the notes 
the amortization of these costs totals million per quarter and is reflected as additional interest expense in our statements of operations 
the notes are convertible into shares of our common stock upon the occurrence of certain events at an initial conversion price of per share subject to adjustment  or approximately million shares if the entire million is converted 
upon conversion  we have the option to settle the notes in cash  shares of our common stock  or a combination of cash and shares 
we used a portion of the net proceeds from the offering to enter into convertible note hedge and warrant transactions with respect to our common stock  the exposure for which was held at the time the notes were issued by credit suisse first boston international  an affiliate of an initial purchaser of the notes 
the hedging transactions may be settled at our option on a net basis and run for a term concurrent with the notes 
the warrant held by us offsets the dilution from the conversion of the notes by allowing us to purchase up to million shares of common stock at a price of per share 
the bond hedge creates an upper limit on the cost of the warrant by proportionately reducing the amount of shares deliverable to us under the warrant by the amount that our stock price at the time of conversion exceeds 
these hedging transactions are expected to reduce the potential dilution from the conversion of the notes up to a market price of per share 
the net cost of the hedging transactions has been included in stockholders equity in accordance with the guidance in emerging issues task force eitf issue no

requires that certain financial instruments that  under previous guidance  issuers could account for as equity  be classified as liabilities in statements of financial position 
most of the guidance in sfas no 
is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  the adoption of sfas no 
had no effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab  which updates the previously issued revenue recognition guidance in sab  based on the emerging issues task force issue  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
if the deliverables in a sales arrangement constitute separate units of accounting according to the eitf s separation criteria  the revenue recognition policy must be determined for each identified unit 
if the arrangement is a single unit of accounting under the separation criteria  the revenue recognition policy must be determined for the entire arrangement 
the issuance of sab has not had any impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flow 
critical accounting policies and the use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
significant estimates underlying the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the timing of revenue recognition  the allowance for doubtful accounts  valuations of excess and obsolete inventory  the lives and recoverability of equipment and other long lived assets such as goodwill  existing technology intangibles and software development costs  restructuring and reorganization costs  our ability to recognize tax benefits claimed on our various tax filings or planned filings  warranty liabilities  and stock based compensation 
it is reasonably possible that the estimates we make may change in the future 
revenue recognition for products produced according to our published specifications  revenue is recognized when the title to the product and the risks and rewards of ownership pass to the customer 
for products produced according to a particular customer s specifications  revenue is recognized when the product meets the customer s specifications and when the title and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer 
in each case  the portion of revenue applicable to installation and customer acceptance is recognized upon meeting specifications at the installation site 
for new applications of our products where performance cannot be assured prior to meeting specifications at the installation site  no revenue is recognized until such specifications are met 
revenue  from time and materials based service arrangements  is recognized as the service is performed 
our billing terms on tems  sems  fibs and dualbeam systems generally include a holdback of to of the total purchase price subject to completion of installation and final acceptance at the customer site 
the portion of revenue related to installation and final acceptance  which is  is deferred until such installation and final acceptance are completed 
we recognize software license revenues in accordance with aicpa statement of position sop  software revenue recognition or sop  as amended by sop sop provides specific industry guidance and stipulates that revenue recognized from software arrangements is to be allocated to each element of the arrangement based on the relative fair value of the elements 
under sop  the determination of fair value is based on objective evidence that is specific to the vendor 
we utilize the residual method under which revenue is allocated to the undelivered element  based on vendor specific evidence of fair value  and the residual amount of revenue is allocated to the delivered element 
we recognize license revenues upon delivery of the software 
we generally provide consulting and training services on a time and materials basis and provide maintenance and support services under renewable  term maintenance agreements 
maintenance and support fee revenue is recognized ratably over the contractual term  which is generally months  and commences from delivery of product 
amounts received prior to services being rendered are recorded as deferred revenue  with recognition commencing upon service delivery 
allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated based on past collection problems and known trends with current customers 
the large number of entities comprising our customer base and their dispersion across many different industries and geographies somewhat mitigates our credit risk exposure and the magnitude of our allowance for doubtful accounts 
our estimates of the allowance for doubtful accounts are reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis 
changes to the reserve occur based upon changes in revenue levels and associated balances in accounts receivable and estimated changes in credit quality 
historically  we have not incurred significant write offs of accounts receivable  however  an individual loss could be significant due to the relative size of our sales transactions 
our allowance for doubtful accounts totaled million and million  respectively  at december  and valuation of excess and obsolete inventory inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined by standard cost methods  which approximate the first in  first out method 
inventory costs include material  labor and manufacturing overhead 
inventory is reviewed for obsolescence and excess quantities on a quarterly basis  based on estimated future use of quantities on hand  which is determined based on past usage  planned changes to products and known trends in markets and technology 
changes in support plans or technology could have a significant impact on obsolescence 
because of the long lived nature of many of our products  we maintain a substantial supply of parts for possible use in future repairs and customer field service 
as these service parts become older  we apply a higher percentage of reserve against the recorded balance  recognizing that the older the part  the less likely it is ultimately to be used 
total valuation adjustments to inventory were million and million  respectively  in and lives and recoverability of equipment and other long lived assets we evaluate the remaining life and recoverability of equipment and other assets  including intangible assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
if there is an indication of impairment  we prepare an estimate of future  undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
if these cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset  we adjust the carrying amount of the asset to its estimated fair value 
goodwill goodwill  which represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations  is evaluated for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
we perform our annual impairment test in november each year 
to perform that test  we compare the carrying value of our business segments to our estimates of the fair value of each of those segments 
if the fair value of a business segment is less than its carrying value  we will write down the related goodwill to its implied fair value 
we use estimates of future cash flows  discounted to present value  and other measures of fair value to estimate the relative fair value of each of our business segments 
it is reasonably possible that our estimates of future cash flows  discount rates and other assumptions inherent in the calculation of the estimated fair value of each business segment will change in the future  which could cause us to write down goodwill at that time 
we did not record any goodwill impairment charges in  or existing technology intangible assets existing technology intangible assets purchased in business combinations  which represent the estimated value of products utilizing technology existing as of the combination date discounted to their net present value  are amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the technology 
we currently are using amortization periods ranging from to years for these assets 
changes in technology could affect our estimates of the useful lives of such assets 
we test our technology intangible assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
we evaluate recoverability by comparing the carrying amount to future net undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
such reviews assess the fair value of the assets based upon estimates of future cash flows that the assets are expected to generate 
we review the estimated useful lives of the assets on an annual basis 
we have not changed estimated useful lives or recognized impairment charges related to our technology intangible assets during  or software development costs we capitalize certain software development costs for software expected to be sold independently or within our products 
such costs are capitalized after the technological feasibility of the project is determined and are reported on the balance sheet in other assets 
once we begin to include such software in our products  these costs are amortized over the estimated economic life of the software  which is usually years 
changes in technology could affect our estimate of the useful life of such assets 
restructuring and reorganization costs restructuring and reorganization costs are recognized and recorded at fair value as incurred in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
restructuring and reorganization costs include severance and other costs related to employee terminations as well as facility costs related to future abandonment of various leased office and manufacturing sites 
changes in our estimates could occur  and have occurred  due to fluctuations in exchange rates  the sublease of unused space  unanticipated voluntary departures before severance was required and unanticipated redeployment of employees to vacant positions 
income taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and tax bases of the assets and liabilities 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to more likely than not be realized in our future tax returns 
should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  adjustments to the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets may be required 
our net deferred tax assets totaled million and million  respectively  at december  and warranty liabilities our products generally carry a one year warranty 
a reserve is established at the time of sale to cover estimated warranty costs and certain commitments for product upgrades 
our estimate of warranty cost is primarily based on our history of warranty repairs and maintenance  as applied to systems currently under warranty 
for our new products without a history of known warranty costs  we estimate the expected costs based on our experience with similar product lines and technology 
while most new products are extensions of existing technology  the estimate could change if new products require a significantly different level of repair and maintenance than similar products have required in the past 
our estimated warranty costs are reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis 
changes to the reserve occur as volume  product mix and warranty costs fluctuate 
our warranty reserve totaled million and million  respectively  at december  and warranty expense totaled million  million and million  respectively  during  and stock based compensation we measure compensation expense for our stock based employee compensation plans using the method prescribed by accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
we provide disclosures of net income and earnings per share as if the method prescribed by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  had been applied in measuring compensation expense 
compensation expense calculated pursuant to sfas no 
totaled million  million and million  respectively  in  and off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange rate risk a large portion of our business is conducted outside of the united states through a number of foreign subsidiaries 
each of the foreign subsidiaries keeps its accounting records in its respective local currency 
these local currency denominated accounting records are translated at exchange rates that fluctuate up or down from period to period and consequently affect the consolidated results of operations and financial position 
the major foreign currencies in which we experience periodic fluctuations are the euro  the czech koruna  the japanese yen and the british pound sterling 
although for each of the last three years more than of our sales occurred outside of the united states  a large portion of these foreign sales were denominated in united states dollars and euros 
in addition  because of our substantial research  development and manufacturing operations in europe  we incur a greater proportion of our costs in europe than the revenue we derive from sales in that geographic region 
our raw materials  labor and other manufacturing costs are primarily denominated in united states dollars  euros and czech korunas 
this situation negatively affects our gross margins and results of operations when the dollar weakens in relation to the euro or koruna  as was the case in and a strengthening of the dollar in relation to the euro or koruna would have a positive effect on our reported results of operations  as was the case in movement of asian currencies in relation to the dollar and euro also can affect our reported sales and results of operations because we derive more revenue than we incur costs from the asian pacific region 
in addition  several of our competitors are based in japan and a weakening of the japanese yen has the effect of lowering their prices relative to ours 
as a result of an overall weakening of the united states dollar against european currencies and the japanese yen in and  net sales were positively affected 
as a result of an overall strengthening of the united states dollar against european currencies and the japanese yen in  our net sales were negatively affected 
however  because of the weakening of the united states dollar against european currencies in  and to a smaller extent in  our cost of sales increased more rapidly than our sales 
assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated using the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date 
the resulting translation adjustments increased shareholders equity and comprehensive income for and by million and million  respectively 
holding other variables constant  if the united states dollar weakened by against all currencies that we translate  shareholders equity would increase by approximately million as of december  risk mitigation balance sheet related we attempt to mitigate our currency exposures for recorded transactions by using forward exchange contracts to reduce the risk that our future cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates 
we enter into forward sale or purchase contracts for foreign currencies to hedge specific cash  receivables or payables positions 
we had realized and unrealized foreign currency losses on our transactions of million and realized and unrealized losses on these hedges in totaling million  which are both included as a component of other income 
manufacturing and operating expense related in addition  beginning in july  we entered into various forward exchange contracts to partially mitigate the impact of changes in the euro against the dollar on our manufacturing and operating expenses in europe 
the foreign exchange hedging structure we have set up has a nine month horizon 
we mark to market any contracts that are not realized in a given quarter 
the realized and unrealized gains related to these contracts totaled million in and are included as a component of other income 
other income may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis due to the timing of these hedges and their related accounting treatment 
in addition  at times  we will incur mark to market gains and losses related to contracts that expire in subsequent periods 
accordingly  the related impact to operating margin may be realized in a different period than the mark to market gain or loss 
the hedging transactions we undertake limit our exposure to changes in the dollar euro exchange rate 
the hedges have a bias to protect us as the dollar weakens  but also provide us some flexibility if the dollar strengthens 
as of december   the aggregate stated amount of our outstanding foreign exchange contracts was million and they have varying maturities through august  holding other variables constant  if the united states dollar weakened by  the market value of foreign currency contracts outstanding as of december  would increase by approximately million 
the increase in value relating to the forward sale or purchase contracts would  however  be substantially offset by the revaluation of the transactions being hedged 
a increase in the united states dollar relative to the hedged currencies would have a similar  but negative  effect on the value of our foreign currency contracts  offset again by the revaluation of the transactions being hedged 
we are not able to eliminate all currency risk through hedging activities and  at times  our hedging activities may not be successful 
in early may  we determined that we incorrectly hedged a foreign currency exposure in europe during a period of high volatility in the euro against the dollar  which led to a million loss when the forward exchange position matured in may in response  we modified our review and approval practices to reduce the risk of incorrect hedging transactions in the future 
we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relate primarily to our investments 
since we have no variable interest rate debt outstanding at december   we would not experience a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows as the result of a one percentage point increase in interest rates 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
this is accomplished by investing in diversified investments  consisting only of investment grade securities 
as of december   we held cash and cash equivalents of million that consisted of cash and highly liquid short term investments having maturity dates of no more than days at the date of acquisition 
declines of interest rates over time would reduce our interest income from our highly liquid short term investments 
a decrease in interest rates of one percentage point would cause a corresponding decrease in our annual interest income by approximately million assuming our cash and cash equivalent balances at december  remained constant for due to the nature of our highly liquid cash equivalents  an increase in interest rates would not materially change the fair market value of our cash and cash equivalents 
as of december   we held short and long term fixed rate investments of million that consisted of corporate notes and bonds and government backed securities 
an increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows  as we have the intent and ability to hold these fixed rate investments until maturity 
declines in interest rates over time would reduce our interest income from our short term investments  as our short term portfolio is re invested at current market interest rates 
a decrease in interest rates of one percentage point would cause a corresponding decrease in our annual interest income from these items of less than million assuming our investment balances at december  remained constant for the following summarizes our investments  weighted average yields and expected maturity dates as of december  in thousands  except interest rates maturing in total corporate notes and bonds     weighted average yield government backed securities weighted average yield total investment securities fair value of fixed rate debt the fair market value of our long term fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk 
generally  the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
the interest rate changes affect the fair market value but do not impact earnings or cash flows 
at december   we had million of long term fixed interest rate debt outstanding 
based on open market trades  we have determined that the fair market value of our long term fixed interest rate debt was approximately million at december
