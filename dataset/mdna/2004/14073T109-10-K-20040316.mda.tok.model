our objective is to extend our position as a leading provider of input management solutions 
key elements of our growth strategy include leveraging our existing customer base  leveraging and expanding our sales channels and markets  expanding our international presence  broadening our product offerings  and pursuing strategic acquisitions 
in  our revenues increased to million from million and million in and  respectively 
in addition  in  we became profitable with net income of million  as compared to net losses of million and million in and  respectively 
on july   actionpoint  inc merged with old captiva 
in the merger  old captiva became a wholly owned subsidiary of actionpoint and actionpoint changed its name to captiva software corporation and remained a delaware corporation 
as a result of the purchase accounting that applied to the merger  the results of operations of old captiva are included in our results of operations for the year ended december  only from august  we have included a pro forma presentation below to assist in making comparisons of our results on a combined company basis 
on february   we completed the acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of adp context  inc  an illinois corporation context for approximately million of cash derived from our existing cash and cash equivalents 
we acquired context to expand our presence and application expertise in the payor side of the healthcare market and to extend our reach into the provider side of this market 
we are not planning any significant changes to context s cost structure  and we expect both our consolidated revenues and expenses to increase in the future as a result of this acquisition 
critical accounting policies and estimates a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition or results of operations and requires significant judgment or complex estimation processes 
we believe that the following accounting policies fit this definition revenue recognition our revenue is generated primarily from three sources i software  primarily software licenses and royalties  ii services  including software license maintenance fees  training fees and professional services revenue and iii hardware and other products  primarily sales of digital scanners in the years ended december  and 
table of contents software license revenue is recognized upon shipment provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  fees are fixed or determinable  collection is probable and no significant undelivered obligations remain 
royalty revenue is recognized when our resellers ship or pre purchase rights to ship products incorporating our software  provided collection of the revenue is determined to be probable and we have no further obligations 
services revenue is recognized ratably over the period of the maintenance contract or as the services are provided 
payments for maintenance fees are generally made in advance and are non refundable 
revenue for hardware and other products is recognized when the following criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery of the products and or services has occurred  iii the selling price is fixed or determinable  and iv collectibility is reasonably assured 
for arrangements with multiple elements eg  delivered and undelivered products  maintenance and other services  we allocate revenue to each element of the arrangement based on the fair value of the undelivered elements  which is specific to us  using the residual value method 
the fair values for ongoing maintenance and support obligations are based upon separate sales of renewals to customers or upon substantive renewal rates quoted in the agreements 
the fair values for services  such as training or consulting  are based upon prices of these services when sold separately to other customers 
deferred revenue is primarily comprised of undelivered maintenance services and in some cases hardware and other products delivered but not yet accepted 
when software licenses are sold with professional services and those services are deemed essential to the functionality of the software  combined software and service revenue is recognized as the services are performed 
when software licenses are sold with professional services and those services are not considered essential to the functionality of the software  software revenue is recognized when the above criteria are met and service revenue is recognized as the services are performed 
intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of purchase price and related costs over the value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired 
goodwill is not amortized  but is tested at least annually for impairment 
other intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives  ranging from less than one year to five years 
the determination of the fair value of certain acquired assets and liabilities is subjective in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
determining the fair values and useful lives of intangible assets especially requires the exercise of judgment 
while there are a number of different generally accepted valuation methods to estimate the value of intangible assets acquired  we primarily used the discounted cash flow method 
this method requires significant management judgment in forecasting the future operating results used in the analysis 
this method also requires other significant estimates  such as residual growth rates and discount factors 
the estimates we have used are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage our business  based on available historical information and industry averages 
the judgments made in determining the estimated useful lives assigned to each class of assets acquired can significantly affect our net operating results 
amortization of purchased intangibles is expected to be million  million  million and million for the years ending december    and  respectively 
in addition  the value of our intangible assets  including goodwill  is subject to future impairment if we experience declines in operating results or negative industry or economic trends or if our future performance is below our projections and estimates 
valuation of goodwill we assess the impairment of goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
impairment is reviewed at least annually 

table of contents factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment include the following significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant declines in our stock price for a sustained period  and decreased market capitalization relative to our net book value 
if there were an indication that the carrying value of goodwill might not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators  we would recognize an impairment loss if the carrying value exceeds its fair value 
we performed our annual impairment review in the quarter ended june  and determined there was no impairment 
income tax valuation allowance on a quarterly basis  management evaluates the realizability of our net deferred tax assets and assesses the need for a valuation allowance 
realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income 
the amount of the net deferred tax assets actually realized could vary if there are differences in the timing or amount of future reversals of existing deferred tax liabilities or changes in the actual amounts of future taxable income 
if we do not generate our forecasted taxable income  we may be required to establish a valuation allowance against all or part of our net deferred tax assets based upon applicable accounting criteria 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance  an expense will be recorded within the provision for income taxes line in our statement of operations 
as of december   management has determined that it is more likely than not that our net deferred tax assets will be realized based on forecasted taxable income 
recent accounting pronouncements financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  was issued in january  and a revision of fin was issued in december fin r 
fin r requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
the provisions of fin r were effective immediately for all arrangements entered into after january  since january   we have not invested in any entities that we believe are variable interest entities 
had we entered into such arrangements prior to february   we would be required to adopt the provisions of fin r at the end of the first quarter of  in accordance with the fasb staff position which delayed the effective date of fin r for those arrangements 
we expect the adoption of fin r will have no effect on our financial statements

the line of credit also includes various financial covenants related to our operating results 
as of december   we were in compliance with all loan covenants 
we expect to renew the line of credit prior to its expiration  however  there is no assurance that we will be able to do so under comparable terms or at all 
our principal sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents  as well as expected cash flows from operations and the line of credit 
we may also continue to receive and use proceeds from the sale of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan and the exercise of stock options 
we believe that our cash  cash equivalents and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our liquidity and capital requirements for at least the next months 
we may  however  seek additional equity or debt financing to fund further expansion
