table of contents sales rayonier s sales as reclassified for discontinued operations for the three years ended december   were as follows in millions year ended december timber and land timber land total timber and land performance fibers cellulose specialties absorbent materials total performance fibers wood products lumber mdf total wood products other intersegment eliminations total sales rayonier has customers in more than countries and approximately percent of the company s sales of billion were made to customers outside the united states 
timber and land rayonier buys and manages timberlands  sells standing timber at auction to third parties  sells delivered logs  and also sells its timberland for large tract conservation and real estate development 
the segment executes its strategies in two ways timber and land sales 
timber rayonier owned or leased approximately million acres of timberlands as of december   as follows in thousands of acres region total acres fee owned acres long term leased acres southeast us northwest us new zealand total excluded are approximately  acres managed by rayonier in australia   acres managed in new zealand and  acres of non harvestable or native vegetation land in new zealand 
the company s southeastern us timberlands consist of approximately million acres located primarily in georgia  florida and alabama 
these timberlands proximity to pulp  paper and lumber mills results in significant competition for the purchase of the timber 
approximately percent of timber harvest represents high value wood sold primarily to lumber mills 
the balance is pulpwood used for making pulp and paper 
softwoods are the predominant species on the southeastern us timberlands and include loblolly and slash pine  while hardwoods  the minor species  include red oak  sweet gum  black gum  red maple  cypress and green ash 

table of contents through advanced silvicultural practices  the company has increased volume per acre of timber available for harvest from its southeastern us timberlands by approximately percent per year 
this is a primary factor behind an increasing pine harvest trend over the past years 
northwestern us timberlands consist of approximately  acres primarily on the olympic peninsula in western washington state 
all are owned in fee and consist almost entirely of second growth trees 
these timberlands are primarily softwood stands  with approximately percent hemlock and the remainder douglas fir  western red cedar and spruce 
hardwood timber stands consist principally of alder and maple 
the company s new zealand forest assets consist of  acres of fee owned timberland  plus crown forest licenses that provide the right to grow and harvest timber on approximately  acres of government owned timberland for a minimum period of years 
approximately percent of these timberlands consist of radiata pine  well suited for high quality lumber and panel products 
the balance is douglas fir and other species 
timber is grown and sold for both domestic new zealand uses and for export  primarily to the pacific rim markets 
in addition  the company manages timberlands for other parties in new zealand and australia 
rayonier manages timberlands to scientifically develop forests to their maximum economic value 
the average rotation age for timber from the southeastern us primarily southern pine is years 
the average rotation age for timber destined for domestic and export markets from the northwestern us primarily hemlock and douglas fir is to years 
the average rotation age for timber grown in new zealand primarily radiata pine is to years 
timber in the southeast us is saw timber and pulpwood  while timber in the northwest us and new zealand is primarily saw timber 
rayonier sells timber through a public auction process  predominantly to third parties  and also sells delivered logs 
by requiring the company s other operating units to competitively bid for their timber and wood requirements  the company believes it can maximize the true economic return on its investments 
in  approximately percent of the company s standing timber sales were made to third parties 
these sales were primarily made on either a lump sum or pay as cut basis 
on a lump sum basis  a minimum of percent initial payment is required  title and risk of loss are transferred and installment payments are made in advance for the volume to be cut 
on a pay as cut basis  a minimum percent deposit and a performance bond are required 
payments are made and title and risk of loss are transferred as the timber is cut 
during the fourth quarter of  in anticipation of converting to a reit  the company discontinued offering lump sum contracts in the northwest us and began utilizing pay as cut contracts which qualify for capital gains treatment under section b of the internal revenue code irc 
these contracts require a minimum percent initial payment and title and risk of loss are transferred when the timber is cut 
the company manages its timberlands in conformity with best forest industry practices 
a key to success is the extensive application of rayonier s silvicultural expertise to species selection for plantations  soil preparation  thinning of timber stands  pruning of selected species  fertilization and careful timing of the harvest  all of which are designed to maximize value while complying with environmental requirements 
the following table sets forth timberland acres in thousands as of december   by region and by timber classification region softwood plantation hardwood lands non forest total southeast us northwest us new zealand total includes only fee and leased timberlands and excludes management only agreements in new zealand and australia 
softwood merchantable timber inventory is an estimate of the amount of standing timber at the earliest age that it could be economically harvested 
hardwood inventory is an estimate of the amount of standing timber available for harvest 
estimates are based on an inventory system that continually involves periodic statistical sampling of the timberlands 
adjustments are made on the basis of growth estimates  harvest information and market conditions which may impact the economical harvesting of timber located in wetlands  or other marginal geographic areas 

table of contents the following table sets forth the estimated volumes of merchantable timber by location and type  as of december  region softwood hardwood total equivalent total  in thousands of short green tons southeast us  in thousands of short green tons northwest us  in millions of board feet new zealand  in thousands of metric tons excludes approximately million tons of seed trees and trees located in swamplands 
land rayonier invests in timberlands seeking to maximize its total return from a full cycle of ownership 
the end cycle includes selling portions of its timberland base to capture the appreciated value of its overall asset base 
this program includes selling timberland for others to manage and harvest  as well as selling hbu timberlands 
in november  the company announced that it would routinely sell percent to percent of its timberland base each year to capture the appreciated value of its overall holdings on a more routine basis 
the company plans on periodically replenishing its timberland base through large scale  strategic acquisitions  although smaller acquisitions may be made from time to time on an opportunistic basis 
timberland sales for the three years ended december   are summarized in the following table thousands of dollars  except acres sold timberland sales operating income acres sold performance fibers rayonier is a leading manufacturer of high performance cellulose fibers with production facilities in jesup  ga and fernandina beach  fl  that have a combined annual capacity of approximately  metric tons 
to meet customers needs these facilities are capable of manufacturing more than different grades of performance fibers 
the jesup facility can produce approximately  metric tons  or percent of rayonier s total capacity 
the fernandina beach facility can produce approximately  metric tons  or percent of the company s total capacity 
rayonier produces and sells these performance fibers primarily to meet specific customer orders and specifications throughout the world 
the customers use these products to produce a wide variety of consumer and industrial products 
approximately two thirds of rayonier s performance fibers sales are exported primarily to customers in asia  europe and latin america 
approximately percent of performance fibers sales are made directly by rayonier personnel  with the remainder made through independent sales agents primarily to export locations 
this segment includes two major product lines cellulose specialties and absorbent materials 
cellulose specialties rayonier is one of the world s leading producers of specialty cellulose products  most of which are used in dissolving chemical applications that require a highly purified form of cellulose 
cellulose specialties products are used in a wide variety of end uses such as acetate textile fibers  rigid packaging  photographic film  impact resistant plastics  cigarette filters  high tenacity rayon yarn for tires and industrial hoses  pharmaceuticals  cosmetics  detergents  sausage casings  food products  thickeners for oil well drilling muds  lacquers  paints  printing inks  explosives and lcd screens 
in addition  cellulose specialties include high value specialty paper applications used for decorative laminates for counter tops  automotive air and oil filters  shoe innersoles  battery separators  circuit boards and filter media for the food industry 
rayonier concentrates on and is a leading producer of the most highly valued  technologically demanding forms of cellulose specialty products  such as cellulose acetate and high purity cellulose ethers 
absorbent materials rayonier is a supplier of performance fibers for absorbent hygiene products 
these fibers are typically referred to as fluff fibers and are used as an absorbent medium in products such as disposable baby diapers  feminine hygiene products  incontinence pads  convalescent bed pads  industrial towels and wipes and non woven fabrics 

table of contents the absorbent materials product line also includes paper applications that are made as a secondary product to fluff fibers to help match inconsistencies in demand to capacity 
these paper applications usually represent less than percent of total performance fibers production and are used in the manufacture of bond  book and printing paper 
rayonier also produces and markets an ultra thin engineered absorbent core material that goes into super absorbent sanitary napkins and diaper products as well as other applications 
a  ton per year manufacturing facility in jesup  ga was completed in to bring manufacturing in house and aid in the continued development of these products 
this is a developing business that represented approximately percent of the absorbent materials product line total sales 
wood products the wood products business segment manufactures and sells dimension and specialty lumber and mdf 
rayonier operates three lumber manufacturing facilities in the us that produce southern pine and specialty lumber for residential construction and industrial uses 
the mills located at baxley  eatonton  and swainsboro  ga  have a combined annual capacity of approximately million board feet of lumber  while also producing approximately  tons of wood chips for pulp and paper manufacturing 
lumber sales are primarily to customers in the southeastern us rayonier personnel sell most of the lumber  however sales to certain export locations are made through independent agents 
substantially all of the wood chip production is sold at market prices to rayonier s jesup  ga  performance fibers facility  accounting for approximately percent of that facility s total wood consumption 
the company operates a premium grade mdf facility in new zealand with an annual capacity of  cubic meters 
the company s mdf is marketed worldwide by rayonier personnel  independent sales agents and a new zealand distributor 
other rayonier operates a log trading business in the northwest us  new zealand and chile 
it also exports logs from new zealand and russia 
the company purchases and harvests timber for sale in domestic and export markets 
timber is purchased from both internal and external sources 
in  no timber was sourced internally in the northwest us and approximately percent of new zealand log trading sales volume was sourced from company timberlands 
logs were also purchased from independent dealers who in some cases had purchased cutting rights to company timberlands 
additionally  rayonier purchases lumber and wood panel products for sale in both domestic and export markets 
discontinued operations and dispositions prior years dispositions and discontinued operations include rayonier s new zealand east coast timberland operations and associated assets sold for million in  its port angeles  wa performance fibers mill that was closed on february   its interest in the grays harbor  wa  performance fibers and paper complex  which was closed in  its wholly owned subsidiary  southern wood piedmont company swp  which ceased operations in  its eastern research division  which ceased operations in  and other miscellaneous assets held for disposition 
see also note reserves for dispositions and discontinued operations 
foreign sales and operations rayonier s sales for the three years ended december   by geographical destination are as follows in millions sales by destination united states europe japan china other asia latin america canada all other the majority of sales to foreign countries are denominated in us dollars 

table of contents overseas assets  primarily in new zealand  were approximately percent of total assets at the end of  and rayonier s sales from non us operations were approximately percent of total sales 
see also note segment and geographical information 
patents rayonier has a number of patents and pending patent applications that relate to its proprietary products and processes 
the company intends to take such steps as are necessary to protect its patents and file applications for future inventions that are deemed important to its business operations 
competition and customers the company s us timberlands are located in two major timber growing regions the northwest and the southeast  where timber markets are fragmented and competitive 
in the northwest us  the campbell group  john hancock mutual life insurance co  simpson timber company  weyerhaeuser  and washington state department of natural resources are significant competitors 
other competition in the northwest us arises from log imports from canada by timberwest  interfor and canfor 
in the southeast us  the company competes with plum creek and international paper  among others 
price is the principal method of competition 
in the northwest us  the majority of the company s customers are large  financially stable businesses  while in the southeastern us  the majority of customers are smaller  family owned businesses 
performance fibers are marketed worldwide against strong competition from domestic and foreign producers 
rayonier s major competitors include international paper  weyerhaeuser  georgia pacific and buckeye technologies 
in june of  international paper closed its natchez  mississippi mill  which was a major competitor in the cellulose acetate market 
it is believed that rayonier  the leading supplier in this market  and its cellulose specialties competitors  together have sufficient capacity to assure continued adequate supply of cellulose acetate products to the market 
the final impact of this closure may take a year to fully develop  but subsequent to the closure price increases of to percent have been announced 
in the fluff pulp market  koch industries recently announced that it was purchasing two fluff pulp mills  in brunswick  georgia and leaf river  mississippi  from georgia pacific 
it is still too early to assess what impact  if any  this sale  which is scheduled to close in the second quarter of  will have on the fluff market 
rayonier continues to work towards development of new products and processes that could add additional value to the performance fibers business 
pricing  product performance and technical service are principal methods of competition 
rayonier s lumber and mdf wood products compete with construction and furniture materials manufactured by other companies 
incremental productivity improvements at the company s mdf plant and improving demand in key us  japanese and chinese markets have been negatively impacted by the recent strength of the new zealand currency 
export log markets are highly competitive 
logs are available from several countries and numerous suppliers 
in new zealand  major competitors include carter holt harvey and fletcher challenge 
price and customer relationships are important methods of competition 
the company has no single customer that purchased an amount greater than or equal to percent of its consolidated revenues during the years ended december   or on a segment basis  performance fibers sales included one customer that purchased an amount equal to percent of the segment s sales and four other customers that each purchased approximately to percent of the segment s sales 
the loss of any one of these customers could have a material adverse effect on this segment s results of operations 
in february  a private equity firm made a tender offer to purchase a customer expected to account for approximately percent of our cellulose specialties sales 
it is too early to determine what impact  if any  this transaction will have on our performance fibers business 
seasonality the company s timber and land segment normally experiences lower timber harvest volumes in the third quarter of each year due to the greater seasonal availability of non rayonier timber during the drier summer harvesting period  particularly in the northwestern us the wood products segment may experience higher seasonal demand in the volume of lumber sold in the second quarter of each year primarily due to the relative strength of housing starts 
the performance fibers segment results are normally not impacted by seasonal changes  although most contracts are renewed on january each year 

table of contents environmental matters see environmental regulation in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note contingencies 
raw materials in the us  timber harvesting continues to be restricted by legislation  litigation and pressure from various preservationist groups 
the market supply of timber is also subject to cyclical price swings in wood products and in pulp and paper markets  as well as wet weather conditions which restrict the ability to harvest timber 
in  performance fibers results were negatively impacted by a shortage and resulting higher cost of hardwood  timber and chips for the cellulose specialties product line 
separately  rayonier has pursued  and is continuing to pursue  reductions in usage and costs of other key raw materials  supplies and contract services at its performance fibers  mdf and lumber mills 
management foresees no material constraints from pricing or availability of its key raw materials 
research and development rayonier believes it maintains one of the preeminent performance fibers research facilities and staff in the forest products industry 
research and development efforts are directed primarily at developing new and improved cellulose fiber grades  absorbent materials and related products  improving manufacturing efficiency  reducing energy needs  improving product quality and developing improved environmental controls 
in  to better align itself with its customers priorities  the company began focusing its efforts more on the development of existing core products and technologies versus new product research 
as a result  the headcount at the research center was reduced by approximately percent 
the research center is adjacent to the performance fibers mill in jesup  ga 
research activities related to timber operations include genetic tree improvement programs as well as applied silvicultural programs to identify management practices that improve financial returns from timber assets 
research and development annual expenditures were approximately million in  and employee relations rayonier currently employs approximately  people 
of this number  approximately  are employees in the united states  of whom percent are covered by labor contracts 
most hourly employees are represented by one of several labor unions 
labor relations are maintained in a normal and satisfactory manner 
in august and december  jesup s labor agreements  covering approximately employees  were extended through june  in april  fernandina s labor contracts  covering approximately employees  were extended through april  there were no changes to the jesup and fernandina labor contracts in rayonier has in effect various benefit plans for its employees and retirees  providing certain group medical  dental and life insurance coverage  pension and other benefits 
the cost of these plans is borne primarily by rayonier 
item properties rayonier owns or leases approximately million acres of timberlands in the united states 
the company manages these properties and sells timber to other company operating units  as well as unaffiliated parties 
rayonier s new zealand subsidiary owns or manages the forest assets on approximately million acres of plantation forests in new zealand and australia 
rayonier and its wholly owned subsidiaries own or lease various other properties used in their operations 
these include two performance fibers mills  an engineered absorbent materials eam facility  three lumber manufacturing facilities  an mdf plant  a research facility and rayonier s corporate headquarters 
these facilities are located in the southeastern and northwestern portions of the us and in new zealand 
additional information on mill volumes is disclosed in item selected financial data 
item legal proceedings rayonier is engaged in various legal actions  including certain environmental proceedings that are discussed more fully in note reserves for dispositions and discontinued operations and note contingencies 
on february   the company received a notice of proposed disallowance from the internal revenue service irs  arising from an issue in dispute regarding the company s and federal tax returns  which could have resulted in an additional tax liability of million 
the company had been discussing this issue with the irs since and in the first 
table of contents quarter of it accepted a proposal from the irs the settlement initiative in order to expedite resolution of the matter 
under the settlement initiative the maximum disallowance was set at a percent level 
accordingly  the company adjusted its estimated first quarter tax provision to recognize a tax benefit of million at a percent minimum allowance threshold  to reflect the maximum percent disallowance set forth in the settlement initiative 
in april  the company deposited million with the irs  representing million in tax and million in interest  in anticipation of audit settlements pertaining to this issue 
final resolution of this matter is likely to occur in the next to months 
between and  southern wood piedmont swp  a subsidiary of the company  sent contaminated soil excavated in connection with the cleanup of various closed wood processing sites to a third party processor for recycling 
the processing facility closed in and is the subject of a variety of environmental related charges and a lawsuit brought by the us environmental protection agency epa and the louisiana department of environmental quality ldeq in june  in united states district court for the western district of louisiana against the owner of the processing facility 
also in dispute is disposal liability for approximately  tons of recycled material from sites operated by swp that are still owned and retained by the processor 
currently there are no claims pending against the company or swp by the epa or the ldeq 
however  both have indicated that they believe swp may be liable for some portion of the costs of clean up and disposal of the recycled material sent to the processing site by swp 
if no settlement is reached in this matter  trial is scheduled to begin in september  there are numerous possible outcomes that could determine the company s ultimate liability  if any 
the company believes that reserves at december  adequately reflect the probable costs to be incurred upon the ultimate resolution of the dispute 
see also note reserves for dispositions and discontinued operations 
in december  the united states commenced a lawsuit against the company in the united states district court for the western district of washington to recover approximately million in costs allegedly incurred by the epa in to conduct an expanded site investigation at the company s port angeles mill site 
rayonier challenged the epa s authority to recover this type of cost  as well as the validity of the amount spent 
trial in this matter commenced february  and concluded on february on february  the court ruled that the united states was entitled only to approximately million of the approximately million claimed  and denied a request by the united states for an order permitting it to recover future costs relating to the port angeles site 
while the court s ruling is favorable  the company is evaluating its options as it is unclear whether the united states will appeal the decision 
the company believes that the ultimate outcome will not have a material adverse impact on the company s financial position  liquidity or results of operations and that its reserves at december  adequately include the probable costs to be incurred upon the ultimate resolution of the dispute

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary rayonier s revenues  operating income and cash flows are primarily derived from its two core business segments  timber and land and performance fibers 
the company owns or leases under long term agreements approximately million acres in florida  georgia  alabama  washington and new zealand 
it is the th largest private landowner in the united states 
the company also has been a premier supplier of cellulose specialty grades of pulp for over seventy five years 
rayonier has consistently produced strong cash flows and generated operating results  averaging above many forest products industry indices  by focusing on the following critical financial measures operating income  adjusted ebitda  operating funds flow  free cash flow  debt to capital ratio  return on equity  return on capital employed performance fibers and return on fair market value timber and land 
key non financial measures include safety performance  quality  production as a percent of capacity and various yield statistics 
the company s focus on maximizing returns for its shareholders and generating consistent cash flows from its businesses provided the foundation to convert to a reit  effective january  as a reit  rayonier will have an opportunity to be more competitive on timberland acquisitions to further grow the company and distribute more of its earnings to its shareholders in a tax efficient manner 
the company s regular annual dividend is expected to increase to million in from million in in addition to the financial measures noted above  the company will also focus on cash available for distribution  in total and on a per share basis  in order to meet its targets for delivery of above average market returns 
since  the company has used its cash flows to reduce debt by over million  resulting in a current debt to capital ratio of percent 
the company believes that a debt to capital range of to percent is appropriate to keep its weighted average cost of capital low while maintaining its investment grade debt rating and retaining the flexibility to actively pursue growth opportunities 
the company had million of medium term notes maturing in february which were repaid from the company s undrawn revolving credit facility 
the company does not expect to use cash flows from existing operations to materially further reduce its current debt level in the near term 
operational strategies the company sells standing timber primarily through an auction process  although in the northwest us it also markets timber through log supply agreements 
the company treats timber and land as a stand alone business  requiring its mills and its trading group to compete with other third party bidders for the timber at auction 
this discipline ensures the highest value is received  generating a truer market picture of fair value returns in timber and land  while eliminating the possibility of the company s manufacturing facilities being subsidized with below market cost wood 
the company also focuses on optimizing returns by continually improving productivity and yields through advanced silvicultural practices which take into account soil  climate and biological considerations 
the company instituted a formal timberland sales program in designed to realize  on a current basis  a portion of the appreciated value of the underlying timber asset 
pursuant to such program  the company has been identifying for sale  on an annual basis  approximately to percent of its timberland holdings  primarily properties with values that are greater for development or conservation use than for growing timber 
the company expects to periodically replenish its timberlands through large scale  strategic acquisitions and smaller opportunistic transactions 
the last such acquisition occurred in when the company acquired  acres from jefferson smurfit corporation 
in performance fibers  the company s market focus has been to increase its position as a premier supplier of cellulose specialties while reducing its participation in the more commodity oriented absorbent materials primarily fluff pulp market 
in the cellulose specialties market  where the company is a market leader  its considerable technical applications expertise is used in solving customer problems and in customizing product to exacting specifications  which allows differentiation from most other competitors 
conversely  fluff pulp is a commodity with very little opportunity for differentiation other than by price 
there are a number of much larger companies in this market and as a result  the company is not a market leader 
the company has been successful in executing this strategy of shifting sales from absorbent materials to cellulose specialties production 
in  percent of its volume was cellulose specialties  versus percent in however  while a further shift of volume to the cellulose specialties product line will be challenging  the company will continue to focus on improving product mix toward higher value products within the cellulose specialty product line 

table of contents cost control is also a key element to remaining competitive in the performance fibers markets 
the company s focus is on keeping the mills operating continuously  safely  and efficiently while closely managing raw materials and conversion costs 
the company s capital expenditures typically are directed toward cost reduction and efficiency projects 
industry and market conditions market conditions over the past three years have been mixed 
industry conditions for timber have been weak  but have been improving recently  while the company s land sales program has consistently generated strong interest 
in performance fibers  demand for cellulose specialties has been relatively stable  but the absorbent materials market has been weak  following cyclical commodity trends 
in us timber markets  prices since have steadily declined through the middle of the price declines resulted from an oversupply of manufacturing capacity caused by the worldwide recession and a resulting decrease in demand for wood products  increased timber and wood products availability worldwide and  until recently  a relatively strong us dollar driving imports up 
in mid  tariffs were imposed on canadian imports  with very little effect until well into in late  timber prices improved reflecting a more balanced supply demand equation resulting from a gradual recovery in commercial construction and industrial markets  a continuing strong residential construction market and a reduction in supply due to weather conditions and lower imports 
in performance fibers  cellulose specialties market demand has been relatively stable 
the company s sales are typically made using one to two year contracts which establish prices and target volumes at the beginning of the year and buffer some of the changes in supply and demand 
the company s recognized technical and market leadership have allowed it to maintain relatively stable pricing across its cellulose specialties product lines 
while the company was adversely affected by rising costs in and reported a loss in performance fibers for the first time in ten years  its competitors suffered significantly as well 
for example  international paper closed its natchez mississippi mill  which was a major cellulose specialties competitor  taking approximately two hundred sixty thousand tons of capacity out of the market 
the final impact of this closure may take a year to fully develop but subsequent to the closure  price increases of to percent have been announced 
in the fluff pulp market  koch industries announced it was purchasing two fluff pulp mills  in brunswick  georgia and leaf river  mississippi  from georgia pacific 
it is still too early to assess how this sale  which is scheduled to close in the second quarter of  will impact the fluff market 
over the past three years  absorbent materials industry capacity has exceeded demand resulting in price movement within a relatively low cyclical range 
absorbent materials are primarily a commodity product  but with some product differentiation and enhancement 
sales are typically made with an annual volume agreement that allows price to move with the market during the year 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates the preparation of rayonier s financial statements requires the company to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  reported in this annual report on form k 
the company bases these estimates and assumptions on historical data and trends  current fact patterns  expectations and other sources of information it believes are reasonable 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different conditions 
merchantable inventory and depletion costs as determined by forestry timber harvest models significant assumptions and estimates are used in the recording of timberland inventory cost and depletion 
rayonier employs a forestry technical services group at each of its timberland management locations 
merchantable standing timber inventory is estimated annually  using industry standard computer software 
the inventory calculation takes into account growth  in growth annual transfer of oldest pre merchantable age class into the merchantable inventory  timberland sales and the annual harvest specific to each business unit 
the age at which timber is considered merchantable is reviewed periodically and updated for changing harvest practices  future harvest age profiles and biological growth factors 
an annual business unit depletion rate is established by dividing merchantable inventory book cost by standing merchantable inventory 
pre merchantable records are maintained for each planted year age class  recording acres planted  stems per acre  and costs of planting and tending 
changes in the assumptions and or estimations used in these calculations may affect the company s results  in particular  timber inventory and depletion costs 
factors that can impact timber volume include weather changes  losses due to natural causes  differences in actual versus estimated growth rates and changes in the age when timber is considered merchantable 
a company wide change in estimated standing merchantable inventory would cause depletion expense to change by approximately million 

table of contents in  the southeast pine merchantable age was reduced from nineteen years to sixteen years 
this change  which reduced the depletion rate by in that region  decreased depletion expense by million in depreciation of long lived assets as specifically affected by economic obsolescence the company computes depreciation expense using the units of production method on its performance fibers and mdf production plant and equipment and the straight line method on all other property  plant and equipment over the useful economic lives of the assets involved 
management believes these depreciation methods are the most appropriate under the circumstances as they more closely match revenues with expenses versus other generally accepted accounting methods 
long lived assets are periodically reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
cash flows used in such impairment analyses are based on budgeted results  which take into account recent sales and cost data as well as macro economic drivers including customer demand  industry capacity and foreign exchange rates 
the physical life of equipment  however  may be shortened by economic obsolescence caused by environmental regulation  competition and other causes 
environmental costs associated with dispositions and discontinued operations rayonier has million of liabilities accrued for environmental costs relating to past dispositions and discontinued operations that will be spent over the next to years 
significant estimates are used in determining the proper value of these obligations at a given point in time  especially due to the long term nature of the obligations 
typically these cost estimates do not vary significantly on a quarter to quarter basis 
factors affecting these estimates include  but are not limited to  technological and regulatory changes  results from on going work and management s judgment 
management periodically reviews the company s environmental liabilities for technological and regulatory changes and also engages consultants to assess the extent of additional work required 
a material change in an estimate in any given period could have a favorable or unfavorable effect on the results of the company s operations 
the most recent material change in estimate occurred in  when reserves were increased by million for revised estimates of remediation costs required at the company s closed washington sites  including its port angeles mill site 
the recent favorable ruling in the epa litigation in connection with remediation of the port angeles site see item legal proceedings  after a more detailed review  may result in a reduction to required reserves 
expenditures for all such environmental costs totaled million in and are expected to increase to million in primarily as a result of the increased spending required at the company s washington state and southern wood piedmont sites 
the company expects annual expenditures in and to remain in the million to million range 
determining the adequacy of pension assets and liabilities the company maintains four qualified benefit plans which cover substantially all of the company s us workforce and an unfunded plan to provide benefits in excess of amounts allowable under current tax law to participants in the qualified plans 
pension expense for all plans was million in numerous estimates and assumptions are required to determine the proper amount of pension and postretirement liabilities and annual expense to record in the company s financial statements 
the key assumptions include discount rate  return on assets  salary increases  health care cost trends  mortality rates  longevity and service lives of employees 
although there is authoritative guidance on how to select most of these assumptions  the company s management and its actuary exercise some degree of judgment when selecting these assumptions 
selecting different assumptions  as well as actual versus expected results  would change the net periodic benefit cost and funded status of the benefit plans recognized in the financial statements 
in determining pension expense in  a million return on pension assets was assumed based on an expected long term rate of return of percent  versus an actual return of million 
this long term return assumption calculated using geometric compound averaging was established based on historical long term rates of return on broad equity and bond indices  discussions with the company s actuary and investment advisors and consideration of the actual annualized rate of return of percent through since the spin off from itt corporation 
for  the expected long term rate of return will remain at percent 
management reviews this assumption periodically to ensure that it remains reasonable 
at december  the company s asset mix consisted of percent equities and percent bonds and cash equivalents 
the company does not expect this mix to change materially in the future 
effective december  the company adopted  based on its actuary s recommendation  different mortality tables and revised termination and retirement assumptions to better match recent experience 
these changes increased the december  projected benefit obligation pbo by million 
during the company also reduced the benefit formula used to calculate retirement benefits from percent to percent of final average compensation for the first years of service  effective for all years of service after january  this change did not affect the december  pbo  but is expected to reduce the december  pbo by million 

table of contents in determining its future pension obligations  the company selects a discount rate based on rates supplied by its actuary who incorporate high quality aaa and aa rated  long term corporate bond rates into their models 
the discount rate at december  of percent declined from the december  rate of percent 
this basis point bp decline in the discount rate increased the december  pbo by million 
the company expects its pension expense to increase million to million from the million recorded in due to the net impact of the changed mortality and retirement assumptions  lower discount rate  amortization of unrecognized actuarial losses of million compared to million at december  and decreased benefit formula 
future pension expense will be impacted by many factors including actual investment performance  changes in discount rates  timing of contributions and other employee related matters 
the sensitivity of pension expense and obligations to changes in economic assumptions is highlighted below impact on change in assumption pension expense pbo bp decrease in discount rate million million bp increase in discount rate million million bp decrease in long term return on assets million bp increase in long term return on assets million the company s pension plans were underfunded by million at december   approximately the same position as at december  the company contributed million to its plans during although only million of contributions are required by september to meet minimum funding requirements for the plan year  and an additional million may be required to meet quarterly contribution requirements  the company expects to contribute between and million to its plans in to reduce the underfunded amount 
future funding requirements will vary depending on actual investment performance  changes in valuation assumptions  current liability interest rates  other employee related matters and changes in legislation 
on december   president bush signed into law the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of following the guidance of the financial accounting standards board  the company has elected to defer recognition of this act at this time since specific authoritative guidance on the accounting for the federal subsidy is pending and guidance  when issued  could require a change to previously reported information 
as a result  at december   the accumulated projected benefit obligation and net benefit cost do not reflect the effect of the act on the company s postretirement plans 
realizability of both recorded and unrecorded tax assets and liabilities the company has recorded certain deferred tax assets that management believes will be realized in future periods 
these assets are reviewed periodically in order to assess their realizability 
this review requires management to make assumptions and estimates about future profitability affecting the realization of these tax benefits 
if the review indicated that the realizability may be less than likely  a valuation allowance would be made at that time 
as a reit  if certain requirements are met  only the taxable reit subsidiaries will be subject to corporate income taxes 
however  the company is subject to corporate taxes on built in gains the excess of fair market value over tax basis at january  on taxable sales of property within the reit during the first ten years following the election to be taxed as a reit 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes the company must estimate the amount of timberland that will be sold within the next ten years and retain a deferred tax liability for the expected income tax on these dispositions 
the remaining deferred tax liability resulting from us timberland temporary differences will be reversed in first quarter and recorded as an income tax benefit 
the company estimates this benefit at million to million 
an estimate of taxable dispositions within the ten year post reit conversion period will be updated periodically and may fluctuate significantly based on market conditions and other factors related to meeting the reit qualifying tests 
the built in gains tax can typically be eliminated if sales proceeds are reinvested in similar property within required time periods like kind exchanges 
the company expects to actively pursue like kind exchange opportunities but it is impossible to predict the outcome of such efforts at this time 
in addition  the company has not provided for taxes on approximately million of undistributed foreign earnings as the company has intended to reinvest such earnings overseas in the future 
this assumption is reviewed periodically to ensure that any changes in the company s ability and intent to reinvest these earnings will be properly disclosed and accounted for 
with the conversion to a reit effective january   the company s strategy and preference is changing more toward investing in timberlands domestically 
the effect of this strategic change will be evaluated in the first quarter such amount would be charged to expense when management affirms a change in overseas investment strategy 
as a result  it is probable that a substantial part of these undistributed foreign earnings will become subject to additional cash taxes when remitted  or deemed remitted  as a dividend 
the additional amount of taxes payable if remitted  could approximate million

table of contents analysis of the company s results of operations for three years ended december  results of operations  versus timber and land in the northwest us  sales and operating income in were impacted by lower demand for hemlock and douglas fir resulting in lower overall timber sales prices of percent and a total volume decrease of percent in compared to prior year 
in general  the demand for timber in that region has been trending down over time due to an increase in canadian and south american supply as well as increased saw mill closures throughout the west coast 
in addition  northwest timber volume made available for sale in the fourth quarter of was delayed due to sales contract form revisions in order to utilize the company s new reit status in conversely  this shift should create an increase in the first nine months of volumes offered for sale compared to the same period ended in see item business for additional information on the reit conversion 
in the southeast us  sales and operating income in declined as pine pulpwood continued to be plentiful resulting in an percent decrease in average prices  despite an upturn in price during the fourth quarter

performance fibers cellulose specialties sales increased due to higher acetate grade volume and prices from improved market demand in and customers concern over the continued viability of a competitor s mill 
this was partially offset by lower demand for ethers grades due to inventory and operational constraints at a major customer 
competition in the specialty high value paper grade market continued to be active creating some volatility in volumes and prices in in addition  price increases in most cellulose specialties grades are expected in due to increased economic activity and tighter overall supply 
fluff pulp pricing fell at the end of  and remained depressed during the first quarter of prices increased somewhat in april then held relatively constant throughout the rest of there was virtually no change in average fluff prices from to the increase in absorbent materials prices primarily reflects the relative growth in our high value eam product line

table of contents results of operations  versus sales and operating income sales of billion and operating income of million in were million and million below sales and operating income  respectively 
lower sales and operating income in were a result of unfavorable absorbent materials prices and mix  lower land sales  weaker us timber prices and higher incentive compensation 
these items were partially offset by lower manufacturing costs in performance fibers  lumber and mdf 
timber and land timber and land sales of million were million below prior year and operating income of million was million below the prior year 
timber timber sales of million and operating income of million were each million below principally due to lower us timber prices 
in the southeast us  average pine timber prices declined percent due to an increasing supply of pine logs in the market 
in the northwest us  timber prices declined percent  as market demand for hemlock and douglas fir remained low compared to prior year levels 
these unfavorable variances were partially offset by a percent increase in radiata pine timber prices in new zealand due to the strong export lumber manufacturing customer base in the southland and west regions that the company supplies 
delivered log sales did not significantly impact operations 
land land sales of million were million below prior year with operating income of million decreasing million 
the operating income decline resulted from lower volume  as only  acres were sold in versus  acres in  which included a significant margin contribution from a major timberland sale  acres in the second quarter 
performance fibers performance fibers sales of million were million below the prior year primarily due to lower absorbent materials prices  mainly fluff pulp and unfavorable cellulose specialties prices and mix  partially offset by higher cellulose specialties volume 
fluff pulp pricing is commodity in nature and generally moves in tandem with paper pulp market prices 
during  paper pulp and fluff pulp pricing declined significantly throughout the year 
these markets continued to decline during  although not as severely 
as a result  the company s average fluff pulp prices declined percent in compared to  while its average absorbent materials prices declined percent 
offsetting these price declines was a favorable mix change in the company s cellulose specialties volume  which increased percent 
this included a percent increase in acetate pulp volumes  an percent increase in ethers pulp volumes and a percent increase in high value specialty filter papers pulp volume 
despite the increase in volumes  average cellulose specialties prices declined percent in since  the company has improved its mix of cellulose specialties absorbent materials from a percent ratio to a percent ratio in operating income of million for the segment was essentially at the level as a result of unfavorable prices  offset by lower manufacturing costs and higher cellulose specialties volume 
wood products sales of million for this segment were million above prior year  while the operating loss of million was at the level 
lumber results were essentially at the prior year level with lower manufacturing costs offset by a percent decrease in average prices 
the usual cyclical improvement in lumber prices due to strong housing starts was not evident due to a surge in canadian lumber supply ahead of tariff increases and increased imports driven by the strong us dollar 
mdf results were also essentially at the prior year level  with a percent price appreciation due to mix offset by higher manufacturing costs 
in order to improve operating margins in these non core businesses  the company closed a lumber finishing operation resulting in a million impairment charge to reflect the estimated net realizable value of this asset now held for sale 
impairment testing on the remaining assets in this segment indicates that the net book value is recoverable from estimated future undiscounted cash flows

liquidity and capital resources cash flow on a historical basis  the company s operations have generally produced consistent cash flow and required limited capital resources 
stable pricing in its cellulose specialty business  coupled with cash generated from the sale of timber  timberland and hbu properties  has enabled the company to fund capital expenditures and dividends and provided for debt repayments  absent major acquisitions 
the company uses short term debt borrowings in its cash management activities to help fund cyclicality and seasonality in working capital needs 
long term debt has historically been used to fund major acquisitions

liquidity performance indicators the discussion below is presented to enhance the reader s understanding of rayonier s ability to generate cash  its liquidity and its ability to satisfy rating agency and creditor requirements 
this information includes two measures of financial results earnings from continuing operations before interest  taxes  depreciation  depletion and amortization ebitda  and free cash flow 
these measures are not defined by generally accepted accounting principles gaap and the discussion of ebitda and free cash flow is not intended to conflict with or change any of the gaap disclosures described above 
management considers these measures to be important to estimate the enterprise and shareholder values of the company as a whole and of its core segments  and for allocating capital resources 
in addition  analysts  investors and creditors use these measures when analyzing the financial condition and cash generating ability of the company 
ebitda is defined by the securities and exchange commission  however  free cash flow as defined may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
ebitda is a non gaap measure of operating cash generating capacity of the company 
in  ebitda was million  a decrease of million from the decrease was primarily due to lower operating results  higher pension contributions and a million tax and interest deposit 
in  ebitda was million  a decrease of million from this decrease was primarily due to lower sales in the timber and land segment

free cash flow is a non gaap measure of cash generated during a period that is available for discretionary capital expenditures  increasing dividends above the prior year level  repurchasing the company s common shares and or reducing debt within the period 
the company defines free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations less custodial capital spending  dividends at the prior year level  required debt repayments and the tax benefit on the exercise of stock options 
rayonier defines custodial capital spending  a non gaap measure  as capital expenditures  net of proceeds from retirements  required to maintain its current earnings level over the cycle and to keep facilities and equipment in safe and reliable condition as well as in compliance with regulatory requirements 
the measure is important to properly evaluate the company s cash requirements  to forecast potential uses of cash and for use in valuation models 
the company has a system in place to classify capital spending projects as either custodial or discretionary prior to approval and to track expenditures accordingly  however  the determination of discretionary versus custodial spending still requires some level of management judgment and such limitation should be considered when using this measure 
in  net capital expenditures of million included million of custodial capital spending  of which million was for environmental requirements 
discretionary spending of million was primarily for the replacement of equipment at the baxley sawmill and for the purchase of the jarratt  virginia chip facility 
rayonier expects to invest approximately million in capital projects for each of the two years ending and capital projects include profit improvement  custodial capital  timberlands reforestation and various projects to comply with new environmental laws and requirements 
as new environmental regulations are promulgated  additional capital spending may be required

liquidity facilities in november  the company negotiated a new million unsecured revolving credit facility with a group of banks that replaced both the company s previous million facility and rfr s million facility 
the new facility allows the parent company  rayonier inc and its subsidiaries  rayonier trs holdings inc and rfr  to borrow up to a combined total of million 
the new facility expires in november  and there were no borrowings outstanding as of december  standard poor s ratings services assigned the facility its bbb rating  while re affirming its bbb investment grade rating on the company s long term debt and its stable outlook 
moody s investors service assigned the facility its baa rating  re affirmed its baa investment grade rating on the company s long term debt  but changed its outlook from stable to negative reflecting an expectation of the company s dependence on land sales to cover increased dividend payments and capital expenditures 
in conjunction with the company s million revolving credit facility  certain covenants must be met  including ratios based on the facility s definition of ebitda covenant ebitda 
covenant ebitda as defined by the bank financing agreement consists of earnings from continuing operations before the cumulative effect of accounting changes and any provision for dispositions  income taxes  interest expense  depreciation  depletion  amortization and the non cash cost basis of timberland and real estate sold 
in addition  there are covenant requirements in effect for rfr on the ratio of consolidated cash flow available for fixed charges to consolidated fixed charges 
the company s dividend restriction covenant limits the sum of dividends in any period of four fiscal quarters to percent of covenant funds from operations covenant ffo plus the aggregate amount of dividends permitted under this covenant ffo limitation in excess of the amount of dividends paid during such period 
covenant ffo is defined as consolidated net income of the company excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring and investments in marketable securities plus depletion  depreciation and amortization and the non cash cost basis of timberland sold

as of december  environmental regulation rayonier is subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations concerning air emissions  water discharges and waste disposal 
such environmental laws and regulations include the federal clean air act  the clean water act  the resource conservation and recovery act  and the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act 
management closely monitors all of its environmental responsibilities  together with trends in environmental laws and believes that the company is in substantial compliance with current environmental requirements 
it is the opinion of management that substantial expenditures over the next years will be required in the area of environmental compliance 
during  and  rayonier spent approximately million  million and million  respectively  for capital projects related to environmental compliance for ongoing operations 
during and  rayonier expects to increase spending to approximately million on such capital projects  primarily related to cluster rule compliance as discussed below 
the environmental protection agency epa finalized its cluster rules governing air emissions in but  due to the specialty nature of rayonier s performance fibers products and operations  the agency postponed finalizing water discharge rules and certain air emissions rules governing the company s performance fibers mills and two other dissolving pulp mills 
in late  epa informed the company that it was delegating its cluster rule rulemaking authority for the mills of the company and the other two dissolving pulp mills to the environmental agencies of the respective states 
rayonier will continue to work with the epa and the applicable state environmental authorities to establish such rules for its mills  but the timing and costs associated with such rulemaking are uncertain 
in the opinion of management  capital costs to be incurred over the next five years associated with cluster rule compliance and other environmental regulations are not expected to exceed million at the performance fibers mills 
such capital expenditures are not expected to cause the company in total to exceed an annual average of million to million 

table of contents federal  state and local laws and regulations intended to protect threatened and endangered species  as well as wetlands and waterways  limit and may prevent timber harvesting  road building and other activities on private lands  including a portion of the company s timberlands 
over the past several years  the harvest of timber from the company s timberlands in the state of washington has been restricted as a result of the listing of the northern spotted owl  the marbled murrelet and several species of salmon and trout as threatened species under the endangered species act 
in  the timber industry and federal  state  local and tribal governments  entered into an agreement  known as the forests and fish report 
the washington forest practices board has adopted rules implementing the forests and fish report that further restrict timber harvesting within buffers along streams with fish habitat 
all of these restrictions have caused rayonier to restructure and reschedule some harvest plans and have reduced the total acreage and volume of timber available for harvest 
however  these restrictions have not had a material impact on rayonier s annual harvest volumes  and rayonier has made changes to its long term harvest plan to account for these restrictions 
rayonier currently estimates that expenditures during for environmental remediation and monitoring costs for all dispositions and discontinued operations will total approximately million to million 
such costs  including monitoring and remediation costs  will be charged against its reserves for estimated environmental obligations which the company believes are sufficient for costs expected to be incurred over the next to years with respect to dispositions and discontinued operations 
at december   these reserves totaled approximately million 
the actual future environmental costs will be dependent on the outcome of site evaluations and negotiations with federal and state agencies and may also be affected by new laws  regulations and administrative interpretations  and changes in environmental remediation technology 
based on information currently available  management does not believe that any future changes in estimates would materially affect rayonier s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market and other economic risks rayonier is exposed to various market risks  including changes in commodity prices  interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the company s intent is to minimize the economic impact of these market risks 
derivatives are used  as noted below  in accordance with policies and procedures approved by the board of directors and are managed by a senior executive committee whose responsibilities include initiating  managing and monitoring resulting exposures 
rayonier does not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
cyclical pricing of commodity market paper pulp ultimately influences performance fibers prices  particularly in the company s absorbent materials product line 
however  since rayonier is a non integrated producer of specialized performance fibers for non papermaking end uses  its high value product mix tends to lag on both the upturn and downturn commodity paper pulp prices and its peaks and valleys are less severe 
most of rayonier s revenues and expenses are us dollar denominated 
however  the company does have some risk within its new zealand operation related to foreign currency pricing and costs and periodically enters into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the risks of foreign currency fluctuations 
at december   the company held foreign currency contracts maturing through november totaling million 
the fair value of outstanding foreign currency contracts at year end was an asset of approximately million 
market risk resulting from a hypothetical cent change in the new zealand dollar us dollar exchange rate amounts to an approximate change of million in pre tax income loss 
rayonier periodically enters into interest rate swap agreements to manage its exposure to interest rate changes 
these swaps involve the exchange of fixed and variable interest rate payments without exchanging principal amounts 
at december   the company held two interest rate swap agreements 
one agreement with a notional amount of million swaps a fixed percent interest rate for six month libor rate plus percent 
the second agreement with a notional amount of million swaps a fixed percent interest rate for six month libor rate plus percent 
the fair value of these interest rate swaps at year end  which mature in and  was an asset of million 
market risk resulting from a one percentage point basis points change in the six month libor rate amounts to an approximate change of million in pre tax income loss 
the fair market value of long term fixed interest rate debt is also subject to interest rate risk  however  rayonier intends to hold most of its debt until maturity 
occasionally  callable bonds will be refinanced at the company s option if favorable economic conditions exist 
generally  the fair market value of fixed rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
the estimated fair value of our fixed rate debt at december   was million compared to million in carrying value 
a hypothetical one percentage point increase decrease in prevailing interest rates at december   would result in a corresponding decrease increase in the fair value of our fixed rate debt of approximately million 

table of contents the company periodically enters into commodity forward contracts to fix certain energy costs 
the forward contracts partially eliminate the risk of a change in performance fibers margins resulting from an increase or decrease in fuel oil costs 
the company does not enter into commodity forwards for trading or speculative purposes
