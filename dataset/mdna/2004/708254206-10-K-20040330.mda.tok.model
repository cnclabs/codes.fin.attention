pennichuck water works  inc pennichuck  pennichuck east utility  inc pennichuck east and pittsfield aqueduct company  inc 
pittsfield are involved in water supply and distribution in cities and towns throughout southern and central new hampshire 
these water subsidiaries are regulated by the new hampshire public utilities commission nhpuc and  as such  they must obtain approval to increase their water rates to recover increases in operating expenses and to obtain the opportunity to earn a return on rate base investments 
pennichuck water service corporation the service corporation is involved in non regulated  water related services and contract operations and the southwood corporation southwood owns  manages  develops  and sells real estate  principally through real estate joint ventures

as such  the actual performance of the company may be materially different from the future results or performance implied by the forward looking statements contained in this report 
such factors include  among other things  whether eminent domain proceedings are commenced against some or all of the company s water utility assets  the success of pending applications for rate increases  changes in governmental regulations  changes in the economic and bu siness environment that may impact demand for the company s water and real estate products  changes in capital requirements that may affect the company s level of capital expenditures  changes in business strategy or plans and unusual changes in weather conditions that impact water consumption 
accordingly  the company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
eminent domain the company is the subject of eminent domain efforts by the city of nashua the city and the town of pittsfield the town regarding their desire to acquire all or a portion of the company s water utility assets 
in addition  a number of other communities whose residents are served by one or more of the company s subsidiaries have expressed interest in forming a regional water authority for the purposes of acquiring and operating a substantial portion of the company s water related assets 
the acquisition of company assets by eminent domain would be highly uncertain and likely involve protracted proceedings before the new hampshire public utilities commission nhpuc 
the company s shareholders are not required to ratify or approve any such forced sale of assets  or the price thereof  if so approved by the nhpuc 
given the highly integrated nature of the company s businesses  a forced sale of some or all of the company s water related assets may result in increased costs and operating inefficiencies borne by the remaining assets of the company not so acquired 
additionally  the service corporation s ability to service its existing contracts as well as pursue additional operating contracts may be impaired 
there is no assurance that the city of nashua or a regional water authority  if any  would be successful in acquiring some or all of the company s assets by eminent domain  nor in such case is there any assurance as to the price determined by the nhpuc to be paid for those assets 
the status of these eminent domain efforts is discussed in greater detail in note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
on february   the company filed a petition for declaratory judgment against the city  seeking a determination by the new hampshire superior court that  among other things  the state utility municipalization statute is unconstitutional and the city has failed to commence eminent domain proceedings at the nhpuc in a timely fashion and therefore is barred from continuing the current utility municipalization process against the company

however  the positive effect of those rate increases in was partially offset by a decline in billed consumption within the core system from through the first nine months of  rainfall in the region in which the utilities operate was greater than in the same period of  contributing to the overall decline in consumption for the year

expenses associated with our contract operations were  and  for and  respectively  primarily comprised of direct costs for servicing its various operating contracts and allocated intercompany charges 
the increased expenses from to resulted principally from i additional annualized direct expenses of  relating to the town of salisbury contract   in increased watertight program related expenses  an increase of  in allocated intercompany charges due to additional company and pennichuck resources utilized for the operation and development of the service corporation s various activities  and  of amortization charges reflecting the write off of certain start up and acquisition costs related to non transient  community water systems 
interest expense for the year ended december   our consolidated interest expense was million which was not a material change from interest expense in both years represents interest on long term indebtedness of the company and its three regulated water utilities as discussed in note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and financial condition during  the primary sources of cash needed for the company s day to day operating activities  capital projects  debt service and dividend payments were i available cash from the company s short term investments at the beginning of  ii operating cash flow and iii borrowings under its revolving loan facility with its bank  fleet boston fleet 
at december  and  the company s cash and cash equivalents  primarily short term investments  totaled approximately  and million  respectively 
the million decline in the company s consolidated cash position  together with a million increase in its short term borrowings  were the result of several factors affecting the company s liquidity during as discussed below 
a combination of lower than normal water consumption and increased distribution maintenance costs adversely impacted the operating income of our regulated operating activities by approximately million as discussed earlier under results of operations compared to  water utility operations 
the company incurred costs totaling approximately million relating to the terminated merger with philadelphia suburban corporation  the eminent domain efforts by the city and the regulatory investigations 
our water utility subsidiaries invested approximately million in new and replacement property and plant during  net of only  in contributions in aid of construction from local area developers and state and federal grants 
during  the company utilized its revolving loan credit facility the loan agreement with fleet for working capital and capital expenditure requirements 
under the loan agreement  the company and its subsidiaries may borrow up to million at interest rates tied to the bank s cost of funds or libor  whichever is lower 
at december   there was million outstanding under the loan agreement at floating interest rates ranging from to 
in march  the company received a commitment letter from fleet to provide for million in available short term credit on the same terms contained in the original loan agreement 
this increase in the line of credit is necessary in order to fund i its planned capital expenditures over the next two years  ii any future costs associated with the company s defense against the city of nashua s eminent domain taking  and iii any unanticipated shortfall in operating cash flow 
as disclosed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  the company has certain debt instruments that contain annual sinking fund or other required principal payments 
the company believes that it will be able to refinance these debt instruments at their maturity through public issuance  or private placement  of debt or equity 
our consolidated capital expenditures in totaled million  net of contributions in aid of construction 
practically all of that amount was for projects relating to our water utility business 
in  the more significant projects included  for replacing aging distribution mains in nashua  new hampshire   for the repainting of a million gallon steel tank in pennichuck s core system   for the initial design phase of planned treatment plant filter upgrades  million for the construction of a million gallon storage facility in pennichuck east s litchfield  new hampshire franchise  and million for the replacement and installation of new radio read meters which is part of an ongoing replacement program in pennichuck s and pennichuck east s service territories 
the remaining items in the company s capital program reflect expenditures for ongoing  routine investment in additional pump stations  services  distribution mains and hydrants  vehicles and sundry system improvements 
for  we expect that our total expenditures for capital projects will be approximately million  of which  is expected to be funded by contributions in aid of construction  state grants and low interest  state revolving loans 
our cash needs for capital expenditures are expected to be met from a combination of internally generated funds and short term borrowings under the company s available line of credit 
additionally  pennichuck  the company s largest regulated subsidiary  expects to file a notice of intent to file for rate relief with the nhpuc by late march or early april as discussed earlier 
the company also expects that its cash flow in will be positively affected by the recovery of approximately million of prior years federal tax payments resulting from the carryback of its net operating loss recognized for tax purposes 
this net operating loss resulted principally from additional accelerated tax depreciation allowable under the internal revenue code s recently enacted bonus depreciation rules 
the expected recovery of these income taxes is shown under refundable income taxes in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of december  over the next five years  the company expects to spend approximately million for capital projects in its regulated water business 
of that amount  approximately million relates to the planned filter upgrades in pennichuck s core system water treatment plant 
this project will be undertaken in order to meet stricter standards promulgated by the lt and lt interim enhanced surface water treatment rules issued by the united states environmental protection agency usepa which require the elimination or inactivation of certain microbial organisms to improve disinfection and filtration 
our capital expenditures over the next five years are estimated to be million in  million in  million in  million in and million in pennichuck expects that its future capital investment program will continue to include significant expenditures for replacing aging distribution mains in nashua and in certain smaller community water systems 
in  the city of nashua began a public works program mandated by the usepa requiring the city to separate its storm water runoff and sewer discharge systems over the next years 
pennichuck has taken this opportunity to replace any aged or deteriorating water mains in those sections where the city is performing its sewer separation work 
it is likely that pennichuck will continue to spend to million annually on replacing its aging infrastructure within nashua 
the company s ability to finance its five year capital program will be dependent on  among other things  its future available operating cash flow  and its ability to competitively access both the debt and equity markets 
the company anticipates that these capital costs over the next five years will be recovered in the form of higher water rates 
however  there can be no assurance that the nhpuc would approve a rate increase to cover all of such costs or the timeliness of such actions 
the following is a discussion of other major changes in the company s consolidated financial position from december  to december  notes receivable classified under current assets decreased by  reflecting the net payments received on a development and construction loan to adella realty trust which were repaid in full in may  refundable income taxes increased  principally from the expected recovery of prior years income taxes paid resulting from a tax net operating loss carryback discussed earlier  the net decrease in accrued pension liability of  reflects the company s change in its pension plan funding status from a  accrued liability balance at december  to a  accrued liability at the end of as discussed in greater detail below 
the long term note receivable balance of million at december  represents a note received by southwood from the sale of a acre tract of land to folsom development corporation in january as discussed earlier under results of operations compared to  real estate operations 
under the terms of that sale  southwood conveyed approximately acres of land in exchange for approximately  in cash and a long term note receivable of  the note  which matures in october  carries a floating interest rate of prime plus and is secured by a first mortgage on the property 
investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries at december  and  the company s wholly owned real estate subsidiary  the southwood corporation  had a percent ownership interest in four limited liability companies llc s as discussed in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the remaining ownership interest in each of the llc s is held by john stabile  a local developer  with whom southwood has also participated in four residential joint ventures during the past years 
the formation of these llc s provides southwood with an opportunity to develop its landholdings in such a manner as to provide for a long term income stream through commercial rental activities 
additionally  the llc s  as legal entities  mitigate the financial risk associated with sole ownership of developed commercial properties by southwood 
the llc s  whose assets and liabilities are not included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets  own certain commercial office buildings on wh ich there are outstanding mortgage notes totaling million and million as of december  and  respectively 
southwood is contingently liable on one half of the outstanding mortgage balances and as such  it has issued a guarantee to the mortgagee for its share of the guaranteed indebtedness 
the principal assets of the llc s are the land  buildings and leasehold improvements  the total of which at december  and was million and million  respectively 
contractual obligations the following table discloses aggregate information about our contractual obligations and the periods in which payments are due less than to to after total year years years years long term debt capital leases operating leases pension and post retirement contributions purchase obligations total pension and post retirement contributions cannot be reasonably estimated beyond and may be impacted by such factors as return on pension assets  changes in the number of plan participants and future salary increases 
pennichuck has a wholesale water agreement the agreement with manchester nh water works mww to purchase water from mww through six metering points for various community water systems owned by pennichuck and pennichuck east 
the agreement  amended in february  has a year term and provides for an average daily flow to pennichuck and pennichuck east of up to million gallons per day mgd with a maximum daily flow rate of mgd 
pennichuck and pennichuck east purchase water at a rate established by mww for all of its non manchester customers 
the current rate  effective january  is per one hundred cubic feet ccf in areas where fire protection is not provided by mww and per ccf where fire protection is provided 
the agreement requires that pennichuck and pennichuck east pay a one time source development charge sdc of for each gallon of the million gallons of the average daily flow 
to date  pennichuck and pennichuck east had achiev ed a combined peak average daily flow of  gallons 
the sdc is re calculated annually to reflect any increases in average daily flow and  if the flow is increased  pennichuck and pennichuck east pay the sdc for the incremental demand 
any incremental sdc is payable in january of each year 
sdc payments began in and as of december   the total sdc paid to mww was  which allows the company to draw an average daily flow of up to  the incremental sdc paid in and was  and  respectively 
there was no sdc due in january since the average daily flow in was less than the previous high average usage level established in any future payments to mww would be subject to an increase in average daily flow 
no future obligations under this contract are disclosed since such future payments are based on future water consumption levels that are affected by weather conditions and customer growth 
in late march or early april  pennichuck expects to enter into a long term lease arrangement with hecop iii  llc for approximately  square feet of office space located in merrimack  new hampshire to serve as the company s headquarters 
southwood holds a fifty percent ownership interest in hecop iii  llc and the remaining ownership interests are held by john stabile  who is also the holder of ownership interests in three other llc joint ventures with southwood as discussed above 
the final execution of the lease is not expected to occur until the end of the first quarter of pension plan the company maintains a defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all of its employees 
the accounting for this plan under fasb  employer s accounting for pensions  requires that the company use key assumptions when computing the estimated annual pension expense 
these assumptions are i the discount rate applied to the projected benefit obligation  ii the long term rate of return on plan assets and iii the long term rate of future increases in compensation 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of our pension obligations and our annual pension expense 
we have reduced our discount rate from to for reflecting the overall change in market conditions 
our expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets is based on the plan s expected asset allocation  expected returns on various classes of plan assets as well as historical returns 
we assumed that our long term rate of return on pension plan assets was in and and in in addition  we assumed an increase in participant compensation levels of  and in  and  respectively 
these key assumptions are reviewed annually with our actuary and investment advisor and are updated to reflect the plan s experience 
actual results in any given year will often differ from our actuarial assumptions because of economic and other conditions which may impact the amount of pension expense the company recognizes 
at december   the company had a minimum pension liability of approximately  representing the excess of its pension liabilities over its plan assets 
however  during  the rate of return on plan investments was approximately compared to a negative rate of return of in as a result  the market value of the company s plan assets was slightly lower than its accumulated benefit obligation by approximately  at december  the company has recorded an adjustment of approximately  which resulted in a pension liability of approximately  at the end of and a credit  net of taxes  of approximately  to other comprehensive income 
future adjustments to other comprehensive income will be affected by changes in realized returns on pension plan assets  contributions to pension assets by the company and changes in discount rates 
critical accounting policies the company has identified the accounting policies below as those policies critical to its business operations and the understanding of the results of operations 
the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
changes in the estimates or other judgments included within these accounting policies could result in significant changes to the financial statements 
our critical accounting policies are as follows 
regulatory accounting the use of regulatory assets and liabilities as permitted by statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation stipulates generally accepted accounting principles for companies whose rates are established by or are subject to approval by an independent third party regulator 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we defer costs and credits on the balance sheet as regulatory assets and liabilities when it is probable that these costs and credits will be recognized in the rate making process in a period different from when the costs and credits were incurred 
these deferred amounts  both assets and liabilities  are then recognized in the income statement in the same period that they are reflected in rates charged to our water utilities customers 
in the event that the inclusion in the rate making process is disallowed  the associated regulatory asset or liability would be adjusted to reflect the change in our assessment or change in regulatory approval 
revenue recognition utility revenues are based on authorized rates approved by the nhpuc 
estimates of water utility revenues for water delivered to customers but not yet billed are accrued at the end of each accounting period 
the company reads its residential customer meters generally on a quarterly basis and records its revenue based on meter reading results 
unbilled revenues from the last meter reading date to the end of the accounting period are estimated based on historical usage patterns and the effective water rates 
the estimate of the unbilled revenue is a management estimate utilizing certain sets of assumptions and conditions
