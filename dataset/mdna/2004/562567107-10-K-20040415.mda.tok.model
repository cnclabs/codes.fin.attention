item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are one of the four largest hotel casino operators in the united states  in terms of revenues  rooms and casino space 
our operations consist of wholly owned resorts in nevada and mississippi  as well as jointly owned resorts in nevada  illinois and michigan 
our resorts cater to a wide variety of customers  from value oriented to high end  and we strive to provide the best overall experience in each of the market segments in which we compete 
our core market is las vegas  the world s largest gaming market  where our properties are expected to generate approximately of our operating income in fiscal we have the largest scaled hotel casino resort development in las vegas 
our mandalay mile consists of three interconnected megaresorts on acres  and includes our flagship property  mandalay bay 
mandalay bay is typically the best performer among our properties  as it possesses amenities that appeal to higher income customers 
strong demand from this segment of our customer base has permitted us greater pricing leverage  which has helped to drive results at this property 
with the recent additions of the convention center  an all suites hotel tower and a retail center discussed more fully under financial position and capital resources new projects below  mandalay bay should continue to be the leading driver of near term growth for our company 
our operating results are highly dependent on the volume of customers visiting and staying at our resorts  which drives results in our two principal revenue centers the casino and the hotel 
we generate approximately of our revenues from gaming activities  and approximately from hotel operations 
the volume of casino activity is measured by drop  which refers to amounts wagered by our customers 
the amount of drop which we keep and recognize as casino revenue is referred to as our win or hold 
in our hotel business  the key metric is revenue per available room  or revpar 
revpar reflects both occupancy levels and room rates  each of which is impacted by customer demand  among other factors 
although the casino accounts for approximately of our revenues companywide  we consider the hotel to be the principal driver of our business in the las vegas market 
this is due to the fact that the majority of our revenues are derived from in house customers  that is  customers who stay in our hotel rooms 
consequently  to the extent we can place higher value customers in our rooms  we can generate increased revenues throughout our properties 
furthermore  due to the nature of gaming activities  we have little pricing leverage in the casino  whereas we possess significant pricing leverage in our rooms 
risks and uncertainties our operations are exposed to various risks  the most significant of which are increased competition  tax increases  economic downturns and future security alerts or terrorist attacks 
competition historically  in our core market of las vegas  the addition of new competing hotel casino resorts has not had a negative effect on our operations 
in fact  major new developments have typically expanded the market and actually contributed to higher results at our properties 
however  the expansion of native american gaming operations in california and our other key feeder markets has contributed to generally lower operating results at our properties in the secondary markets of reno  laughlin and jean  nevada 
while most existing native american gaming facilities in california are modest compared to our nevada casinos  numerous native american tribes have announced that they are in the process of constructing  developing  or are considering establishing  new large scale hotel and gaming facilities  or expanding existing facilities  in california 
for example  a significant new native american casino development which opened in june in northern california has placed significant additional competitive pressure on our operations in the reno market 
in addition  under action taken by the national indian gaming commission  gaming devices similar in appearance to slot machines which are deemed to be technical enhancements to bingo style gaming may be used by native american tribes without state permission  making it easier for tribes to engage in gaming 
the continued growth of native american gaming establishments in california as well as elsewhere in the country  or the potential placement of slot machines in card rooms or racetracks in california  could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
taxes we pay substantial amounts of income taxes  gaming taxes  property taxes and various other taxes 
significant increases in tax rates could materially affect our results 
for example  two recent increases in the gaming tax rate in illinois have contributed to significant declines in the contribution to income from operations by grand victoria our owned riverboat casino over the past two fiscal years 
recent tax increases in nevada have had a less significant effect 
see the discussion under recent tax developments under results of operations for additional details regarding these tax increases 
economy historically  there has not been a high correlation between economic conditions and our operating results 
this has been true with respect to the overall us economy and also the regional economies from which we derive a sizeable portion of our customers eg  california 
however  we believe an economic downturn in the country did affect our results in the first part of fiscal conversely  we believe the subsequent economic recovery contributed to positive results in the latter part of our fiscal year 
terrorism war terrorist attacks  such as those that occurred september   can materially affect our operations 
in that specific instance  the precipitous decline in air travel that immediately followed the attacks was particularly detrimental to the las vegas market  which depends on air travel for roughly of its customers 
this negatively affected results at our properties in fiscal and  to a lesser extent  in fiscal more recently  we believe that the war in iraq affected our operating results in the first quarter of fiscal the intense and comprehensive media coverage of the war  along with new travel concerns associated with elevated alert levels  caused many customers to stay close to home during march and april in las vegas  visitor volume dropped in march and in april  compared to the same periods in the prior year 
however  we believe the war and its aftermath did not significantly affect our results in the latter three quarters of our fiscal year  when las vegas visitor volume increased from the previous year 
we cannot predict the extent to which the aftermath of the war in iraq  or the ongoing war on terrorism  will continue to directly or indirectly impact our operating results  nor can we predict the extent to which future security alerts or terrorist attacks may interfere with our operations 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements included in this report were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
certain accounting policies require us to apply significant judgment in defining the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
by their nature  such judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
these judgments are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  observance of trends in the gaming industry and information available from other outside sources 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from these estimates 
the following is a summary of our critical accounting policies 
property and equipment we have significant capital invested in our property and equipment  which represents of our total assets 
we utilize our judgment in i determining whether an expenditure is a maintenance expense or a capital asset  ii determining the estimated useful lives of assets  iii determining the salvage values to be assigned to assets  and iv determining if or when an asset has been impaired 
the accuracy of these estimates affects how much depreciation expense we recognize in our income statement  whether we have a gain or loss on the disposal of an asset  and whether or not we record an impairment loss related to an asset 
we review the carrying value of our property and equipment whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable  based upon the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition 
the factors we consider in performing this assessment include current operating results  trends and prospects  as well as the effects of obsolescence  demand  competition and other economic factors 
in estimating expected future cash flows  we group assets at the operating unit level  which for most of our assets is the individual casino 
if the sum of the expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying amount  we recognize an impairment loss 
the impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value 
the ability to accurately predict future cash flows may impact the determination of fair value and  hence  the amount of the impairment loss 
our assessment of cash flows represents our best estimate at the time of the impairment review and is consistent with our internal planning 
based upon our most recent review of the carrying values of our property and equipment  we do not believe that any additional impairments have occurred or are likely to occur in the near term 
goodwill and other intangible assets effective february   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  which requires an annual review of goodwill and other indefinite life intangible assets for impairment 
our initial assessment of these assets resulted in an impairment charge of million  reflected as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first quarter of fiscal our subsequent annual assessment for fiscal resulted in an additional impairment charge of million 
these impairment charges were necessitated by significant declines in income from operations at the affected properties  as well as lower future expectations attributable to increased competition from native american casinos 
the annual evaluation of goodwill and other indefinite life intangible assets requires the use of projections about future operating results at each reporting unit to determine the assets estimated fair value 
changes in forecasted operations can materially affect these estimates 
once an impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets has been recorded  it cannot be reversed 
based upon our annual assessment of goodwill and intangible development costs for fiscal  we do not believe that there are additional impairments that have occurred or are likely to occur in the near term 
we had million in goodwill and million in intangible development costs on our consolidated balance sheet at january  the goodwill relates entirely to our acquisition of slots a fun and our investment in motorcity casino in detroit 
the carrying value of goodwill related to those investments  relative to the market value of the other assets  is small  furthermore  operating results at these properties have historically been strong and stable 
players club program our players club program offers incentives to customers who gamble at our casinos 
customers earn points  redeemable for cash and complimentaries  based upon their level of gambling 
these points may accumulate up to a maximum of months  at which time the points expire if the customer has not yet redeemed them 
we accrue expense related to this program as the points are earned based upon historical redemption percentages and  in the case of complimentaries  the estimated cost of the complimentaries to be provided 
the actual amount of expense can differ from the amount accrued to the extent that actual redemptions differ from historical patterns 
through fiscal  approximately of the points earned and available had been redeemed 
the total accrued liability related to our players club was million at january   compared with million at january  bad debt reserves our receivables balances relate primarily to our hotel operations and our casino operations 
historically  we have not reserved amounts related to our hotel operations  since the majority of those receivables relate to credit card transactions for which we have not historically experienced any material losses 
for our casino operations  we reserve an estimated amount for receivables that may not be collected 
we estimate casino bad debt reserves using a combination of specific reserves and various percentages applied to aged receivables based upon our judgment 
we consider historical collection rates along with customer relationships in determining specific reserves 
at january   we had million in our casino bad debt reserve  representing approximately of the related casino receivables 
at january   we had million in the reserve  representing approximately of the related casino receivables 
the reserve percentage was lower in fiscal because a larger portion of the casino receivables were current compared to fiscal to the extent that world events such as economic downturns  war or further terrorist attacks impact the ability of our customers to pay us  our reserves could be inadequate 
however  a significant portion of our casino receivables relate to domestic play 
consequently  we believe our casino receivables are less exposed to the impact of some of these events  and that our current reserve is appropriate and reasonable based upon our experience 
self insurance accruals we are self insured  up to certain limits  for costs associated with workers compensation and employee medical coverage 
insurance claims and reserves include accruals of estimated settlements for known claims  as well as accruals of estimates for claims incurred but not yet reported 
at january   we had total self insurance accruals reflected on our balance sheet of million  compared with million at january  we believe our estimates of future liability are reasonable based upon our methodology  which considers historical claims patterns and loss experience  among other factors 
however  changes in health care costs  accident frequency and severity  and other factors could materially affect the estimate for these liabilities 
income taxes we are subject to both federal and state income taxes 
we account for income taxes according to statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
sfas requires the recognition of deferred tax assets  net of applicable reserves  related to net operating loss carryforwards and certain temporary differences 
the standard requires recognition of a future tax benefit to the extent that realization of such a benefit is more likely than not 
otherwise  a valuation allowance is applied 
at january   we had million of deferred tax assets and million of deferred tax liabilities 
we believe that our deferred tax assets are fully realizable because of the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences and future projected taxable income 
our income tax returns are subject to examination by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities 
we regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and our income tax liabilities 
inherent in our determination of any necessary reserves are assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about potential actions by taxing authorities 
our estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental  though we believe that our exposure to uncertain tax matters is immaterial 
when actual results of tax examinations differ from our estimates  we adjust the income tax provision in the period in which the examination issues are settled 
in august  we settled the irs audits of our fiscal through fiscal tax returns  which did not result in a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
additionally  in may  we settled the irs audits of our fiscal through fiscal tax returns 
this settlement did not materially impact our results of operations or financial position 
contingencies we are involved in various legal proceedings  as more fully discussed in item of this report 
due to their nature  such legal proceedings involve inherent uncertainties including  but not limited to  court rulings  negotiations between affected parties and governmental intervention 
management assesses the probability of loss for such contingencies and accrues a liability and or discloses the relevant circumstances  as appropriate 
we believe that any liability that may arise as a result of currently pending legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  taken as a whole 
fiscal compared with fiscal results of operations earnings per share for the year ended january   we reported net income of million  or per diluted share  versus million  or per diluted share  for the year ended january  the principal factors which contributed to the increase in earnings were strong results at our las vegas strip properties 
income from operations at our las vegas strip properties including our share of monte carlo increased million  or in fiscal  driven primarily by a increase in revpar 
the new convention center and the all suites tower at mandalay bay thehotel contributed to a pronounced shift towards the more profitable convention customer 
this significantly benefited revpar at mandalay bay and  to a lesser extent  the adjacent luxor 
we also believe that the rebound in the national economy positively affected results at all of our las vegas strip properties  particularly in the latter half of our fiscal year 
lower average diluted shares outstanding 
average diluted shares outstanding for fiscal decreased from the prior year  reflecting the effect of substantial share purchases in the latter half of fiscal  as well as the march settlement of our equity forward agreement pursuant to which we acquired an additional million shares 
these purchases were somewhat offset by the issuance of million shares in fiscal pursuant to the exercise of employee stock options 
other significant factors which affected our fiscal and results included the following preopening expenses 
we recorded preopening expenses of million in fiscal related primarily to thehotel  which opened in december at mandalay bay  and mandalay place  the new retail center connecting mandalay bay and luxor that opened in october for fiscal  preopening expenses of million related primarily to the new convention center at mandalay bay that opened in january adjustments to carrying values 
at the end of each quarterly reporting period  we adjust the carrying value of investments associated with our supplemental executive retirement plan serp  a defined benefit plan for senior executives  to reflect the investments market value 
these noncash adjustments reflected in the interest  dividends and other income caption in the consolidated statements of income resulted in a gain of million in fiscal compared with a loss of million in fiscal loss on early retirement of debt 
results for fiscal include a loss of million on early retirement of debt arising from the july call of our million senior subordinated notes due write off of intangibles 
results for fiscal reflect the write off of million of intangible costs associated with motorcity casino in detroit 
these intangible costs represented amounts paid by mandalay to its partner  atwater casino group  in exchange for a so called preference applicable to predecessors of atwater casino group to develop a casino in detroit 
in early  preferences of this nature were declared unconstitutional by a federal appeals court 
on august   motorcity signed a revised development agreement with the city of detroit which provided for the development of an expanded casino on the site of the current facility 
as a result of these events  it was determined that the intangible preference had no value and should be written off 
goodwill impairment 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  became effective for mandalay on february  under sfas  goodwill is no longer amortized  but must be reviewed at least annually for impairment 
in connection with our implementation of sfas  we completed an analysis of the goodwill arising from our prior acquisitions and recorded a write off of million  representing the unamortized goodwill associated with the june  acquisition of the railroad pass hotel and casino in henderson  nevada 
this write off was reflected as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first quarter of fiscal pursuant to our subsequent annual review for goodwill impairment  we recorded a write off of million that was reflected as an impairment loss in the fourth quarter of fiscal this latter write off represented the unamortized goodwill associated with the february   acquisition of the edgewater hotel and casino in laughlin  nevada 
the write off was necessitated by a decline in income from operations at that property  and by lower future expectations for the laughlin market arising from increased competition from native american casinos 
revenues revenues increased million  or  for fiscal  due largely to results at our las vegas strip properties 
mandalay bay was the largest contributor  with revenues rising million  or  over the prior year 
as previously noted  this property benefited substantially from the new convention center and  to a lesser extent  from the december opening of thehotel  which together helped drive a increase in room revenue at the property 
casino revenues casino revenues rose million  or  in fiscal in las vegas  excalibur led the way with a million  or  increase in casino revenues 
this increase was attributable to improved occupancy levels along with a higher hold percentage stemming from a change in the mix of pit games and slot machines 
mandalay bay reported a million  or  increase in casino revenues  benefiting from the increased casino traffic generated by the convention center and thehotel 
elsewhere in nevada  casino revenues were mostly down  due to the effects of expanded native american gaming 
meanwhile  casino revenues at the gold strike resort in tunica county  mississippi rose million  or  driven by the upturn in the economy and increased marketing efforts  which have resulted in that property gaining market share 
hotel revenues hotel revenues increased million  or  in fiscal our las vegas strip properties were the source for most of the increase 
revpar grew at these properties  which accounted for approximately  rooms out of  rooms companywide including the owned monte carlo 
mandalay bay was the most significant contributor  generating an increase of million  or  driven by a increase in revpar 
as noted earlier  with the opening of the convention center and thehotel  this property has increased its emphasis on the business and convention segment of the market  which has traditionally been willing to pay a higher rate for midweek rooms 
in fiscal  approximately of mandalay bay s room nights were sold to the convention segment  compared with approximately in the previous year  and we expect this percentage to rise 
hotel revenues at mandalay bay also include revenues related to the rental of the new convention space  which amounted to million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal the following table compares average room rates  occupancy and revpar at our major wholly owned properties fye fye rate occ 
revpar rate occ 
revpar mandalay bay luxor excalibur circus circus las vegas circus circus reno colorado belle edgewater gold strike tunica weighted average all wholly owned properties weighted average wholly owned las vegas strip properties food and beverage revenues food and beverage revenues increased million  or  in fiscal the increase was due mainly to the expansion of mandalay bay s convention business following the opening of the new convention center in january and subsequent opening of thehotel in december other revenues other revenues come principally from entertainment  amusements and retail stores  and rose 
million  or less than  in fiscal while the successful february opening of mamma mia generated additional entertainment revenue at mandalay bay  the increase was offset by the absence of a major boxing match that was held in the events center at mandalay bay during the prior year the oscar de la hoya fernando vargas fight 
costs and expenses depreciation and amortization for fiscal  depreciation and amortization expense was million versus million in fiscal the increase of million was due primarily to the june  exercise of purchase options under our two operating lease agreements  pursuant to which we paid million to acquire the equipment under the leases 
see the discussion in financing activities other financing transactions under financial position and capital resources for additional details 
the resulting increase was partially offset by the reduction of depreciation expense at motorcity casino 
based upon a revised development agreement entered into with the city of detroit on august  discussed more fully under financial position and capital resources new projects  depreciation expense related to the motorcity casino temporary facility was reduced prospectively 
previously  the cost of the temporary facility was being depreciated over its contractual operating term of four years  with annual depreciation expense approximating million 
under the revised development agreement  the existing facility will be expanded into a permanent resort as opposed to the permanent resort being developed on a separate site as was the requirement under the original development agreement 
as a result  the remaining book value of the existing facility is being depreciated over its remaining expected life  resulting in estimated annual depreciation expense of million  pending construction of the expanded permanent facility or other equipment additions 
operating lease rent operating lease rent for fiscal decreased to million from million in fiscal the decrease was related primarily to the previously discussed june  termination of our operating leases 
see the discussion under off balance sheet arrangements operating leases under financial position and capital resources for additional details regarding our operating lease agreements 
income from operations for the year ended january   income from operations rose million  or  from the previous year 
the composite operating margin in fiscal was versus in fiscal income from operations for fiscal benefited from improved operating results at our las vegas strip properties  as discussed more fully below 
comparisons also benefited from lower depreciation and amortization expense at motorcity casino see the discussion under depreciation and amortization above and the previously discussed write off of million in intangible costs associated with motorcity casino in fiscal the above benefits were partially offset by a decrease in earnings from unconsolidated affiliates of million  stemming from the impact of higher gaming taxes at the owned grand victoria in elgin  illinois  discussed in more detail below 
the table below summarizes our operating results by property and is followed by a discussion of operating results by market

includes gold strike  nevada landing and railroad pass 
motorcity casino is owned and its operations are consolidated for financial reporting purposes 
includes monte carlo  grand victoria and silver legacy  each of which is owned 
las vegas our las vegas properties including our share of monte carlo posted an overall increase in income from operations of million  or  in fiscal at mandalay bay  income from operations rose million  or 
as noted previously  this property benefited from the opening of the new convention center and thehotel  which have contributed to higher revpar during the slower midweek period 
furthermore  operating margins on incremental hotel revenues approach  meaning for each additional dollar of room revenue  income from operations increases by nearly a like amount 
however  this benefit was mitigated by higher depreciation expense stemming primarily from the purchase of previously leased equipment 
on june   we exercised purchase options under our operating lease agreements  the majority of which related to equipment at mandalay bay 
the resulting additional depreciation more than offset the benefit from the elimination of operating lease rent 
see the discussion under financing activities under financial position and capital resources for additional details regarding our operating leases 
at luxor  income from operations increased million  or 
this property also benefited from the new convention center at mandalay bay  though to a lesser extent 
meanwhile  income from operations at excalibur rose million  or  and at circus circus las vegas  it increased million  or 
the contribution from the owned monte carlo rose million  or 
we believe the rebound in the national economy contributed to our higher results on the las vegas strip 
excalibur also benefited from a change in its mix of pit games and slot machines 
reno income from operations at our reno properties including our share of silver legacy was down million  or  in fiscal expanded native american gaming in california and the northwestern us was the principal factor in the decline  most notably the june opening of a significant new native american casino located in the heart of reno s principal feeder market in northern california 
laughlin our two laughlin properties  colorado belle and edgewater  posted a combined decrease in income from operations of million  or  for fiscal  despite the prior year write off of million of goodwill associated with edgewater 
like the reno market  laughlin is facing increased competition from native american casinos in its primary feeder markets in arizona and southern california 
other markets in detroit  michigan  motorcity casino generated an increase in income from operations of million  or 
depreciation expense  which decreased million  was a principal factor in this increase see discussion under depreciation and amortization  along with the million write off of an intangible asset in the prior year 
see new projects under financial position and capital resources for additional details regarding our detroit operation 
in tunica county  mississippi  income from operations at gold strike rose million  or  during fiscal increased marketing efforts at this property have increased its market share and contributed to a million  or  increase in casino revenues 
the contribution to income from operations from grand victoria our owned riverboat casino in elgin  illinois decreased million  or  in fiscal the decrease was due primarily to the impact of gaming tax increases approved by the illinois legislature  the first of which took effect july  and included a top end rate of on gaming revenues exceeding million  and a second increase that took effect july   which raised the top end rate to on gaming revenues exceeding million 
by law  the latter increase is to be repealed after a tenth casino license is awarded and the new property commences operations  or july   whichever occurs first 
the tenth casino license was recently awarded  however based upon a number of contingencies needed to finalize this tenth license  we cannot determine at this time when or whether a tenth property will commence operations 
interest expense in fiscal  interest expense decreased million 
while average debt outstanding was higher than in the prior year billion versus billion  the impact was offset by a higher proportion of less expensive variable rate debt  lower interest rates on short term borrowings  and the amortization of gains related to the termination of interest rate swap agreements 
at january   approximately of our billion debt portfolio was comprised of fixed rate obligations 
through a combination of financing transactions over the course of the year  this percentage was reduced to approximately of our billion debt portfolio at january  see also financing activities interest rate swaps and market risk and derivative financial instruments under financial position and capital resources 
capitalized interest was million in fiscal compared to million in the previous year 
capitalized interest in fiscal related primarily to thehotel and mandalay place 
for fiscal  capitalized interest related primarily to the new convention center at mandalay bay 
income taxes the effective tax rates for fiscal and fiscal were and  respectively 
these rates reflect the corporate statutory rate of plus the effect of various nondeductible expenses 
the higher effective tax rate in fiscal reflects the impact of the goodwill write offs at edgewater and railroad pass  which were not deductible for tax purposes 
for fiscal  we estimate our effective tax rate will be 
recent tax developments on june   the governor of illinois signed new tax legislation providing for an increase in tax rates on illinois gaming revenues 
under the bill  the upper tax rate on casino revenues was increased from on casino revenues exceeding million to on casino revenues exceeding million 
the legislation also provided for increased tax rates for the lower revenue tiers as well as increased boarding fees 
new tax legislation signed into law by the governor of nevada on july   increased the taxes applicable to our nevada operations and those of our nevada joint ventures 
based on our evaluation of the new nevada tax law  we believe that its impact on our income from operations will be less than million annually 
fiscal compared with fiscal results of operations earnings per share for the year ended january   we reported net income of million  or per diluted share  versus million  or 
per diluted share  for the year ended january  the increase in earnings for fiscal was due primarily to a million decrease in depreciation and amortization expense see discussion under depreciation and amortization below  which was partially offset by a related million increase in operating lease rent 
earnings in fiscal also benefitted from a million decrease in interest expense  an overall reduction in write offs related to asset impairment  goodwill impairment and intangible assets  and a decrease in the average number of diluted shares outstanding 
earnings for fiscal reflected strong results at mandalay bay and motorcity casino 
at mandalay bay  operating income surged  on the strength of cost cutting measures implemented after september   lower depreciation and amortization expense and a decline in entertainment expense due to the july closing of the storm production in the mandalay showroom 
mandalay bay also benefitted from the january  opening of the new convention center 
at motorcity casino  operating income rose despite the intangible write off discussed below  reflecting higher slot machine revenues at that property 
other factors affecting our fiscal and results included the following preopening expenses 
we recorded preopening expenses of million for fiscal and million for fiscal in both years  these expenses related primarily to the new convention center at mandalay bay that opened in january adjustments to carrying values 
at the end of each quarterly reporting period  we adjust the carrying value of investments associated with our supplemental executive retirement plan serp  a defined benefit plan for senior executives  to reflect their market value 
these noncash adjustments reflected in the interest  dividends and other income caption amounted to losses of million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
write off of intangibles 
results for fiscal reflect the write off of million of intangible costs associated with motorcity casino in detroit 
these intangible costs represent amounts paid by mandalay to its partner  atwater casino group  in exchange for a so called preference applicable to predecessors of atwater casino group to develop a casino in detroit 
in early  preferences of this nature were declared unconstitutional by a federal appeals court 
on august   motorcity signed a revised development agreement with the city of detroit which provided for the development of an expanded permanent casino on the site of the current facility 
as a result of these events  it was determined that the intangible preference had no value and should be written off

statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  became effective for mandalay on february  under sfas  goodwill is no longer amortized  but must be reviewed at least annually for impairment 
in connection with our implementation of sfas  we completed an analysis of the goodwill arising from our prior acquisitions and recorded a write off of million  representing the unamortized goodwill associated with the june  acquisition of the railroad pass hotel and casino in henderson  nevada 
this write off was reflected as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the quarter ended april  pursuant to our subsequent annual review for goodwill impairment  we recorded a write off of million that was reflected as an impairment loss in the fourth quarter of fiscal this write off represented the unamortized goodwill associated with the february  acquisition of the edgewater hotel and casino in laughlin  nevada 
it was necessitated by a decline in income from operations at that property  as well as lower future expectations attributable to the impact on the laughlin market of increased competition from native american casinos 
the effects of the above write offs were offset by the elimination of goodwill amortization in fiscal goodwill amortization in fiscal had amounted to million 
other impairment 
in fiscal  we recorded an impairment loss of million related to the write down of the carrying value of our two jean properties  gold strike and nevada landing 
this write down reflected the downturn in these properties operating results due to the continued expansion of native american casinos in california 
the write down was made in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
of the million write down  million represented goodwill 
revenues revenues increased million  or less than  for the year ended january  the increase was due to a million  or  increase in revenues at motorcity casino in detroit  michigan 
this increase was partially offset by lower revenues at our las vegas strip properties stemming from the continued effect of september  and the recession 
revenues at these properties were down million  or 
revenues also declined at our other nevada properties  mainly because of expanded native american gaming in california 
in reno  revenues decreased million  or  in laughlin they were down million  or  and in jean they were down million  or 
casino revenues casino revenues rose million  or less than  in fiscal casino revenues declined at most of our major wholly owned properties due to the continued effects of september   the economic recession and the expansion of native american gaming in california 
these declines were offset by a million  or  increase in casino revenues at motorcity casino 
hotel revenues hotel revenues fell million  or  in fiscal despite improving steadily throughout fiscal  revpar at our las vegas properties decreased from fiscal due mainly to the lingering effects of the september  attacks and the recession

other revenues rose million  or  in fiscal the continued success of blue man group at luxor largely offset the impact from the closing of storm at mandalay bay 
costs and expenses depreciation and amortization for fiscal  depreciation and amortization expense was million versus million in fiscal the million decrease was due to several factors  including new operating leases entered into in december under these new leases  we sold and leased back million of equipment  thus replacing depreciation expense and interest expense with operating lease rent 
depreciation and amortization was also lower due to a reduction of depreciation at motorcity casino 
based upon a revised development agreement entered into with the city of detroit on august   depreciation expense related to the motorcity casino facility was reduced prospectively 
previously  the cost of the temporary facility was being depreciated over its contractual operating term of four years  with the annual depreciation expense approximating million 
under the revised development agreement  the temporary facility ceases to be temporary and will be expanded as a permanent resort as opposed to the permanent resort being developed on a separate site  as was the requirement under the original development agreement 
consequently  the remaining book value of the temporary facility is being depreciated over its remaining expected life 
finally  depreciation and amortization expense also declined due to the previously discussed elimination of goodwill amortization pursuant to sfas operating lease rent operating lease rent for fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal the increase was due to the new operating leases we entered into in december the higher rent expense we incurred as a result of those leases  however  was partially offset by a reduction in rent expense related to the june renewal of the previously existing million lease facility 
income from operations for the year ended january   income from operations rose million  or  from the previous year 
the composite operating margin in fiscal was versus in fiscal income from operations for fiscal benefitted from the reduction of depreciation and amortization expense and from cost cutting measures undertaken at all of our properties following september  these benefits were partially offset by the million write off of an intangible asset at motorcity casino and the million goodwill write off at edgewater discussed earlier 
meanwhile  income from operations in fiscal was negatively affected by the previously discussed impairment loss of million related to our jean  nevada properties 
the table below summarizes our operating results by property and is followed by a discussion of operating results by market 
fye fye income from operations depreciation and amortization income from operations depreciation and amortization in millions mandalay bay luxor excalibur circus circus las vegas gold strike tunica colorado belle edgewater circus circus reno gold strike properties motorcity casino unconsolidated joint ventures other subtotal corporate expense total includes circus circus las vegas and slots a fun 
includes gold strike  nevada landing and railroad pass 
motorcity casino is owned and its operations are consolidated for financial reporting purposes 
includes monte carlo  grand victoria and silver legacy  each of which is owned 
las vegas our las vegas properties including our share of monte carlo posted an overall increase in income from operations of million  or  for fiscal at mandalay bay  income from operations rose million  or  despite flat revenues 
the main contributors to the increase at mandalay bay were the cost cutting measures implemented after september   a combined million reduction in depreciation expense and operating lease rent and a decrease in entertainment expense stemming from the july closing of the storm production in the mandalay showroom 
the preproduction costs associated with this show were fully expensed in fiscal in anticipation of the closing 
storm was replaced by the broadway hit mamma mia  which opened february  while cost cutting measures also benefitted our other las vegas properties  results were mixed 
income from operations at luxor in fiscal was up million  or  while the contribution from monte carlo increased by million  or  for the year 
however  at excalibur  income from operations was down million  or  and at circus circus it declined million  or 
these latter two properties cater primarily to the middle income market segment  which appears to have been more impacted by the continued effects of september  and the economic recession 
reno income from operations at our reno properties including our share of silver legacy was down million  or  in fiscal expanded native american gaming in california and the northwestern us contributed to the decline  as did the economic recession 
the absence from reno of a major bowling tournament in fiscal also affected our results 
however  reno is scheduled to host the men s or women s national bowling tournament in two out of every three years through fiscal laughlin our two laughlin properties  colorado belle and edgewater  posted a combined decrease in income from operations of million  or  for fiscal the decline was due to the write off of million of goodwill associated with edgewater  as discussed previously 
furthermore  like the reno market  laughlin is facing increased competition from native american casinos in its primary feeder markets in arizona and southern california 
other markets in detroit  michigan  motorcity casino generated an increase in income from operations of million  or  despite the million write off of an intangible asset discussed previously 
lower depreciation expense down million was the principal factor in this increase  though a increase in slot revenues was also a contributing factor 
in tunica county  mississippi  income from operations at gold strike increased million  or  during fiscal a rise in casino revenue  stemming from expanded marketing efforts  was largely responsible for the increase  along with cost cutting measures 
the contribution to income from operations made by grand victoria our owned riverboat casino in elgin  illinois decreased million  or  in fiscal the decrease was due primarily to a tax increase on casinos that took effect july  and included a top end rate of on gaming revenues exceeding million 
this tax increase reduced the contribution from grand victoria by million for the year 
interest expense in fiscal  interest expense decreased million 
the decrease was due primarily to a combination of lower interest rates on short term borrowings  new fixed to floating interest rate swap agreements entered into in june and august and lower average borrowings 
this reduction of interest expense was partially offset by the issuance of million principal amount of senior subordinated notes in december the net proceeds from this issuance were used to pay down lower cost borrowings outstanding under our bank facility 
on march   silver legacy issued million of mortgage notes due at the same time  silver legacy entered into a new senior secured credit facility  comprised of a million revolving credit facility and a million amortizing term loan 
the net proceeds of the notes  combined with draws under the new credit facility  were used to repay the prior credit facility million and to fund a million distribution to the silver legacy partners million of which was distributed to mandalay 
at january   long term debt including current portion stood at billion compared to billion at january  capitalized interest was million in fiscal compared to million in the previous year 
capitalized interest in both years related primarily to the new convention center at mandalay bay 
income taxes the effective tax rates for fiscal and fiscal were and 
these rates reflect the corporate statutory rate of plus the effect of various nondeductible expenses  primarily the amortization and write off of goodwill 
the higher rate in fiscal was due to the impairment loss of million  million of which represented the write off of goodwill  which is not deductible for tax purposes 
financial position and capital resources operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal versus million in fiscal and million in fiscal net cash provided by operating activities increased in fiscal due primarily to improved operating results  as net income and depreciation expense each discussed previously rose a combined million 
in addition  the tax benefit from the exercise of employee stock options increased by million in fiscal  when million options were exercised compared to million options in fiscal for tax purposes  gains recognized by employees upon the exercise of stock options are considered additional compensation expense and are therefore deductible 
these increases were partially offset by changes in working capital which occurred in the normal course of business 
the fiscal comparison was also affected by two significant items which occurred in the prior year when we received a million special distribution from silver legacy in conjunction with the restructuring of the joint venture s debt and wrote off a million intangible asset at motorcity casino as discussed previously 
for fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities increased slightly compared with fiscal the main contributors to the increase were a million rise in net income  the aforementioned special distribution from silver legacy  and the noncash write off of the motorcity intangible asset 
offsetting these items was a million decrease in depreciation and amortization stemming from the operating leases we entered into in december as well as the reduction of depreciation at motorcity casino 
mandalay had cash and cash equivalents of million at january   sufficient for normal daily operating requirements 
our cash balance has historically not been subject to significant fluctuations because we manage our cash through our revolving credit facility 
to the extent excess cash is available  it is used to repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility  and to the extent additional cash is required  we borrow funds under the facility 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal versus million in fiscal and million in fiscal investing activities related primarily to capital expenditures  which are discussed in more detail below 
in addition  in fiscal we contributed million to monte carlo that  along with a similar contribution from our partner  was used to pay off that property s revolving credit facility 
in fiscal and  we also paid amounts required under the revised development agreement in detroit 
see new projects detroit for additional details 
capital expenditures for fiscal  which were funded from a combination of cash flow and additional borrowings  totaled million 
of this amount  million related to the construction of thehotel the new all suites hotel tower at mandalay bay which opened in december  million related to the construction of mandalay place the new retail center located between mandalay bay and luxor which opened in october  and million related to the purchase of a new corporate aircraft which was funded primarily through the application of a million deposit made in fiscal 
capital expenditures for fiscal also include million related to the acquisition of equipment pursuant to purchase options we exercised under our operating lease agreements

capital expenditures for fiscal totaled million 
of this amount  million related to the construction of a new convention center at mandalay bay that opened in january  million related to the construction of thehotel  million related to the remodeling of the original suites at mandalay bay  and million related to the construction of mandalay place 
for fiscal  capital expenditures totaled million 
of this amount  million related to the construction of the new convention center at mandalay bay  million related to the completion of the renovation of the pyramid rooms at luxor  and million related to the acquisition of land adjacent to our casino facility in detroit 
we estimate that capital expenditures in fiscal will be in the range of million 
these estimated capital expenditures include primarily maintenance capital spending  which consists of items necessary to maintain the operating condition of our properties  such as new slot machines  carpeting  computers and similar equipment 
capital expenditures for fiscal will be funded primarily from cash flow  though we also have funds available under our revolving credit facility 
actual capital expenditures for fiscal may differ significantly from the estimated range  particularly if we are able to proceed with the development of an expanded permanent facility in detroit 
see new projects detroit for additional details 
financing activities for fiscal  financing activities provided net cash of million 
net borrowings provided cash of million  while proceeds from exercises of employee stock options provided an additional million 
cash was used primarily to fund the march settlement of our million equity forward agreement and to fund million in dividend payments to our shareholders 
a discussion of specific financing activities in fiscal is provided below 
for fiscal  financing activities provided net cash of million 
net borrowings provided cash of million  while proceeds from exercises of employee stock options provided an additional million 
the majority of this cash was used to purchase million shares of our common stock at a cost of million 
for fiscal  financing activities used net cash of million  of which million was used to purchase million shares of our common stock  and another million was used to fund interim settlements and interest payments under our equity forward agreements with bank of america 
see the discussion under off balance sheet arrangements equity forward agreements for more details 
credit facilities in august  we entered into a million term loan facility and an million revolving facility with members of our bank group 
each of these facilities was for general corporate purposes 
the entire amount of the term loan facility was repaid on november  using primarily proceeds from the issuance of senior notes 
see other financing transactions below 
under the revolving facility  million was outstanding at january  the revolving credit facility is unsecured and provides for the payment of interest  at our option  at either i a eurodollar based rate  or ii a rate equal to or an increment above the higher of a the bank of america prime rate  or b the federal reserve board federal funds rate plus basis points 
at january   the effective rate of interest on the indebtedness outstanding under our revolving credit facility was 
the revolving credit facility includes financial covenants regarding total debt and interest coverage  plus covenants that limit our ability to dispose of assets  make distributions on our capital stock  engage in a merger  incur liens and engage in transactions with our affiliates 
on august   the entire principal amount then outstanding under our revolving credit facility becomes due and payable  unless the maturity date is extended with the consent of the lenders 
in december  we amended the covenants under each of our credit facilities to provide for more liberal tests for total debt and interest coverage 
these amendments were obtained to address the impact of the events of september  in february  we again amended the covenants under each of our credit facilities 
these amendments modified the definition of adjusted ebitda with respect to our ownership of motorcity casino in detroit  michigan 
as previously defined in our credit facilities  adjusted ebitda included only the cash distributions we actually received from motorcity casino 
under the amended definition  adjusted ebitda includes our share of the adjusted ebitda of motorcity casino  whether or not distributed 
these amendments also provided for a more liberal test for total debt coverage during the fiscal year ended january  as of january   we were in compliance with all of the covenants in our revolving credit facility  including those related to total debt and interest coverage  and under the most restrictive covenant  we had the ability to issue additional debt of approximately million 
our borrowing capacity under these covenants can fluctuate substantially from quarter to quarter depending upon our operating cash flow 
as of january   the senior debt of mandalay resort group was rated ba by moody s investors service moody s and bb by standard poors ratings services s p 
these ratings remained stable throughout fiscal to the extent that these credit ratings change  our ability to borrow  as well as the rates at which we borrow  could be affected 
however  given our current financial position  as well as our historically strong and stable cash flows  we do not anticipate any significant changes in our credit ratings in the near term 
in addition  we do not believe our credit ratings  or changes in those ratings  have had a significant impact on our previous financing activities  or will have a significant impact on future financing activities 
convertible senior debentures on march   we issued million original principal amount of floating rate convertible senior debentures due convertible debentures 
an additional million original principal amount of the convertible debentures was issued on april   pursuant to an option granted to the initial purchasers 
the convertible debentures bear interest at a floating rate equal to month libor reset quarterly plus  subject to a maximum rate of 
the convertible debentures also provide for the payment of contingent interest after march  if the average market price of the convertible debentures reaches a certain threshold 
such contingent interest is considered an embedded derivative with a nominal value 
the convertible debentures provide for an initial base conversion price of per share  reflecting a conversion premium of over mandalay s closing stock price of on march  each convertible debenture is convertible into shares of mandalay s common stock i during any calendar quarter beginning after june   if the closing price of mandalay s common stock is more than of the base conversion price initially of  or for at least of the last trading days of the preceding calendar quarter  ii during any period in which the credit rating assigned to the convertible debentures by s p  or its successor  is at or below b or the equivalent  or if the credit rating assigned to the convertible debentures by moody s  or its successor  is at or below b or the equivalent  iii if we take certain corporate actions  or iv if we call the convertible debentures for redemption 
if the convertible debentures are converted  holders will receive shares per convertible debenture  or an aggregate of million shares of mandalay common stock  subject to adjustment of the conversion rate for any stock dividend  any subdivision or combination  or certain reclassifications  of the shares of our common stock  any distribution to all holders of shares of our common stock of certain rights to purchase shares of our common stock for a period expiring within days at less than the sale price per share of our common stock at the time  any distribution to all holders of shares of our common stock of our assets including shares of capital stock of a subsidiary  debt securities or certain rights to purchase our securities  or any extraordinary cash dividend 
for this purpose  an extraordinary cash dividend is one the amount of which  together with all other cash dividends paid during the preceding month period  is on a per share basis in excess of the sum of i of the sale price of the shares of our common stock on the day preceding the date of declaration of such dividend and ii the quotient of the amount of any contingent cash interest paid on a convertible debenture during such month period divided by the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of a convertible debenture at the conversion rate in effect on the payment date of such contingent cash interest 
in addition  if at the time of conversion the market price of mandalay s common stock exceeds the then applicable base conversion price  holders will receive up to an additional shares of mandalay s common stock per convertible debenture  as determined pursuant to a specified formula  or up to an additional million shares in the aggregate 
we may redeem all or some of the convertible debentures for cash at any time on or after march   at their accreted principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any  to  but not including  the redemption date 
at the option of the holders  we may be required to repurchase all or some of the convertible debentures on the th  th  th  th and th anniversaries of their issuance  at their accreted principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any  to  but not including  the purchase date 
we may choose to pay the purchase price in cash  shares of mandalay common stock or any combination thereof 
we issued these debentures because they carry a much lower interest rate relative to other financing alternatives  which contributed to lower interest expense in fiscal  and which we expect to contribute to lower interest expense in the future 
in addition  the proceeds from this issuance were used to repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility  which creates additional capacity under that facility and  in turn  provides overall greater financial flexibility 
interest rate swaps in february  we entered into two reverse interest rate swap agreements fair value hedges with members of our bank group 
under one agreement  we received a fixed interest rate of and paid a variable interest rate based on libor plus on million notional amount 
under the other  we received a fixed rate of and paid a variable interest rate based on libor plus on million notional amount 
in may  we elected to terminate the million swap and received million in cash  representing the fair market value of the swap 
accounting rules require such gains to be treated as debt premium and amortized over the remaining life of the related debt instrument using an effective interest method 
however  since the underlying million senior subordinated notes were called on july   the unamortized portion of this gain along with the unamortized portion of the gain related to a similar interest rate swap that was terminated in october was offset against the related loss on early retirement of debt 
the total gain thus offset was million 
meanwhile  in june  we elected to terminate the million swap 
we received million in cash  representing the fair market value of this swap  and recorded a corresponding debt premium which will be amortized to interest expense over the then remaining life of the related debt instrument  which was approximately years 
in july  we entered into two reverse interest rate swap agreements fair value hedges with members of our bank group 
under one agreement  we received a fixed interest rate of and paid a variable interest rate based on libor plus on million notional amount 
under the other agreement  we received a fixed rate of and paid a variable interest rate based on libor plus on million notional amount 
these swaps were being used to hedge our million senior notes due in march  we elected to terminate both of the above swaps  pursuant to which we received million in cash representing the fair market value of these swaps  and recorded a corresponding debt premium which will be amortized to interest expense over the remaining life of the related debt instrument  which was approximately years 
the company had an interest rate swap agreement cash flow hedge of million notional amount  which terminated on september  in december  we entered into two reverse interest rate swap agreements fair value hedges with members of our bank group 
under one agreement  we receive a fixed interest rate of and pay a variable interest rate based on libor plus on million notional amount 
under the other  we receive a fixed rate of and pay a variable interest rate based on libor plus on million notional amount 
these swaps are being used to hedge our million senior notes due in april  we entered into a reverse interest rate swap agreement fair value hedge with a member of our bank group 
under this agreement  we receive a fixed interest rate of and pay a variable interest rate based on libor plus on million notional amount 
this swap is being used to hedge our million senior notes due we entered into the above swap agreements  which met the criteria established by the financial accounting standards board for hedge accounting  in order to further manage our interest expense and achieve a better balance of variable to fixed rate debt in our debt portfolio 
including the effect of interest rate swaps  approximately of our debt outstanding at january  was variable rate 
this compares to approximately at january  while we believe the company is currently better served by maintaining a higher proportion of less expensive variable rate debt  we continue to monitor and evaluate current economic conditions  along with the company s financial condition  and may adjust the percentage of variable rate debt in the future  as we consider appropriate 
other financing transactions on june   we exercised our options under two operating lease agreements relating to equipment located at several of our nevada properties  and purchased the equipment for a total purchase price of million  representing the equipment s estimated fair market value based on independent appraisals 
simultaneously  we entered into a new lease agreement pursuant to which we assigned a portion of the equipment acquired above to the new lessors and borrowed million 
these proceeds  along with borrowings under our revolving credit facility  were used to fund the purchase of the equipment under the previous operating leases 
the new lease agreement is considered a capital lease for financial reporting purposes  and we recorded an asset and a corresponding liability equal to the fair market value of the assets at inception of the lease 
an option to borrow up to an additional million under the new lease agreement expired december  the new lease agreement contains financial covenants regarding total debt and interest coverage that are similar to those under our revolving credit facility 
the agreement also contains covenants regarding equipment maintenance  insurance requirements and prohibitions on liens 
as of january   we were in compliance with all of the covenants in this lease agreement 
we elected to terminate our operating lease agreements in order to replace them with equally priced and more transparent financing ie  reflected on our balance sheet 
note the discussion under investing activities above indicated that we had incurred capital expenditures of million related to the purchase of the equipment under our operating lease agreements 
this amount differs from the million reported above due to million of unamortized deferred gain related to the december operating lease transaction 
this deferred gain was reversed when the purchase option was exercised 
on july   we repaid our million senior subordinated notes due july   using borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
on july   we called our million senior subordinated notes due at a call price of using borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
as a result of utilizing less expensive debt to call these notes  we expect to significantly reduce the related interest expense over the two year term that would have otherwise remained on the notes 
on july   we issued million senior notes due the net proceeds were used to repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
we issued these notes in order to take advantage of low interest rates in the bond market and to replenish capacity under our revolving credit facility 
on november   we redeemed million of our million aggregate principal amount of debentures due pursuant to the holders one time option  which was funded utilizing borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
on november   we issued million senior notes due the net proceeds  together with borrowings under our revolving credit facility  were used to permanently repay in full our million term loan facility 
as previously discussed  we hedged these notes by entering into swap agreements pursuant to which we pay a composite floating rate of libor plus  slightly below the libor plus rate we were paying on the term loan facility 
thus  by issuing these notes we effectively extended the original july maturity date for this indebtedness to november dividends on june   mandalay s board of directors instituted a policy of quarterly cash dividends 
the following table sets forth the cash dividends declared payment date record date dividend per share august  june

new projects thehotel thehotel  the new  all suites tower at mandalay bay  opened in december the new suites average square feet  among the largest room product in the las vegas market 
the story tower also includes meeting suites  a spa and fitness center  a lounge and two restaurants  including a rooftop venue mix las vegas created by famed chef alain ducasse that will open later this summer 
the total cost of the new tower is estimated to be million  excluding land  capitalized interest and preopening expenses 
as of january   we had incurred costs of million related to this project 
mandalay place in october  we opened mandalay place  a retail center located between mandalay bay and luxor 
the center will eventually include approximately  square feet of retail space and approximately stores and restaurants  including internationally branded retailers like oilily  gf ferre  nike golf and urban outfitters  along with restaurants by celebrity chefs pierro selvaggio  hubert keller and rick moonen 
the cost is estimated to be approximately million  excluding land  capitalized interest and preopening expenses 
as of january   we had incurred costs of million related to this project 
detroit we participate with the detroit based atwater casino group in a joint venture that owns and operates a casino in detroit  michigan 
this joint venture is one of three groups which negotiated casino development agreements with the city of detroit 
we have a ownership interest in the joint venture 
on august   the detroit city council approved a revised development agreement between the joint venture and the city of detroit the revised development agreement 
under the revised development agreement  motorcity casino is to be expanded into a permanent facility at its current location by december  the permanent facility is currently expected to include  square feet of casino space  a room hotel  a  seat theater  convention space  and additional restaurants  retail space and parking 
depending upon market conditions  the availability of additional land and the joint venture s ability to obtain reasonable financing  the joint venture could be required to construct an additional rooms 
under the terms of this agreement  the joint venture had paid the city a total of million as of january  and is obligated to pay an additional million by may also  beginning january   the joint venture is to pay the city of its adjusted casino revenues 
if its casino revenues top million in any given calendar year  the payment will be increased to for that calendar year 
originally  the joint venture s permanent facility was to have been located on land along the detroit river 
the city s economic development corporation issued bonds to finance the city s acquisition of that land  and bank of america issued letters of credit totaling million to secure and ultimately make the payments of principal and interest on those bonds 
we then issued letters of credit totaling million to back bank of america s letters of credit 
we will continue to provide such letters of credit 
as part of the revised development agreement  the joint venture will forego the right to receive any of the riverfront land acquired by the city  and will transfer to the city its interest in certain real property previously purchased by the joint venture and the other casino developers 
both the joint venture and mandalay are subject to a radius restriction prohibiting them from operating additional casinos within approximately miles of detroit  so long as the laws of the state are not amended to permit more than three casinos within the radius 
additionally  the joint venture is required to indemnify the city for up to million in claims against the city in connection with the acquisition of the riverfront land and in connection with the lac vieux litigation described below 
we have committed to contribute of the costs of the permanent facility in the form of an investment in the joint venture 
the joint venture will seek to borrow any additional funds above mandalay s equity contribution which may be necessary to complete the expanded permanent facility 
under our operating agreement  the project costs are to be reviewed every six months 
as of january   we had contributed of the project costs as most recently determined 
the cost of the additional facilities excluding land  capitalized interest and preopening expenses is currently estimated to be million 
under the revised development agreement  we have guaranteed completion of the expanded facility and have entered into a keep well agreement with the city that could require us to contribute additional funds to continue operation of the expanded facility until august  there is no contractual limitation on the amount that we may be required to contribute under our completion guarantee or to keep the project operating until august  however  based on the performance of the casino to date  we do not expect that these obligations will require the outlay of additional capital 
the joint venture s million credit facility matured june  we had guaranteed this credit facility 
under the terms of the joint venture s operating agreement  mandalay is to receive a management fee for a period of ten years equal to of the cost of the permanent casino facility 
the management committee of the joint venture initially determined that mandalay was entitled to the management fee commencing on the date the revised development agreement was signed  since that agreement provided for the existing facility to become the permanent facility 
the management committee ultimately determined that the management fee should not be paid until the permanent casino expansion is completed 
as a result  we reversed previously accrued management fee income of million in the second quarter ended july  various lawsuits have been filed in the state and federal courts challenging the constitutionality of the casino development competitive selection process ordinance and the michigan gaming control and revenue act  and seeking to appeal the issuance of a certificate of suitability and casino license to motorcity casino 
a decision by the sixth circuit court of appeals in lac vieux desert band of lake superior chippewa indians v 
the michigan gaming control board et al 
held that the ordinance in its current form was unconstitutional and remanded the case to the district court 
the michigan gaming control board mgcb took the ruling of the sixth circuit court of appeals under advisement without comment 
the district court declared that the ordinance in its current form is unconstitutional and awarded the lac vieux band attorneys fees and costs totaling  but rejected the lac vieux band s request to require a rebidding of the three casino licenses  and in addition  rejected the lac vieux band s request to enjoin the city of detroit from entering into revised development agreements with the three casino developers  including motorcity casino 
the lac vieux band has appealed the district court s decision to the sixth circuit court of appeals 
the sixth circuit court of appeals issued an opinion granting the lac vieux band s motion for an injunction pending appeal  that temporarily enjoins the city of detroit from issuing building permits for the permanent casino facilities and temporarily enjoins the casino developers from commencing construction of the permanent casino facilities 
the lac vieux band has filed a separate action in the gogebic county  michigan  circuit court entitled lac vieux desert band of lake superior chippewa indians v 
michigan gaming control board  in which the lac vieux band has requested the circuit court to enter an order requiring the mgcb to revoke the casino licenses issued to the three detroit casinos  including motorcity casino 
the action has been stayed pending resolution by the sixth circuit court of appeals of the lac vieux band s appeal of the district court decision referenced above 
on november   we announced that motorcity casino had signed a settlement agreement with the lac vieux desert band of lake superior chippewa indians 
on april   the district court approved the settlement 
the appeal period has not yet expired and the injunction remains in place 
upon entry of a final order in that case and in the related litigation  motorcity will pay to the lac vieux tribe million  plus attorney s fees 
motorcity will pay an additional million approximately days after the first payment 
under the terms of the settlement agreement  motorcity will pay an additional million on the first and second anniversaries of the first payment and million annually for years  beginning on the third anniversary 
the occurrence of certain events would suspend  lower and or terminate the payments 
there can be no assurance as to when final resolution will occur with respect to this matter  or what action the courts might take 
these payments would satisfy the joint venture s obligations under the indemnity agreement described above with respect to lac vieux litigation claims 
however  the joint venture would still be liable for claims related to the acquisition of the riverfront land  which potentially are capped at million 
in a separate action  on february   john ren filed suit in the circuit court of wayne county  michigan  against the detroit joint venture and the other two casino operators in detroit 
the plaintiff purports to represent himself and a class consisting of all persons who lost money and or incurred debts that remain unpaid at any of the three detroit casinos 
relying on the sixth circuit court of appeals lac vieux decision  the plaintiff alleges that the three casinos have been operating illegally and continue to do so 
the relief sought by the plaintiff includes an injunction to restrain the three casinos from remaining open until properly licensed  compensatory damages  and disgorgement of all profits unjustly obtained 
the court dismissed this action on the basis that the plaintiff should first seek relief from the mgcb 
the plaintiff filed a claim with the mgcb  but has not pursued the claim 
the joint venture continues to operate motorcity casino 
any future adverse ruling by the courts in the above lawsuits or in other lawsuits  or any adverse ruling by the mcgb  could affect the joint venture s operation of its current facility  as well as its ability to retain its certificate of suitability and casino license for its expanded permanent facility 
no assurance can be given regarding the timing or outcome of any of these proceedings 
the joint venture s operation of motorcity casino is subject to ongoing regulatory oversight  and its ability to proceed with an expanded hotel casino project is contingent upon the receipt of all necessary governmental approvals  successful resolution of pending litigation and satisfaction of other conditions 
share purchases on march   we purchased million shares under our equity forward agreements for million discussed more fully under off balance sheet arrangements 
in march  the board of directors authorized the purchase of up to million shares of our common stock that remain outstanding after we fully utilized our prior share purchase authorizations 
we made no additional share purchases during fiscal  and as of january   the number of shares we were authorized to purchase was approximately million 
any share purchases we may make in the future will be dependent upon cash flow  borrowing capacity and market conditions  and are expected to be made in accordance with the volume and other limitations of rule b under the securities exchanges act of liquidity we have various obligations including the following i existing cash obligations  ii capital commitments on projects under way as well as capital commitments and other obligations relating to the proposed expansion of our detroit joint venture property see new projects  and iii payment of dividends to the holders of our common stock 
we believe we have sufficient capital resources to meet all of the above obligations  as well as provide for additional strategic purchases of our common stock or investments in new projects 
this belief is based upon i our historically strong and dependable operating cash flows  ii the availability of borrowings under our revolving credit facility  and iii the ability to raise funds in the debt and equity markets 
under our revolving bank facility  which expires august  we had million of borrowing capacity available as of january   of which we could then utilize approximately million under the most restrictive of our loan covenants 
our borrowing capacity under these covenants can fluctuate substantially from quarter to quarter depending upon our operating cash flow 
off balance sheet arrangements commitments related to our detroit joint venture we are committed to contribute of the cost of the permanent facility in the form of an investment in the detroit joint venture 
the cost of the permanent facility is to be evaluated each january and july the timing and the amount of the required equity contribution cannot be determined at this time 
we have guaranteed completion of our joint venture s expanded permanent facility 
if we contribute additional amounts pursuant to this guarantee  there will be no proportionate increase in our ownership of the detroit joint venture 
the amount we may be required to contribute under this guarantee has no contractual limit and cannot be determined at this time 
we have entered into a keep well agreement with the city of detroit that could require us to contribute additional funds  to the extent needed  to continue operation of the permanent facility through august  if we contribute additional amounts pursuant to this guarantee  there will be no proportionate increase in our ownership of the detroit joint venture 
the amount we may be required to contribute under this agreement has no contractual limit and cannot be determined at this time 
under the revised development agreement dated august   the joint venture is required to indemnify the city of detroit for up to million in claims against the city in connection with the acquisition of riverfront land and in connection with the lac vieux litigation 
see the preceding discussion under detroit for additional details 
we entered into the above arrangements as part of our negotiations with the city of detroit related to the operation of our detroit joint venture 
operating leases in october  we entered into a million operating lease agreement with a group of financial institutions to lease equipment at mandalay bay 
in december  we entered into a series of sale and leaseback agreements covering equipment located at several nevada properties 
these agreements  also made with a group of financial institutions  totaled million 
we entered into the above operating leases solely to provide greater financial flexibility under the covenants in our bank credit facilities 
the rent expense related to these operating leases was reported separately in the consolidated statements of income as operating lease rent
