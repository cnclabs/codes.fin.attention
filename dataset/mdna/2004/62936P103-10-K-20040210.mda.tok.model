overview our objective is to build a profitable biopharmaceutical company by discovering  developing and commercializing small molecule drugs and recombinant proteins 
our current product candidates are primarily for the treatment of bone and mineral disorders  gastrointestinal disorders and central nervous system disorders 

table of contents our product pipeline consists of product candidates in various stages of clinical development and preclinical development 
one of our product candidates  cinacalcet hcl  is the subject of a new drug application  or nda  that has been filed with the united stated food and drug administration fda by our corporate licensee  amgen inc  and is the subject of a similar application filed with the european agency for the evaluation of medicinal products emea in europe 
we have completed a pivotal phase iii clinical trial with another product candidate  preos 
the data from this study are being collected and finalized and we have commenced preparation of an nda to be filed with the fda 
additional product candidates  teduglutide  formerly referred to as alx  and isovaleramide  formerly referred to as nps  are in phase ii clinical trials 
preos  teduglutide  and isovaleramide are proprietary to and are being developed by us 
preos is our brand name for our recombinant  full length parathyroid hormone that we are developing for the treatment of osteoporosis 
teduglutide is our analog of glucagon like peptide that we are developing for the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders such as short bowel syndrome and crohn s disease 
isovaleramide is a small organic molecule that we are developing for the treatment of migraine 
cinacalcet hcl  our orally active  small molecule compound for the treatment of hyperparathyroidism  is being developed by our licensees  amgen inc and kirin brewery company  ltd 
additional phase i clinical development programs include calcilytic compounds for the treatment of osteoporosis  and delucemine  formerly referred to as nps  for acute treatment of major depressive disorder 
the calcilytic compounds are licensed to and are being developed by glaxosmithkline 
we have entered into collaborative research  development and license agreements with astrazeneca ab  glaxosmithkline and janssen pharmaceutica nv  a subsidiary of johnson johnson  with respect to certain of our product development programs 
we have incurred cumulative losses from inception through december  of approximately million  net of cumulative revenues from research and license agreements of approximately million 
we expect to continue to incur significant operating losses over at least the next several years as we continue our current and anticipated development projects  particularly our clinical trial programs for preos  teduglutide  isovaleramide and delucemine  as we maintain our contractual commitment to fund research activities in our metabotropic glutamate receptor program  and as we develop marketing  sales and manufacturing capabilities 
major research and development projects our major research and development projects involve preos and teduglutide 
we also have other research and development efforts in central nervous system disorders 
preos 
preos is our brand name for recombinant  full length  human parathyroid hormone that we are developing for the treatment of osteoporosis 
we have completed dosing of patients with preos in a pivotal phase iii clinical trial  referred to as the top study 
we designed this trial to demonstrate preos ability to reduce fractures and build new bone in women with osteoporosis 
we are also conducting other clinical trials with preos to support the filing of an nda with the fda 
we anticipate filing an nda for preos for the treatment of osteoporosis at the end of the third quarter of during the years ended december   and we incurred million  million  and million  respectively  in the research and development of this product candidate  including costs associated with the manufacture of clinical and commercial supplies of preos 
we have incurred costs of approximately million since we acquired this product candidate with our acquisition of allelix biopharmaceuticals inc allelix in december our development administration overhead costs are included in total research and development expense for each period  but are not allocated among our various projects 
the goal of our preos development program is to obtain marketing approval from the fda  and analogous international agencies  and we will consider the project substantially complete if we obtain those approvals even though subsequent to that time we might incur additional expenses in conducting additional clinical trials and follow up studies 
to obtain the first of such approvals  we plan to file an nda with the fda at the conclusion of our phase iii trials  assuming that the clinical trials results support a filing 
we have completed dosing of all patients that participated in our pivotal  month phase iii trial for preos 
we expect to report results of this study by the end of the first quarter of we are also conducting other clinical trials with preos to support an eventual nda 
assuming successful completion of the phase iii trials  we anticipate filing an nda for the treatment of osteoporosis at the end of the third quarter of because of the ongoing work with respect to the phase iii trials  the preparation and filing of the nda  the fda review process  the initiation of commercial manufacturing activities  the preparations for sales and marketing  and the risks associated with the clinical trial approval process  including the risk that we may have to repeat  revise or expand the scope of trials or conduct additional clinical trials not presently planned to secure marketing approvals and the additional risks identified herein  we are unable to estimate the costs to completion or the completion date for the preos program 
material cash inflows relating to our preos development program will not commence until after marketing approvals are 
table of contents obtained  and then only if preos finds acceptance in the marketplace 
to date  we have not received any revenues from product sales of preos 
the risks and uncertainties associated with completing the development of preos on schedule  or at all  include the following preos may not be shown to be safe and efficacious in the phase iii trials  we may be unable to obtain regulatory approval of the drug or be unable to obtain such approval on a timely basis  our ability to secure adequate clinical and commercial supplies of preos in order to complete the phase iii clinical trials and initiate commercial launch upon approval  our ability to prepare and file an nda with the fda  and we may not have adequate funds to complete the development of preos 
a failure to obtain marketing approval for preos  secure adequate clinical and commercial supplies of preos  or to timely complete development and obtain regulatory approval would likely have the following results on our operations  financial position and liquidity we would not earn any sales revenue from preos  which would increase the likelihood that we would need to obtain additional financing for our other development efforts  and our reputation among investors might be harmed  which might make it more difficult for us to obtain equity capital on attractive terms or at all 
because of the many risks and uncertainties relating to the completion of clinical trials  receipt of marketing approvals and acceptance in the marketplace  we cannot predict when material cash inflows from this program will commence  if ever 
teduglutide 
teduglutide is an analog of glucagon like peptide  a naturally occurring hormone that regulates proliferation of the cells lining the small intestine 
we are independently developing teduglutide for the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders such as short bowel syndrome and crohn s disease 
we have completed a phase ii study in adults with short bowel syndrome 
the drug appeared to be safe and well tolerated in this study 
we are preparing to initiate a pivotal study for adults with short bowel syndrome 
we expect to commence this study in early a proof of concept clinical study to evaluate the possible utility of teduglutide in the treatment of patients with crohn s disease was commenced in october our development administration overhead costs are included in total research and development expense for each period  but are not allocated among our various projects 
during the years ended december   and  we incurred million  million and million  respectively  in the research and development of this product candidate  including costs associated with the manufacture of clinical and commercial supplies of teduglutide 
we have incurred costs of approximately million since we acquired this product candidate with our acquisition of allelix in december the goal of our teduglutide development program is to obtain marketing approval from the fda  and analogous international agencies  and we will consider the project substantially complete if we obtain those approvals even though subsequent to that time we might incur additional expenses in conducting additional clinical trials and follow up studies 
before we can obtain such marketing approvals we will need to complete pivotal clinical trials with satisfactory results and submit a nda to the fda 
because of the ongoing work with respect to the pivotal trial in adults with short bowel syndrome  the early stage of the clinical trials in crohn s disease  and the risks associated with the clinical trial process  including the risk that we may repeat  revise or expand the scope of future trials or conduct additional clinical trials not presently planned to secure marketing approvals and the additional risks identified herein  we are unable to estimate the costs to completion or the completion date for the teduglutide program 
because of the many risks and uncertainties relating to the completion of clinicals trials  receipt of marketing approval from the applicable regulatory agency and acceptance in the marketplace  the availability of sufficient funds to complete development of the product  we cannot predict when material cash inflows from our teduglutide program will commence  if ever 
to date  we have not received any revenues from 
table of contents product sales of teduglutide 
the risks and uncertainties associated with completing the development of teduglutide on schedule  or at all  include the following teduglutide may not be shown to be safe and efficacious in the pivotal clinical trials  we may be unable to obtain regulatory approval of the drug or be unable to obtain such approval on a timely basis  our ability to continue to be able to secure adequate clinical and commercial supplies of teduglutide in order to complete the pivotal clinical trials and initiate commercial launch upon approval  and we may not have adequate funds to complete the development of teduglutide 
a failure to obtain marketing approval for teduglutide or to timely complete development and obtain regulatory approval would likely have the following results on our operations  financial position and liquidity we would not earn any sales revenue from teduglutide  which would increase the likelihood that we would need to obtain additional financing for our other development efforts  and our reputation among investors might be harmed  which might make it more difficult for us to obtain equity capital on attractive terms or at all 
central nervous system disorders most of the remaining research and development expenses for the three years ended december   and were generated by various early clinical stage programs  pre clinical studies and drug discovery programs  including our clinical development efforts with isovaleramide and delucemine and our collaboration with astrazeneca in metabotropic glutamate receptors mglurs described below 
isovaleramide 
isovaleramide is a proprietary small organic molecule compound we formerly referred to as nps we are independently developing this compound for the acute treatment of migraine 
we have initiated a phase iia clinical trial with isovaleramide to evaluate the compound s potential as an acute therapy for migraine headaches 
the double blind  placebo controlled trial is designed to assess the effectiveness of a single oral administration of a low dose or a high dose of isovaleramide in the relief of migraine pain and associated systems  such as nausea and sensitivity to light or sound 
our preclinical studies show that isovaleramide is effective in a number of animal models of epilepsy and spasticity 
we have completed several phase i clinical trials with isovaleramide to evaluate its safety and tolerability and its ability to be delivered in a controlled release formulation 
our analysis of the data indicates that the drug was safe and well tolerated 
initial formulation studies demonstrated that the compound is amenable to multiple controlled release formulation technologies 
we are presently working to identify a controlled release formulation to take into further clinical trials for the treatment of epilepsy 
our development  administration  overhead costs are included in total research and development expenses for each period  but are not allocated among our various projects 
during the years ended december   and  we incurred million   and  respectively in research and development of this product candidate  including costs associated with the manufacture of clinical supplies of isovaleramide 
the goal of our isovaleramide development program is to obtain marketing approval from the fda  and analogous international agencies  and we will consider the project substantially complete if we obtain those approvals even though subsequent to that time we might incur additional expenses in conducting additional clinical trials and follow up studies 
before we can obtain such marketing approvals we will need to complete pivotal clinical trials with satisfactory results and submit a nda to the fda 
because of the early stage of the clinical trials in the acute treatment of migraine  and the risks associated with the clinical trial process  including the risk that we may repeat  revise or expand the scope of future trials or conduct additional clinical trials not presently planned to secure marketing approvals and the additional risks identified herein  we are unable to estimate the costs to completion or the completion date for the teduglutide program 
because of the many risks and uncertainties relating to the completion of clinicals trials  receipt of marketing approval from the applicable regulatory agency and acceptance in the marketplace  the availability of sufficient funds to complete development of the product  we cannot predict when material cash inflows from our isovaleramide program will commence  if ever 
to date  we 
table of contents have not received any revenues from product sales of isovaleramide 
the risks and uncertainties associated with completing the development of isovaleramide on schedule  or at all  include the following isovaleramide may not be shown to be safe and efficacious in the pivotal clinical trials  we may be unable to obtain regulatory approval of the drug or be unable to obtain such approval on a timely basis  our ability to continue to be able to secure adequate clinical and commercial supplies of isovaleramide in order to complete the pivotal clinical trials and initiate commercial launch upon approval  and we may not have adequate funds to complete the development of isovaleramide 
a failure to obtain marketing approval for teduglutide or to timely complete development and obtain regulatory approval would likely have the following results on our operations  financial position and liquidity we would not earn any sales revenue from isovaleramide  which would increase the likelihood that we would need to obtain additional financing for our other development efforts  and our reputation among investors might be harmed  which might make it more difficult for us to obtain equity capital on attractive terms or at all 
metabotropic glutamate receptor program 
since  we have been working to find compounds that act on targets in the central nervous system called metabotropic glutamate receptors  or mglurs 
we have discovered a number of compounds that activate or inhibit mglurs and that are highly selective for specific subtypes of mglurs 
our animal studies with a number of these compounds have demonstrated their potential as drug candidates for the treatment of central nervous system disorders such as psychiatric and neurologic disorders 
in march  we entered into an agreement with astrazeneca under which we collaborate exclusively in an extensive program around a number of mglur subtypes 
we granted astrazeneca exclusive rights to commercialize mglur subtype selective compounds 
under our agreement  we are required to co direct the research and pay for an equal share of the preclinical research costs  including capital and a minimum number of personnel  through march unless earlier terminated by astrazeneca or us upon six months advance written notice 
if certain milestones are met  astrazeneca is required to pay us up to million 
astrazeneca is also required to pay us royalties on sales of products that include those compounds 
we have the right to co promote any resulting product in the united states and canada and to receive co promotion revenue  if any 
should we elect to co promote products  in some circumstances we will be required to share in the development and regulatory costs associated with those products  and we may not receive some late stage milestone payments 
during the three years ended december   and  we incurred million  million and million  respectively  in research and development expenses under our collaboration with astrazeneca 
material cash inflows in the form of royalties relating to this collaboration will not commence until after marketing approvals are obtained  and then only if the product finds acceptance in the marketplace 
no product candidates have yet entered clinical trials 
in order to obtain marketing approval  we will need to complete phase i  ii and iii clinical trials with satisfactory results and submit a nda to the fda 
because of this  and the substantial risks and uncertainties relating to the completion of clinical trials  receipt of marketing approvals and acceptance in the marketplace  we cannot predict when material cash inflows from our collaboration with astrazeneca will commence  if ever 
delucemine for major depressive disorder 
delucemine  formerly referred to as nps  is a novel compound for which we originally pursued development for the treatment of stroke 
this compound targets nmda receptor operated calcium channels that are activated by the neurotransmitter glutamate 
the compound also has appreciable activity as a serotonin reuptake inhibitor 
published research has suggested that glutamate may play a role in the development of depression 
we believe delucemine may produce a rapid antidepressant effect in patients suffering from major depressive order 
delucemine does not appear to exhibit the side effects that have plagued other nmda receptor antagonists 
delucemine  at neuroprotective or antidepressant doses in preclinical animal models  caused no pcp like behavioral effects  no learning or memory impairment  no neuronal vacuolization  and no significant sedation or cardiovascular side effects 
we expect to commence a clinical study for delucemine for the treatment of acute and urgent symptoms of major depressive disorders in the second half of 
table of contents during the three years ended december   and  we incurred million   and  respectively  in research and development of this product candidate 
other programs for central nervous system disorders 
we collaborated with janssen on glycine reuptake inhibitors to identify prospective drug candidates for schizophrenia and dementia 
janssen has now assumed full responsibility for the development of product candidates identified under the collaboration 
we are not expending any significant resources in the program 
in november we received a milestone payment from janssen as a result of the selection of a preclinical compound for further development as a potential treatment for schizophrenia 
we will receive additional milestone payments of up to million from janssen  if certain milestones are met  and royalties on sales of any drugs developed or sold by janssen under this collaboration agreement 
the goal of these central nervous system programs is to discover  synthesize and obtain marketing approval for product candidates 
material cash inflows will not commence until after marketing approvals are obtained  and then only if the product finds acceptance in the marketplace 
currently all compounds are in pre clinical stages or early clinical stages 
in order to obtain marketing approval  we will need to initiate and complete phase i  ii and iii clinical trials with satisfactory results and submit a nda to the fda 
because of this  and the many risks and uncertainties relating to the completion of clinical trials  receipt of marketing approvals and acceptance in the marketplace  we cannot predict when material cash inflows from these projects will commence  if ever 
results of operations revenues 
substantially all our revenues have come from license fees  research and development support or milestone payments from our licensees and collaborators 
these revenues fluctuate from year to year 
our revenues were million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
the increase in revenues from to is primarily the result of a million milestone payment we received from amgen inc for the submission of a new drug application to the united states food and drug administration fda for cinacalcet hcl in september and a million milestone payment we received from glaxosmithkline for the initiation of a clinical study with a new calcilytic compound 
additionally  we recognized million in revenue during as a result of our settled arbitration with forest laboratories  inc relating to a milestone owed to us 
the decrease from to is primarily due to the recognition of milestone payments from our licensees amgen  kirin  forest  and janssen in that did not recur in we recognized revenue from our agreements as follows under our agreement with glaxosmithkline  we recognized million in   in and  in  under our agreement with kirin  we recognized no revenue in each of and and million in  under our agreement with amgen  we recognized million in  no revenue in and million in  under our agreement with janssen  we recognized no revenue in each of and and million in  under our terminated agreement with forest  we recognized million in  no revenue in and million in  and under our recently terminated research funding agreement with the government of canada  we recognized no revenue in  million in and million in see liquidity and capital resources below for further discussion of payments that we may earn in the future under these agreements 
research and development 
our research and development expenses arise primarily from compensation and other related costs of our personnel who are dedicated to research and development activities and from the fees paid and costs reimbursed to outside professionals to conduct research  clinical studies and trials  and to manufacture drug compounds and related supplies prior to fda approval 
our research and development expenses increased to 
table of contents million in from million in and million in research and development expenses increased from to principally due to a million increase in the costs of advancing the development of our preos program  including personnel related costs  a million increase in the costs of advancing the development of our teduglutide program  a million increase in costs associated with the manufacture of clinical and commercial supplies of preos  and a million increase in the costs related to advancing our central nervous system programs 
research and development expenses increased from to principally due to an million increase in the costs of advancing the development of our preos program  a million increase in the costs of advancing the development of teduglutide  and an million increase in costs associated with the manufacture of clinical and commercial supplies of preos and teduglutide 
general and administrative 
our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of the costs of our management and administrative staff  business insurance  taxes  professional fees and market research and promotion activities for our product candidates 
our general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in and million in the increase in general and administrative expenses from to is due primarily to a million increase in costs related to marketing activities associated with preos and teduglutide and the hiring of additional marketing personnel  a million increase in administrative costs  including hiring additional administrative personnel with related benefits and costs  and million non cash compensation charge related to the intrinsic value of modified stock options upon the retirement of certain individuals 
the increase in general and administrative expenses from to was due primarily to a million increase in costs associated with increased marketing activities for preos and the hiring of additional marketing personnel 
amortization of goodwill and purchased intangibles 
goodwill and purchased intangibles originated with our december acquisition of allelix biopharmaceuticals  inc allelix 
the remaining intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization  at december  totaled approximately million 
amortization of goodwill and acquired intangibles decreased from million in to million in and million in the decrease in and is the result of our adoption of the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  on january  sfas no 
eliminated the amortization of goodwill 
during we recorded amortization expense of million  or  per basic and diluted share  that would not have been recorded under sfas no 
merger costs and termination fees 
merger costs and termination fees were million for the year ended december  as a result of the termination of our merger with enzon pharmaceuticals  inc enzon and the termination of our agreement with the government of canada pursuant to the technology partnerships canada program tpc 
on february  we entered into an agreement and plan of reorganization merger agreement with enzon  which set forth the terms and conditions of the proposed merger of nps and enzon 
on june   we announced that nps and enzon had mutually agreed to terminate the merger agreement and other ancillary documents entered into in connection with the merger agreement 
as part of the agreements to terminate the merger  we paid enzon a termination fee in the form of a private placement of million shares of our common stock valued at million based upon the per share closing price of our common stock on the nasdaq national market on june  a shelf registration statement on form s  providing for the resale of these shares by enzon was filed with the securities and exchange commission on july  we also incurred direct costs relating to the proposed merger of approximately million 
in december  we reached an agreement to mutually terminate our contract with the government of canada under its tpc program 
as a result  we concluded that it was probable that we would have to repay amounts previously paid by tpc under this agreement and to write off receivables due from tpc 
in exchange for mutual releases  we paid million to the government of canada 
additionally  we released tpc from all outstanding reimbursement obligations  resulting in the write off of million in accounts receivable 
we are relieved of any further or continuing obligations related to the development or commercialization of teduglutide 
we are continuing our clinical work with this compound for the treatment of various gastrointestinal disorders 
in process research and development acquired 
we recorded an expense of million in for in process research and development that we acquired as part of our purchase of allelix 
the acquired in process research and development consisted of five drug development programs  of which preos  for osteoporosis  and teduglutide  for gastrointestinal disorders  accounted for percent of the total value 
since the date of the acquisition  we revised our plans for the next series of clinical trials for preos and teduglutide 
we have completed dosing of all patients that participated in our pivotal  month phase iii trial for preos 
we have also completed a pilot phase ii clinical trial with teduglutide in adults with short bowel syndrome 
table of contents and have initiated a phase ii proof of concept clinical study in patients for the treatment of crohn s disease 
since the date of acquisition and through december   we have incurred total costs of approximately million for preos and million for teduglutide 
total costs include all costs associated with the programs including all clinical development costs  manufacturing costs  outside legal and patent costs  personnel costs  and marketing related costs 
total costs and time to completion for each of these product candidates will depend on the costs we incur to conduct current clinical trials and to perform any additional work we find necessary to obtain fda approval 
we believe the assumptions we used in the valuation of the in process research and development we acquired from allelix were reasonable at the time of the acquisition 
however  we have modified our development plans as new data have become available regarding each product candidate 
accordingly  actual results may vary from the projected results in the valuation 
total other income  net 
our total other income  net  decreased from million in to million in the decrease from to was primarily the result of a recording interest expense of million in on our million of outstanding convertible notes due additionally  interest income decreased  primarily the result of lower interest rates during as compared to our total other income  net  decreased from million in to million in the decrease from to is mainly the result of decreased interest income of million and decreased gain on sale of marketable investment securities of million  both the result of lower interest rates and lower average cash  cash equivalents  and marketable investment security 
balances of cash  cash equivalent and marketable investment securities during the fiscal year ended december  decreased as a result of the need to fund current operations  however  we were able to increase our cash  cash equivalent and marketable investment securities in the fourth quarter of due to proceeds we received from a public offering of million shares of our common stock  which was completed in october additionally during  we recognized income of million from equity method investments and recognized only  from equity method investments in income taxes our income tax benefit was million in and  in as compared to expense of  in we recorded an income tax benefit of million during for refundable income tax credits relating to research and development activities in the canadian province of quebec 
the amount recorded in represents our estimate of amounts we believe are probable of being received and retained by us 
prior to  we were not able to estimate or conclude that it was probable that we would receive and retain amounts related to this credit 
as of december   we had a united states federal income tax net operating loss carryforward of approximately million and a united states federal income tax research credit carryforward of approximately million 
we also had a canadian federal and provincial income tax net operating loss carryforward of approximately million and million  respectively  a canadian research pool carryforward of approximately million and a canadian investment tax credit carryforward of approximately million 
our ability to utilize the united states operating loss and credit carryforwards against future taxable income will be subject to annual limitations in future periods pursuant to the change in ownership rules under section of the internal revenue code of liquidity and capital resources we require cash to fund our operating expenses  to make capital expenditures  acquisitions and investments  and to pay debt service 
we have financed operations since inception primarily through payments received under collaborative research and license agreements and the private and public issuance and sale of equity securities  and the issuance and sale of convertible debt 
as of december   we had recognized million of cumulative revenues from payments for research support  license fees and milestone payments  million from the sale of equity securities for cash and million from the sale of convertible debt for cash 
our principal sources of liquidity are cash  cash equivalents  and marketable investment securities  which totaled million at december  the primary objectives for our marketable investment security portfolio are liquidity and safety of principal 
investments are intended to achieve the highest rate of return to us  consistent with these two objectives 
our investment policy limits investments to certain types of instruments issued by institutions with investment grade credit ratings and places restrictions on maturities and concentration by type and issuer 

table of contents our cash  cash equivalents  and marketable investment securities totaled million as of december   as compared to million as of december   and million as of december  the increase from and to in total cash  cash equivalents  and marketable investment securities was primarily the result of our sale of million of our convertible notes due  which was completed in july we received net proceeds of million from this private placement after deducting debt issuance costs 
the notes bear interest at an annual rate of percent 
interest is payable on june and december of each year beginning december  accrued interest on the notes was approximately  as of december  the holders may convert all or a portion of the notes into common stock at any time on or before june  the notes are convertible into our common stock at a conversion rate equal to approximately per share  subject to adjustment in certain events 
the notes are unsecured senior debt obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness 
on or after june   we may redeem any or all of the notes at a redemption price of percent of their principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest to the day preceding the redemption date 
the notes will mature on june  unless earlier converted  redeemed at our option or redeemed at the option of the noteholder upon a fundamental change  as described in the note indenture 
neither we nor any of our subsidiaries are subject to any financial covenants under the indenture 
in addition  neither we nor any of our subsidiaries are restricted under the indenture from paying dividends  incurring debt  or issuing or repurchasing our securities 
net cash used in operating activities was million in  million in and million in net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  of million resulted from a net loss of million  realized gains and non cash expense of million  a decrease in operating assets of  and an increase in operating liabilities of million

net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december  was primarily the result of net proceeds from the sale of marketable investment securities to fund operations 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was primarily the result of investing the net proceeds from our public stock offering in november net cash provided by financing activities was million in  million in  and million in net cash provided by financing activities in is primarily the result of cash proceeds from the sale of convertible debentures totaling million  net  in september net cash provided by financing activities in is primarily the result of cash proceeds from the sale of common stock from our public offering totaling million  net  in october we could receive future milestone payments of up to million in the aggregate if each of our current licensees accomplishes the specified research and or development milestones provided in the respective agreements 
in addition  all of the agreements require the licensees to make royalty payments to us if they sell products covered by the terms of our license agreements 
however  we do not control the subject matter  timing or resources applied by our licensees to their development programs 
thus  potential receipt of milestone and royalty payments from these licensees is largely beyond our control 
some of the late stage development milestone payments from astrazeneca will not be due if we elect a co promotion option under which we may commercialize products 
further  each of these agreements may be terminated before its scheduled expiration date by the respective licensee either for any reason or under certain conditions 
we have entered into certain research and license agreements that require us to make research support payments to academic or research institutions when the research is performed 
additional payments may be required upon the accomplishment of research milestones by the institutions or as license fees or royalties to maintain the licenses 
as of december   we have a total commitment of up to million for future research support and milestone payments 
further  depending on the commercial success of certain of our products  we may be required to pay license fees or royalties 
for example  we are required to make royalty payments on teduglutide net sales 
we expect to enter into additional sponsored research and license agreements in the future 
under our agreement with astrazeneca  we are required to co direct the research and pay for an equal share of the preclinical research costs  including capital and a minimum number of personnel through march unless earlier terminated by astrazeneca or us upon six months advance written notice 
additionally  we have 
table of contents entered into long term agreements with certain manufacturers  contract research organizations  and suppliers that require us to make contractual payment to these organizations 
as of december   we have outstanding commitments under these agreements of approximately million 
in february  we initiated discussions with certain contract research organizations to pursue mutually acceptable adjustments to the terms of the respective agreements 
as these negotiations are still ongoing  the ultimate outcome of these negotiations is uncertain 
however  any adjustments which are agreed to will impact the amount of commitments to be paid in the future 
we expect to enter into additional collaborative research  contract research  manufacturing  and supplier agreements in the future  which may require up front payments and long term commitments of cash 
the following represents the contractual obligations of the company as of december  in millions contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating leases purchase commitments convertible notes payable in december  we executed a ground lease for land in the research park of the university of utah in salt lake city  utah and have commenced construction of a  square foot building consisting of laboratory  support and administrative support 
we expect construction costs to be approximately million with a completion date by the first quarter of additionally  in january  we signed a binding term sheet with the mars discovery district in downtown toronto  ontario concerning the lease of approximately  square feet of laboratory  support and administrative space 
the term of the lease is ten years and eight months with a commencement date of november  no payments are required during the first eight months of the lease term followed by an annual base rent commitment of approximately  through june  leasehold improvement costs are expected to be approximately million  commencing in late and being complete in we expect that our existing capital resources including interest earned thereon  will be sufficient to allow us to maintain our current and planned operations through mid however  our actual needs will depend on numerous factors  including the progress and scope of our internally funded research  development and commercialization activities  our ability to comply with the terms of our research funding agreements  our ability to maintain existing collaborations  our decision to seek additional collaboration  the success of our collaborators in developing and marketing products under their respective collaborations with us  our success in producing clinical supplies of our product candidates on a timely basis sufficient to meet the needs of our clinical trials  the costs we incur in obtaining and enforcing patent and other proprietary rights or gaining the freedom to operate under the patents of others  and our success in acquiring and integrating complementary products  technologies or businesses 
our clinical trials may be modified or terminated for several reasons including the risk that our product candidates will demonstrate safety concerns  the risk that regulatory authorities may not approve our product candidates for further development or may require additional or expanded clinical trials to be performed  and the risk that our manufacturers may not be able to supply sufficient quantities of our drug candidates to support our clinical trials  which could lead to a disruption or cessation of the clinical trials 
we do not have on hand sufficient supplies of our product candidates to meet all of our clinical trial requirements and we are dependent on outside manufacturers to provide these supplies on a timely basis 
we currently have sufficient clinical supplies of preos to complete those clinical studies to be included in our nda filing  but have not yet produced sufficient quantities of preos to meet all of our clinical trial needs 
if any of the events that pose these risks comes to fruition  we may have to substantially modify or terminate current and planned clinical trials  our business may be materially harmed  our stock price may be adversely affected  and our ability to raise additional capital may be impaired 
we need to raise substantial additional funds to support our long term research  product development  and commercialization programs 
we regularly consider various fund raising alternatives  including  for example  partnering of existing programs  monitizing of potential revenue streams  debt or equity financing and merger and acquisition alternatives 
we may also seek additional funding through strategic alliances  collaborations  or license agreements and other financing mechanisms 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of  or eliminate one or more of our research and development programs  or to obtain funds through arrangements with licensees or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies or product candidates that we may otherwise seek to develop or commercialize on our own

 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
allocation of revenue to individual elements which qualify for separate accounting is based on the estimated fair value of the respective elements 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill 
we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
our balance sheet reflects net intangible assets of million  long lived assets of million  and goodwill of million as of december  when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles and long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
to date  we have not determined the existence of any indication of impairment sufficient to require us to adjust our historical measure of value of such assets

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
our interest rate risk exposure results from our investment portfolio and our convertible notes 
our primary objectives in managing our investment portfolio are to preserve principal  maintain proper liquidity to meet operating needs and maximize yields 
the securities we hold in our investment portfolio are subject to interest rate risk 
at any time  sharp changes in interest rates can affect the fair value of the investment portfolio and its interest earnings 
after a review of our marketable investment securities  we believe that in the event of a hypothetical ten percent increase in interest rates  the resulting decrease in fair market value of our marketable investment securities would be insignificant to the financial statements 
currently  we do not hedge these interest rate exposures 
we have established policies and procedures to manage exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 
we place our investments with high quality issuers and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
table of contents and do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we invest in highly liquid  investment grade securities and money market funds of various issues  types and maturities 
these securities are classified as available for sale and  consequently  are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as accumulated other comprehensive income as a separate component in stockholders equity 
our percent convertible notes in the principal amount of million due june  have a fixed rate 
the fair value of the convertible notes is affected by changes in the interest rates and by changes in the price of our common stock 
foreign currency risk 
we have research and development operations are in canada 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as a change in the foreign currency exchange rate between the us dollar and the canadian dollar  or by weak economic conditions in canada 
when the us dollar strengthens against the canadian dollar  the cost of expenses in canada decreases 
when the us dollar weakens against the canadian dollar  the cost of expenses in canada increases 
the monetary assets and liabilities in our foreign subsidiary which are impacted by the foreign currency fluctuations are cash  marketable investment securities  accounts receivable  accounts payable  and certain accrued liabilities 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the canadian dollar from the december  rate would cause the fair value of such monetary assets and liabilities in canada to change by an insignificant amount 
we are not currently engaged in any foreign currency hedging activities
