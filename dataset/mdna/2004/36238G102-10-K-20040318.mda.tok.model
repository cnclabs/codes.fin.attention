critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions 
we have identified the following as critical accounting polices  which are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  are the most pervasive and important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues from product sales or services provided when the following revenue recognition criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the selling price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenue from product sales  net of estimated returns based on historical experience and current trends  upon shipment of products to customers 
we ship the majority of products from our fulfillment center in louisville  ky 
in fiscal  we also shipped products from ashford 
com s jewelry and luxury goods fulfillment center that we formerly maintained in houston  tx 
we also rely upon certain vendors to ship products directly to customers on our behalf 
we act as principal in these transactions  as orders are initiated directly through the e commerce businesses that we operate  we take title to the goods at the shipping point and have the economic risk related to collection  customer service and returns 
we consider the criteria presented in eitf  no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  in determining the appropriate revenue recognition treatment 
generally  when we are the primary obligor in a transaction  have general inventory risk  have established the selling price  have discretion in supplier selection  have physical loss inventory risk after order placement or during shipping and have credit risk  or have several but not all of these indicators  we record revenue gross as a principal 

table of contents we pay a percentage of the revenues generated from the sale of products through the e commerce businesses that we operate to our respective partners in exchange for the rights to use their brand names and the promotions and advertising that our partners agree to provide 
we refer to these royalty payments as partner revenue share charges 
we have considered the revenue reduction provisions addressed in eitf no 
 vendor income statement characterization of consideration paid to a reseller of the vendor s products  which was codified in eitf no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer or a reseller of the vendor s products  and believe that the payment of partner revenue share charges  or the issuance of warrants or stock in lieu of cash partner revenue share charges  to our partners should not result in any reduction of revenues 
eitf no 
addresses consideration paid to parties along a distribution chain 
we purchase merchandise from our vendors  at our discretion  and we are responsible for paying those vendors 
the amounts purchased and the prices paid to our vendors are not impacted by the revenue share provisions of our agreements with our partners 
accordingly  our partners and our vendors are not linked in the distribution chain and we believe that the provisions of eitf no 
do not apply 
we recognize revenue from services provided as the services are rendered 
if we receive payments for services in advance  these amounts are deferred and then recognized over the service period 
deferred revenue consists primarily of fees paid to us in advance as of the respective balance sheet date under an agreement to manage certain aspects of a partner s overall e commerce business  including fulfillment  technology and customer service 
deferred revenue also consists of amounts received from the sale of gift certificates redeemable through our partners e commerce businesses 
accounting for inventory inventory  primarily consisting of sporting goods  athletic equipment  footwear  apparel and consumer electronics  is valued at the lower of cost or market 
inherent in this valuation are significant management judgments and estimates  including among others  assessments concerning obsolescence and shrinkage rates 
based upon these judgments and estimates  which are applied consistently from period to period  we record valuation allowances to adjust the carrying amount of our inventory 
we record a charge for obsolescence based upon  among other factors  the amount of inventory which has an aging of greater than one year and the anticipated mark downs required to sell the inventory in the normal course of business 
we record a charge for inventory shrinkage for damages and other losses based on rates experienced in our fulfillment center 
accounting for long lived assets the ability to realize long lived assets is evaluated periodically as events or circumstances indicate a possible inability to recover their carrying amount 
such evaluation is based on various analyses  including undiscounted cash flow and profitability projections that incorporate  as applicable  the impact on the existing business 
the analyses necessarily involve significant management judgment 
any impairment loss  if indicated  is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset 
accounting for stock based compensation we account for stock options granted to employees under our incentive and non incentive stock option plans using the intrinsic method prescribed in accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
accordingly  compensation expense for stock options issued to employees is measured as the excess  if any  of the quoted market price of our stock at the date of the grant over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock 

table of contents we account for stock options and warrants issued to non employees using the fair value method prescribed in sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and in accordance with the provisions of eitf no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services  and eitf no 
 accounting recognition for certain transactions involving equity instruments granted to other than employees 
accordingly  compensation expense for stock options and warrants issued to non employees is measured using a black scholes multiple option pricing model that takes into account significant assumptions as to the expected life of the option or warrant  the expected volatility of our common stock and the risk free interest rate over the expected life of the option or warrant 
we also record stock based compensation as deferred partner revenue share charges are amortized 
these deferred partner revenue share charges  which are included in other assets  have resulted from the exercise of a right to receive  shares of our common stock in lieu of future cash revenue share payments  and were million and million as of the end of fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the deferred partner revenue share charges are amortized as the revenue share expense is incurred based on actual revenues recognized in a given period and the imputed partner revenue share percentage  which is based on the value of the company s common stock that was issued upon exercise of the right 
accounting for restructuring costs restructuring costs  which include termination benefits  contractual obligations  asset impairments and other restructuring costs are recorded at estimated fair value 
key assumptions in calculating the restructuring costs included the timing of employee terminations and estimates of the expected salvage value of assets held for disposal 
we review these reserves periodically and adjust them as necessary 
liquidity and capital resources our principal source of liquidity is our cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and marketable securities 
our cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and marketable securities balances were million and million as of the end of fiscal and fiscal  respectively

table of contents we had the following contractual obligations as of the end of fiscal payments due by period total less than year years years more than years in thousands operating lease obligations purchase obligations employment agreements advertising and media agreements partner revenue share payments long term debt obligations capital lease obligations total contractual obligations purchase obligations are defined as agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable pricing provisions and the approximate timing of the transactions 
these obligations relate primarily to commitments to purchase inventory 
to date  we have financed our e commerce operations primarily from the sale of equity securities 
management expects that our current cash and the collection of accounts receivable will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for the foreseeable future 
while in the fourth quarter of fiscal we realized net income of million and in the fourth quarter of fiscal we realized net income of  we did not realize net income for the full years of fiscal  fiscal or fiscal while we do expect to realize net income in fiscal  in order to fund our anticipated operating expenses and realize income  our revenues must increase significantly 
if cash flows are insufficient to fund our expenses  we may need to raise additional funds in future periods through public or private debt or equity financings or other arrangements to fund our operations until we achieve profitability 
failure to raise future capital when needed could seriously harm our business and operating results 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities  the percentage ownership of our current stockholders would be reduced to the extent they did not participate in that financing 
furthermore  these equity securities might have rights  preferences or privileges senior to our common stock 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have not used derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we invest our excess cash in institutional money market accounts  auction rate certificates  us government agencies  corporate bonds and auction preferred stock 
in order to minimize risk and credit exposure  we invest with three financial institutions 
we protect and preserve our invested funds by limiting default  market and reinvestment risk 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or it may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates
