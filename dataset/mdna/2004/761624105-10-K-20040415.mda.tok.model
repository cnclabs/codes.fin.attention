our comparable store sales declined   and for fiscal  and  respectively 
we believe our comparable store sales have been adversely affected by the economy  price deflation in certain categories and the increasing competitive environment 
we consider a store to be comparable after it has been open six full fiscal quarters 
comparable store sales comparisons do not include sales of extended service contracts 
extended service contracts our extended service contract revenues  net of sales commissions  are deferred and amortized on a straight line basis over the life of the contracts after the expiration of applicable manufacturers warranty periods

this partnership is now operational and producing synthetic fuel 
the irs has notified the parent company of the general partner of somerset of its intention to audit the synthetic fuel operations of the parent company s subsidiaries as part of its normal audit program for the parent company 
the tax credits applied to reduce tax expense were approximately million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
on september   we closed on the purchase of a plant located in gillette  wyoming designed and constructed for the production of synthetic fuel  which qualifies for tax credits under section of the internal revenue code 
we obtained a private letter ruling from the internal revenue service  which would allow the disassembly  and reconstruction  of the facility 
we incurred approximately million of direct cost on this project  with approximately an additional  being held in escrow to guarantee our contractual obligation 
on march   we sold our membership interest in the limited liability company that owned the gillette facility to an outside party

we had no borrowings outstanding on the line of credit at january  at january   we had borrowings outstanding of million 
a total of approximately million was available at january   net of letters of credit outstanding of million at that time 
we currently have only one letter of credit outstanding for  borrowing levels vary during the course of a year based upon our seasonal working capital needs 
the maximum direct borrowings outstanding during fiscal were approximately million 
the weighted average interest rate was including commitment fees for fiscal the revolving credit agreement contains restrictive covenants which require us to maintain specified levels of consolidated tangible net worth and limit capital expenditures and the incurrence of additional indebtedness

tabular disclosure of contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business  the company enters into agreements under which it is obligated to make legally enforceable future cash payments

the fourth fiscal quarter accounted for and of net sales and and of income from operations in fiscal and  respectively 
year to year comparisons of quarterly results of operations and comparable store sales can be affected by a variety of factors  including the duration of the holiday selling season  weather conditions and the timing of new store openings 
impact of inflation the impact of inflation has not been material to our results of operations for the past three fiscal years 
critical accounting policies we believe the application of the following accounting policies  which are important to our financial position and results of operations  require significant assumptions  judgments and estimates on the part of management 
we base our assumptions  judgments and estimates on historical experience  current trends and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared 
however  because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty  actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates  and such differences could be material 
further  if different assumptions  judgments and estimates had been used  the results could have been different and such differences could be material 
for a summary of all of our accounting policies  including the accounting policies discussed below  see note of the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize sales of products upon receipt by the customer 
we will honor returns from customers within seven days from the date of sale 
we establish liabilities for estimated returns at the point of sale 
we also sell product service contracts covering periods beyond the normal manufacturers warranty periods  usually with terms of coverage including manufacturers warranty periods of between to months 
contract revenues  net of sales commissions  are deferred and amortized on a straight line basis over the life of the contracts after the expiration of applicable manufacturers warranty periods 
we retain the obligation to perform warranty service and such costs are charged to operations as incurred 
we recognize amounts billed to a customer for shipping and handling as revenue and actual costs incurred for shipping as selling  general and administrative expense in the income statement 
vendor allowances vendors often fund  up front  certain advertising costs and exposure to general changes in pricing to customers due to technological change 
allowances are deferred as received from vendors and recognized into income as an offset to the cost of merchandise sold when the related product is sold 
advertising costs are expensed as incurred  with no offset of vendor allowances 
inventory reserves inventory is recorded at the lower of cost or market  net of reserves established for estimated technological obsolescence 
the market value of inventory is often dependent upon changes in technology resulting in significant changes in customer demand 
if these estimates are inaccurate  we may be exposed to market conditions that require an additional reduction in the value of certain inventories affected 
income taxes income taxes are recorded based on the current year amounts payable or refundable  as well as the consequences of events that give rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences in how those events are treated for tax purposes  net of valuation allowances 
we base our estimate of deferred tax assets and liabilities on current tax laws and rates and other expectations about future outcomes  including the outcome of tax credits under section of the internal revenue code 
changes in existing regulatory tax laws and rates may affect our ability to successfully manage regulatory matters  and future business results may affect the amount of deferred tax liabilities or the valuation of deferred tax assets over time 
our accounting for deferred tax consequences represents management s best estimate of future events that can be appropriately reflected in the accounting estimates 
recoverability of long lived assets given the nature of our business  each income producing property must be evaluated separately when events and circumstances indicate that the value of that asset may not be recoverable 
we recognize an impairment loss when the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its value upon disposal are less than its carrying amount 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board issued a revised fasb interpretation no 
 entitled  consolidation of variable interest entities 
as revised  the new interpretation requires that the company consolidate all variable interest entities in its financial statements under certain circumstances 
the company will adopt the revised interpretation for our interim period ending april   as required  and does not expect the interpretation to have a material effect on the financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of january   we had financial instruments which were sensitive to changes in interest rates 
these financial instruments consist of a revolving credit agreement and various mortgage notes payable secured by certain land  buildings and leasehold improvements 
the revolving credit agreement is with six banks through july   with interest at prime or libor plus and commitment fees of payable on the unused portion 
amounts available for borrowing are equal to the lesser of million for the months of january through june and million for the months of july through december or the sum of specific percentages of eligible accounts receivable and eligible inventories  as defined 
amounts available for borrowing are reduced by any letter of credit commitments outstanding 
borrowings on the revolving credit agreement are secured by certain fixed assets  accounts receivable  inventories and the capital stock of our subsidiaries 
at january   a total of approximately million was available for borrowings under the revolving credit agreement  net of letters of credit outstanding of million 
we had no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit agreement at january  approximately million of the mortgage debt consists of fixed rate debt 
the interest rates range from to 
the remaining million of mortgage debt is variable rate mortgage debt 
in general  the rate on the variable rate debt ranges from prime to prime plus 
if the prime interest rate increased  we estimate our annual interest cost would increase approximately million for the variable rate mortgage debt 
principal and interest are payable monthly over terms which generally range from to years 
substantially all of the notes payable require balloon payments at the end of the scheduled term 
the fair value of our long term fixed mortgage debt at january  was approximately million 
the fair value was estimated based on rates available to us for debt with similar terms and maturities
