item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
also see item management s discussion analysis our relationships with visa and target have brought significant value to the company 
catuity s license agreement with visa provides a cross license for us to use in our base product many of the features developed specifically for visa and target 
this is significant because catuity believes it has the leading real time loyalty software system in the industry 
in addition to our own expertise  the valuable experience and input from two of the industry s leaders visa usa and target corporation assures future catuity customers that the system is robust and can work on a large scale basis in the marketplace 
there are few  if any  competitors who can make the same claim 
a significant aspect of the development of the system for the visa target launch was the creation by visa usa of a software support group  consisting of representatives from three of the entities involved in the visa smart rewards program 
in addition  visa usa has contracted with catuity for other support activities not directly related to the smart rewards 
catuity is currently working to transition from project related work to more long term development and support for generic tools and infrastructure 
catuity also has a partner relationship with visa international and mastercard international to explore opportunities for payment card based loyalty programs in a number of international regions 
catuity has successfully integrated its system with the new vs visa applet intended to be used internationally for value added applications on visa chip payment cards 
this system was demonstrated and deployed in a closed loop pilot system at visa international headquarters in mid catuity continues to engage in discussions with mastercard international and its worldwide financial members 
catuity now offers technology choices  marketing support and critical flexibility to mastercard members 
catuity is a member of the mastercard vendor program mvp and the catuity system supports the multos platform 
mastercard in conjunction with oberthur has successfully integrated the catuity system into their standard value added micro chip application mods and demonstrated catuity s loyalty software at cartes in paris  france 
both of these efforts coincide with the global effort to move all payment cards to chip based emv europay  mastercard  visa standards and will drastically increase the number of smart payment cards outside of the us market 
though the initial thrust for the emv standard is to use chip technology to reduce fraud  many within the payment industry feel that other types of applications need to be part of this initiative  and most importantly loyalty is being given a high priority 
depending on the business case and customer infrastructure  loyalty programs can be accessed using either the credit card s chip or the magnetic stripe 
emv compliance in the uk must be complete by the end of and most other regions in the world by the end of though the us is looking at a timeframe much later in the decade 
our discussions with visa and mastercard and their member financial institutions around the world are on going

first  we compete with companies that provide software for customer incentive and loyalty programs for retail store locations or for internet merchants 
second  some retail software hardware providers  transaction processors  and others who provide services to merchants may also provide basic loyalty and gift card applications that the merchant can use 
we expect competition to increase as companies expand their offerings of customer incentive and loyalty programs and provide software for retail stores and the internet 
our ability to compete depends upon many factors  including our ability to successfully market our product s features  the effectiveness of our solution relative to the product offerings of our competitors  our ability to continually expand the credibility of our product in the marketplace  our ability to sell to strategically important merchants  card issuers and processors  our ability to continue to attract and retain channel partners who will sell our product  and the timeliness of our product enhancements from our product development efforts 
we believe our unique product features and strong north american market position with the largest companies in the payment industry provides us with some significant competitive advantages 
the broad functionality in our software provides our customers with flexibility in offering the type s of reward programs that suit their particular needs 
since programs are easily established and changed within our system  merchants can initiate different programs as their needs change

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following is a summary of the consolidated operating results of catuity  inc and contains forward looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results and the timing of certain events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements 
refer to the section entitled forward looking statements at the beginning of this form k for a full discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with forward looking statements 
results of operations overview of significant activities catuity s business catuity designs  develops  licenses and supports loyalty software that enables its customers retailers  transaction processors  product suppliers and card issuing banks to establish and administer a broad range of incentive and loyalty programs that are completely customizable to meet their unique needs 
our system functions in both in store as well as internet e commerce environments and works with all methods of consumer payment existing magnetic stripe credit or debit cards  chip cards  rfid  gift cards  or cash 
catuity operations overall  our revenue grew by approximately million  or over to approximately million 
was the first year we earned a significant percentage of our total revenue from license fees 
a total of approximately million  or of revenue came from license fees compared to  in license revenue in was primarily from our software installations at visa usa and target corporation 
as a result of the growth in our revenue and our on going cost control efforts  the company s loss in was reduced to approximately  from a loss of approximately million in our ability to record license revenue is highly dependent on the timing with which our customers begin using our loyalty software in a production mode and follows what may be a lengthy period of time that customers require in order to be ready for such use 
the speed with which our customers progress with their plans  how broadly they launch their loyalty initiatives  and how successful they are with their loyalty programs can all have a significant impact on our license revenue in any particular year 
as a result  license revenue in cannot be considered an indicator of future years license revenue levels or trends 
we anticipate that license revenue in the first six months of will be less than in based on our understanding of our customers current plans 
in we recorded approximately  of license revenue related to the use of our software by visa usa and target corporation 
in february  target corporation advised us that they intend to phase out the use of smart chip technology over the next twelve months 
as a result  we do not expect to record additional license revenue from the smart visa rewards platform in and beyond 
in  approximately million  or  of our total revenue was for software development and support services for visa and target 
in  due to the phasing out of smart chip technology by target  we anticipate that software development and support services related to the smart visa rewards platform for these two customers will be approximately  this is approximately million less than we had anticipated in we have established very good working relationships with both visa and target over the past three years 
we hope to continue to work with both target and visa as they each develop their future plans for the use of loyalty software 
we are currently examining strategies we can execute to minimize the impact of the revenue decline on our bottom line 
in may  the company and mr 
david macsmith  its australian based executive chairman  agreed not to renew mr 
macsmith s employment services agreement when it expired in june all of catuity s operations  other than product development  had successfully been transitioned to the us in prior years and were being managed out of the us as a result  the need for a full time executive chairman based in australia had been substantially reduced over time 
following mr 
macsmith s resignation  mr 
duncan pf mount was elected as the company s non executive chairman of the board 
total expenses decreased by approximately  or  in compared to the reductions were primarily related to reductions in salary and related costs  travel  and outside professional services in and are further described below 
the costs related to the company s severance arrangements with mr 
macsmith were expensed in in the fourth quarter of  we began developing the next generation of our loyalty software product 
this effort is expected to continue into mid and involves converting the host portion of our software to java enterprise edition jee 
once completed our software will be able to work on various hardware  operating systems and database platforms making it more appealing to prospective customers and easier to customize and maintain 
patents in december  we received the notice of allowance for our second us patent 
it was formally issued in march bringing the company s total number of issued patents to in the u 
s  in australia and in new zealand 
in addition  we have patents pending in the us  canada  brazil  european union japan 
the patent issued in the us in is particularly important because of its scope involving our unique methods of data storage on smart cards 
we believe our patents help us meet our strategy of protecting our intellectual property  protecting our customers interests  and staying on the cutting edge of technology in our markets

liquidity and capital resources capital raised in in march  following shareholder approval at a special meeting of shareholders  we received approximately  from the purchase of  shares of catuity stock by boom australia pty 
ltd  the family trust of mr 
duncan pf mount  a non executive director of catuity 
the purchase was part of the private placement the company completed in november to two other accredited investors 
at the same special shareholder meeting  shareholders also approved the establishment of our executive director stock purchase plan under which the company s executive directors may elect to use payroll deferrals to purchase catuity stock at fair market value the closing price on the last day of trading each month 
during  the company s executive directors elected to have ten percent of salary deducted for the purpose of routinely purchasing shares in the company at the end of each month 
in addition  the company s officers also elected to have ten percent of their salary deducted to purchase shares at fair market value the closing price on the last trading day of each month under the company s executive stock purchase plan 
these two plans provide a way of increasing our executive director and officer holdings in the company and further aligning their interests with those of our shareholders 
the plans do not provide any discount to our share price in the open market 
rather  they allow the executive directors and officers to increase their catuity holdings via a routine month end purchase of shares from the cash compensation that each participant defers on a pre determined basis during each month 
the participants did not receive any increase in compensation to participate in the plans 
by mid november  all shares available in the executive stock purchase plan had been purchased and the plan  in accordance with the plan document  was terminated 
both of the company s executive directors and all four of its officers participated in the plans beginning on september  and during as of december   the company had received approximately  from their participation in the plans 
in july  we concluded a private placement of  shares of the company s common stock in australia to seven accredited investors at a price of aud per share usd based on the foreign exchange rate in effect on the date of the transaction 
the price represented an discount to the shares fair market value on the australian stock exchange asx on the transaction date 
the shares were issued in two tranches the first on july  for  shares the maximum permitted under asx listing rules prior to receiving shareholder approval and the second for  shares on september  following shareholder approval at a special meeting of shareholders on september  a placement fee of of the purchase price was paid to the placement agent for both tranches 
the second tranche of shares included  shares sold to mr 
duncan pf mount  chairman of the company 
the net proceeds from all of the placement shares totaled approximately million and were added to our general working funds to be used for general operating purposes 
the shares were sold without registration under us securities laws pursuant to an exemption from such registration 
sources and uses of cash as a result of the equity raised in  we began with a cash balance of approximately  and a current ratio current assets divided by current liabilities of over to we have no debt and expenses in total are expected to be below the  required in in  we used approximately  of cash from operating activities 
the principal difference in cash used  compared to the approximate  loss from operations  is from the recording of approximately  of license revenue in that had been paid by customers prior to the timing of our license revenue recognition in was in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states us gaap and is the primary reason cash flow varied significantly from our loss for the year 
cash used in investing activities in totaled  which is a  increase from the investment of  in most of the increase in related to an increase in the exchange rate between the australian and us dollar from december  to december  over half of the company s long lived assets are in australia 
excluding the foreign currency effect  purchases increased approximately  in compared to purchases in included the purchase of software licenses to facilitate automated testing of our system  updating of older computer equipment for developers in australia  and the purchase of various computer software development licenses in the us the company  throughout its history  has been a net user of cash and we anticipate that we will experience negative cash flow in as well 
the company believes that its existing capital resources  combined with collected revenues  are adequate to meet its cash requirements for the next twelve months 
we do not have any contractual obligations that require the use of cash and no other material cash requirements other than operating expenses 
the company may need to raise equity capital again in in order to maintain cash reserves and equity reserves in accordance with nasdaq listing requirements 
as of december   the company had net operating tax loss carry forwards of  expiring in various amounts in and in the united states and  of net operating tax loss carry forwards in australia 
utilization of the net operating loss carry forwards in australia are subject to either the continuity of ownership test or the continuation of same business test at the time the losses are utilized in accordance with subdivision and subdivision of the australian income tax assessment act of utilization of the net operating loss carry forwards in the united states are subject to limits due to continuity of ownership tests under section if the internal revenue service code 
critical accounting policies and assumptions the accompanying consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
when more than one accounting principle  or the method of its application is generally accepted  we select the principle or method that is appropriate in our specific circumstances see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
application of these accounting principles requires us to make estimates about the future resolution of existing circumstances 
as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
in preparing these financial statements  we have made our best estimates and judgments of the amounts and disclosures included in the consolidated financial statements  giving due regard to materiality 
accounts receivable the company records an allowance against gross accounts receivable to provide for doubtful accounts 
the allowance is estimated based on the age of the receivable  specific circumstances surrounding the collection of an invoice  and historical data on allowances as a percentage of aged accounts receivable balances 
actual collection on accounts may differ from the allowance the company has estimated 
revenue recognition as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  the company has three distinct revenue streams license revenue  software development revenue  and service revenue 
by the end of the second quarter of  the company had recognized approximately of the million in license revenue that was recorded in license revenue is recognized in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  which provides for recognition of revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery and acceptance of the software has occurred  no essential undelivered elements remain on the company s part that are essential to the functionality of the delivered software  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collection has either occurred or is probable 
billings in excess of revenue are recorded as deferred revenue until revenue recognition criteria are met 
sop generally requires revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements to be allocated to each element based on the relative fair value of each element 
revenue recognized from multiple element arrangements is allocated to undelivered elements of the arrangement  such as maintenance  based on the relative fair value of each element 
the company s determination of fair value of each element in multi element arrangements is based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe 
the company limits its assessment of vsoe for each element to either the price charged when the same element is sold separately or the price established by management for an element not yet sold separately 
the company has established vsoe for maintenance services 
the company generally does not provide for a right of return in its license contracts 
software development revenue includes integration  customization and development fees of both the customer s hardware and software and the company s software 
software development revenue is generally billed on a fixed price basis 
the company recognizes revenue on fixed price contracts on the proportional performance method in accordance with sab  revenue recognition in financial statements  and sab  revenue recognition  based on hours incurred as a proportion of estimated total hours of the respective project 
the cumulative impact of any revisions in estimated total revenues and direct contract costs are recognized in the period in which they become known 
revenue in excess of billings is recognized as unbilled receivables and is included in work in process in the consolidated balance sheet 
billings in excess of revenue are recorded as deferred revenue until revenue recognition criteria are met 
service revenue includes training  consulting  installation support  post installation support and maintenance fees 
training  consulting  installation support and post installation support are generally billed on a time and material basis and revenue is recognized as the service is provided 
maintenance revenues are recognized ratably over the maintenance term 
the company does not generally provide for a right of return in its customer contracts 
deferred tax assets the company records a full valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets 
based on historical operating losses  it is difficult to determine the amount or timing of future earnings  therefore  there is currently no tax benefit recorded by the company 
accounting for equity instruments the company accounts for stock based awards issued to employees under the intrinsic value method in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no
