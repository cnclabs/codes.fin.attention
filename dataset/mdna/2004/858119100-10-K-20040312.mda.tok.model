item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve numerous risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements as a result of these risks and uncertainties  including those set forth in this report under forward looking statements and under risk factors 
you should read the following discussion in conjunction with selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and notes appearing elsewhere in this filing 
business discussion we are a domestic steel manufacturing company that primarily owns and operates electric arc furnace mini mills 
our steel operations include a flat roll division  a structural and rail division and a bar products division 
our flat roll division is currently our core business and consists of a flat roll mini mill located in butler  indiana  which we built and have operated since  with an annual estimated production capacity of million tons of flat rolled steel  although we achieved record production of million tons during the last two years 
our flat roll division produces a broad range of high quality hot rolled  cold rolled and coated steel products  including a large variety of value added and high margin specialty products  such as thinner gauge rolled products and galvanized products 
we sell our flat rolled products directly to end users  intermediate steel processors and service centers located primarily in the midwestern united states 
our flat rolled products are used in numerous industry sectors  including the automotive  construction and commercial industries 
our largest customer  heidtman steel products  inc heidtman  purchased million of our flat rolled products  or of our consolidated net sales  during sales from our flat roll division accounted for of our consolidated net sales during during  our flat roll division constructed a new coil coating facility at our butler mini mill at a cost of approximately million 
we commenced coating operations during the later part of the fourth quarter and produced  tons 
this facility has an annual estimated production capacity of  tons of coated flat rolled products 
we are currently operating at approximately of capacity 
as another addition to our flat roll division  on march   we purchased the galvanizing assets of galvpro ii  llc for million  plus a potential of an additional million  based on an earn out formula 
this steel coating facility is located in jeffersonville  indiana  and has an estimated annual production capacity of between  and  tons of light gauge  hot dipped  cold rolled galvanized steel 
we restarted operations at jeffersonville mid year and are currently operating at approximately of our average capacity expectations 
we supply the jeffersonville facility with steel coils from our flat roll division 
these additions to our flat roll division should enable us to further increase our mix of higher margin  value added steel product sales 
we began construction of our structural and rail division located in columbia city  indiana  in may  and commenced commercial structural steel operations during the third quarter of our structural and rail mini mill is designed to have an annual production capacity of up to million tons of structural steel beams  pilings  and other steel components  as well as standard and premium grade rails 
we are currently producing at approximately of capacity and structural steel product sales accounted for of our consolidated net sales during we expect to ship standard rail products during the first half of the initial rail shipments will be used in a testing capacity to be monitored by individual railroad companies for evaluation purposes 
this evaluation process may take up to nine months for completion 
the company generally sells its structural products directly to end users and steel service centers to be used primarily in the construction  transportation and industrial machinery markets 
on september   we purchased the special bar quality mini mill assets of qualitech steel sbq  llc  located in pittsboro  indiana for million 
we plan to invest between and million of additional capital to convert the facility to the production of merchant bars and shapes and reinforcing bar products  while retaining the ability to produce special bar quality sbq steel 
as of december   we had invested million  including capitalized interest 
the facility s anticipated annual production capacity is between  and  tons 
on december   the bar products division began commissioning and successfully produced certain sbq and merchant bar quality mbq rounds 
we expect to increase our sbq and mbq product offerings throughout the first half of and anticipate the addition of angles  flats and channels during the third quarter 
our bar products division plans to market the bar products directly to end users and to service centers for the construction  transportation and industrial machinery markets 
metallic raw materials used in our electric arc furnaces represent our single most significant manufacturing cost and historically  has generally accounted for between and of our consolidated cost of goods sold 
however  due to increasing metallic raw material costs  we believe it is likely that this percentage will be higher during the metallic raw material mix utilized in our electric arc furnaces is composed of approximately steel scrap and alternative iron units 
from the second quarter of throughout  we experienced a steady decline in metallic raw material pricing  reaching historically low levels in the fourth quarter of  however  during and through current markets  we have experienced a steady pricing increase 
metallic raw material costs are now at historical highs 
we believe this increase is partly due to a weakened us dollar  less than normal production of domestic scrap and increased demand for these metals from foreign steel manufacturers 
we believe the volatility of the metallic market necessitates the generation of a cost effective alternative iron source 
since  in an effort to reduce our exposure to the volatile metals markets  we have tried to develop and commercialize a pioneering process for the production of a virgin form of iron which might serve as a lower cost substitute for the alternative iron units utilized in our electric arc furnaces for melting into new steel 
our process involves the production and conversion of direct reduced iron into liquid pig iron at our ironmaking facility  iron dynamics 
since we began initial operations at iron dynamics in  the facility has produced and sold a minimal amount of liquid pig iron to our flat roll division 
during and  we encountered a number of difficulties associated with major pieces of equipment and operating processes  causing us to shut down the facility for redesign  re engineering and retrofitting 
in july  we indefinitely suspended operations due to a higher than expected start up and process refinement costs  b lower than expected production quantities  c exceptionally high energy costs  and d then historically low steel scrap pricing 
these factors made the cost of producing and using iron dynamics scrap substitute at our flat roll division higher than our cost of purchasing and using steel scrap or pig iron 
during the next year  we continued to evaluate our systems and processes 
during the fourth quarter of  iron dynamics successfully completed certain operating trials utilizing a modified production process 
this process may significantly reduce the eventual per unit cost of liquid pig iron production 
throughout  we invested million for capital expenditures required to implement this modified production process and iron dynamics restarted operations mid november  producing approximately  tonnes of hot briquetted iron during december 
since restart  the flat roll division has successfully used these iron briquettes as a part of its metallic raw material inputs 
we intend to restart the iron dynamics submerged arc furnace during the first quarter of  or early in the second quarter 
this final stage of the idi production process involves the liquefaction of the solid iron briquettes to produce liquid pig iron 
income statement classifications net sales 
our total net sales are a factor of net tons shipped  product mix and related pricing 
our net sales are determined by subtracting product returns  sales discounts  return allowances and claims from total sales 
we charge premium prices for certain grades of steel  dimensions of product  or certain smaller volumes  based on our cost of production 
we also charge marginally higher prices for our value added products from our cold mill 
these products include hot rolled and cold rolled galvanized products and cold rolled products 
cost of goods sold 
our cost of goods sold represents all direct and indirect costs associated with the manufacture of our products 
the principal elements of these costs are steel scrap and scrap substitutes  alloys  natural gas  argon  direct and indirect labor benefits  electricity  oxygen  electrodes  depreciation and freight 
our metallic raw materials  steel scrap and scrap substitutes  represent the most significant component of our cost of goods sold 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist of all costs associated with our sales  finance and accounting  materials and transportation  and administrative departments 
these costs include labor and benefits  professional services  financing cost amortization  property taxes  profit sharing expense and start up costs associated with new projects 
interest expense 
interest expense consists of interest associated with our senior credit facilities and other debt agreements as described in the notes to our financial statements contained elsewhere in this filing  net of required capitalized interest costs that are related to construction expenditures during the construction period of capital projects 
other income expense 
other income consists of interest income earned on our cash balances and any other non operating income activity  including insurance proceeds from litigation efforts 
other expense consists of any non operating costs  including other than temporary impairments of reported investments and settlement costs from litigation efforts 
operating results vs 
net income was million or 
per diluted shared during  compared with million or per diluted share during this decrease in our net income during was due to dramatically increased costs of our metallic raw materials steel scrap and scrap substitute 
net sales 
during  our consolidated net sales increased million  or  to million and our consolidated shipments increased  tons  or  to million tons  compared with these increases were due primarily to being the first full year of operations for our structural and rail division 
we had structural sales to external customers of million and shipments of  tons during  a million increase in sales and  ton increase in shipments from structural products accounted for of our consolidated shipments during  compared to during our average consolidated selling price decreased per ton to per ton during our flat roll division accounted for of our consolidated net sales during  and its pricing decreased approximately per ton compared to domestic flat rolled steel product pricing decreased during the first half of  compared to the last half of  due in part to the weakened economy and added domestic flat rolled production capacity 
with signs of a strengthening us economy during the second half of through the date of this filing  we began to experience increased demand and product pricing for most of our steel product offerings 
our divisions currently have full order books and we anticipate strong sales during at least the first half of cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold increased million  or  during to million compared with as a percentage of net sales  cost of goods sold represented approximately and during the years and  respectively 
we experienced a narrowing of our gross margin throughout as our average sales price per ton increased more slowly than our average metallic raw material cost per ton  which is the most significant single component of our cost of goods sold 
metallic raw materials represented and of our cost of goods sold during and  respectively 
we experienced a steady increase in metallic costs from the first quarter of through the end of and we anticipated further increases during the first half of our metallic raw material cost increased per net ton charged during  while our average consolidated sales price decreased per ton 
beginning in  we announced our intention to pass some of these increased costs associated with rising metallic prices through to our customers in the form of a scrap surcharge tied to an indexed scrap number 
we believe that this scrap surcharge  in conjunction with a general increase in our base product pricing and stronger demand  will result in an increase in our gross margin during the first quarter of selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million  or of net sales during  as compared to million  or of net sales during a portion of these expenses in both years was attributable to performance related employee incentive programs and facility start up costs 
costs associated with our performance related employee profit sharing plan decreased million during as compared to  which was a record year for pre tax income 
during  costs associated with start up activities at our bar products division  principally  were million compared to start up costs during of million  which related most significantly to our structural and rail division 
interest expense 
interest expense was million during  as compared to million during  an increase of million  or 
this increase in our net interest expense during was due to a decrease of million in interest required to be capitalized in connection with our construction projects 
our gross interest expense remained relatively flat at million during gain from debt extinguishment 
in january  we entered into an agreement with the iron dynamics lenders to extinguish the debt under the idi senior secured credit agreement at the end of march there was a provision within the agreement that if iron dynamics resumed operations by january   and generated positive cash flow as defined in the settlement agreement  we would be required to make contingent future payments in an aggregate amount not to exceed million 
during december  by agreement with the iron dynamics lenders  we paid million in cash to the idi lenders  terminating all of our obligations to make any additional future payments under the settlement agreement 
our financial statements reflect an ordinary non cash gain of million from the extinguishment of the million contingent liability 
other income expense 
other expense was  during  as compared to million during during  we recorded settlement costs of million  net of insurance proceeds  in association with the nsm related lawsuits 
income taxes 
during  our income tax provision was million  as compared to million during our effective tax rate was and for  and  respectively 
during  we realized a million valuation allowance that was created in for foreign tax credit carryforwards 
operating results vs 
net sales 
our net sales were million  with total shipments of million net tons during  as compared to net sales of million  with total shipments of million net tons during  an increase in net sales of million  or  and an increase in total shipments of  net tons  or 
the entire steel industry experienced pricing declines from the second half of throughout  reaching the low in the fourth quarter of however  during  prices of domestic flat rolled steel  which accounted for of our consolidated net sales during the year  increased dramatically to more normalized levels 
during  our average consolidated selling price per ton increased approximately  or  in comparison to cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold was million during  as compared to million during  an increase of million  or  which was due in large part to record sales and production volumes 
as a percentage of net sales  cost of goods sold represented approximately and during the years and  respectively 
we experienced a narrowing of our gross margin throughout as our average sales price per ton decreased more rapidly than our average metallic raw material cost per ton  which is the most significant single component of our cost of goods sold 
however  during  our gross margin strengthened as our average product pricing increased by a greater degree than our average metallic costs and as we realized greater operating efficiencies through increased production 
metallic raw materials represented and of our cost of goods sold during and  respectively 
we experienced a steady decline in metallic costs from the second quarter of through the first quarter of  at which time this downward trend ended 
our average metallic raw material cost per hot band ton produced was  or  higher during than during selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million during  as compared to million during  an increase of million  or 
a portion of these expenses in both years was attributable to performance related employee incentive programs  facility start up costs  and litigation costs associated with the nakornthai strip mill public company ltd  or nsm  litigation efforts 
costs associated with our performance related employee profit sharing plan increased approximately million during our record earnings year of  as compared to during the first six months of  costs associated with start up activities at our structural and rail division were million compared to start up costs during of million  of which million related to the structural and rail division and million related to iron dynamics 
litigation costs associated with the nsm litigation efforts were  and million during and  respectively 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses represented approximately and during and  respectively 
interest expense 
interest expense was million during  as compared to million during  an increase of million  or 
during  gross interest expense increased to million and capitalized interest decreased to million  as compared to the increase in our gross interest expense  despite the decrease in our total debt  was due to an increase in our average interest rate caused by the march refinancing  in which we accessed traditionally higher priced public debt markets 
the decrease in our capitalized interest resulted from the reduction of interest required to be capitalized with respect to our structural and rail division since construction was substantially complete at june  other income expense 
other expense was million during  as compared to million during  an increase of million 
on may   we settled the remaining lawsuit associated with the nsm litigation 
we recorded settlement costs of million and million  net of any insurance proceeds  in association with the nsm related lawsuits during and  respectively 
income taxes 
during  our income tax provision was million  as compared to million during our effective tax rate was and for and  respectively 
during  we recorded a million deferred tax asset valuation allowance related to foreign tax credits that may not be fully realized 
this allowance was still outstanding at december  extraordinary items 
during  we recorded an extraordinary loss of million  less a related tax benefit of million  related to the write off of deferred financing costs due to our march and december refinancing activities 
in accordance with guidance included in fasb  this loss is no longer classified as an extraordinary item in our statement of income at december  the loss is now included at the gross amount in selling  general and administrative expenses 
liquidity and capital resources our business is capital intensive and requires substantial expenditures for  among other things  the purchase and maintenance of equipment used in our steelmaking and finishing operations and to remain in compliance with environmental laws 
our short term and long term liquidity needs arise primarily from capital expenditures  working capital requirements and principal and interest payments related to our outstanding indebtedness 
we have met these liquidity requirements with cash provided by operations  equity  long term borrowings  state and local grants and capital cost reimbursements 
we believe the principal indicators of our liquidity are our cash position  excess working capital and availability of cash under our capital structure 
as of december   our cash and equivalents totaled million compared with million at december  the increase of million in cash was primarily due to financing activities undertaken in the fourth quarter of we received net proceeds of approximately million from the issuance of an additional million of our senior unsecured notes due march we used million of the net proceeds to prefund certain capital expenditures expected to occur during the first half of and we used million to prepay a portion of our senior secured term b loan credit facility 
working capital 
during  our operational working capital position  representing our cash invested in trade receivables and inventories less trade payables and accruals increased million to million  as compared to december  trade receivables increased million during to million  of which million  or  were less than days over due 
our largest customer is an affiliated company  heidtman steel  which represented of our outstanding trade receivables at december  during  our inventories increased million to million  primarily due to the million increase in our finished goods inventories from the ramp up of our structural and rail division 
we anticipate our trade receivables and inventories to further increase throughout  as our structural and rail and bar products divisions continue to ramp up their operations 
our trade payables increased million during  due to our new operations and due to the increased costs of metallic raw materials 
at december   we owed our primary metallic raw material supplier million more when compared to december  capital expenditures during  we invested million in property  plant and equipment related to our new divisions and improvement projects in our existing facilities 
we invested million  including capitalized interest  in our bar products division  million in the completion of our structural and rail division  and million for the addition of a paint line at our flat roll division 
we also purchased a satellite galvanizing facility in march  for approximately million  which includes a potential million earn out payment and we increased our ownership of new millennium from to for approximately million 
we believe these capital investments will increase our net sales and related cash flows as each project develops as previously discussed in our business discussion 
capital resources 
as of december   million under our senior secured revolving credit facility remained undrawn and available 
our ability to draw down the revolver is dependent upon our continued compliance with the financial covenants and other covenants contained in our senior secured credit agreement 
we were in compliance with these covenants at december   and expect to be in compliance during our senior secured credit agreement is secured by liens and mortgages on substantially all of our personal and real property assets  by liens and mortgages on substantially all of the personal and real property assets of our wholly owned subsidiaries  excluding new millennium building systems  and by pledges of all shares of capital stock and inter company debt held by us and each wholly owned subsidiary 
in addition  our wholly owned subsidiaries  excluding new millennium building systems  have guaranteed our obligations under the senior secured credit agreement 
the senior secured credit agreement contains financial covenants and other covenants that limit or restrict our ability to make capital expenditures  incur indebtedness  permit liens on our property  enter into transactions with affiliates  make restricted payments or investments  enter into mergers  acquisitions or consolidations  conduct asset sales  pay dividends or distributions and enter into other specified transactions and activities 
we are also required to prepay any amounts that we borrowed with the proceeds we receive from a number of specified events or transactions 
in january  we entered into an agreement with the iron dynamics lenders to extinguish the debt under the idi senior secured credit agreement at the end of march we complied with each of the settlement requirements  thus constituting full and final settlement of all of iron dynamics obligations and the steel dynamics guarantees under the iron dynamics credit agreement 
in meeting the requirements of the settlement agreement  we paid million in cash and issued an aggregate of million  or million shares  of our common stock during march in addition  there was a provision within the agreement that if iron dynamics resumed operations by january   and generated positive cash flow as defined in the settlement agreement  we would be required to make contingent future payments in an aggregate amount not to exceed million 
at december   the contingent future payments were reflected as an other long term contingent liability within our financial statements 
during december  by agreement with the iron dynamics lenders  we paid million in cash to the iron dynamics lenders  terminating all of our obligations to make any additional future payments under the settlement agreement 
our financial statements reflect a non cash gain of million from the extinguishment of the million contingent liability 
during  we received benefits from state and local governments in the form of real estate and personal property tax abatements of approximately million 
based on our current abatements and utilizing our existing long lived asset structure  we estimate the remaining annual effect on future operations to be approximately million  million  million  million  million     and  during the years through  respectively 
our ability to meet our debt service obligations and reduce our total debt will depend upon our future performance  which in turn  will depend upon general economic  financial and business conditions  along with competition  legislation and regulation  factors that are largely beyond our control 
in addition  we cannot assure you that our operating results  cash flow and capital resources will be sufficient for repayment of our indebtedness in the future 
we believe that based upon current levels of operations and anticipated growth  cash flow from operations  together with other available sources of funds including additional borrowings under our senior secured credit agreement  will be adequate for the next two years for making required payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness and for funding anticipated capital expenditures and working capital requirements 
certain of our contractual obligations will require futures cash payments as follows total after long term debt note      commodity contracts note    construction commitments note   other matters inflation we believe that inflation has not had a material effect on our results of operations 
environmental and other contingencies we have incurred  and in the future will continue to incur  capital expenditures and operating expenses for matters relating to environmental control  remediation  monitoring and compliance 
we believe  apart from our dependence on environmental construction and operating permits for our existing and proposed manufacturing facilities  that compliance with current environmental laws and regulations is not likely to have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity  however  environmental laws and regulations have changed rapidly in recent years and we may become subject to more stringent environmental laws and regulations in the future 
recent accounting pronouncements in april  the financial accounting and standards board fasb issued statement no 
fas  rescission of fasb statements no 
   amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
this statement rescinded fas  which required all gains and losses from extinguishment of debt to be aggregated and classified as an extraordinary item  net of the related income tax effect  within the statement of income 
we adopted fas in january as required 
upon adoption  any gain or loss on extinguishment of debt that was classified as an extraordinary item in prior periods that did not meet the criteria in apb for classification as an extraordinary item  was reclassified as income or loss from continuing operations 
the loss on extinguishment of debt we recorded in of million  net of related tax of million  is no longer classified as an extraordinary item in our statement of income 
the loss is now included at the gross amount in selling  general and administrative expenses 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin requires a company  at the time it issues certain guarantees  to recognize an initial liability for the fair value of the obligations assumed under the guarantee 
fin also provides guidance concerning existing disclosure requirements related to guarantees and warranties 
we adopted fin as of december   as required and the adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
revised december fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
fin r provides a new framework for identifying variable interest entities vies and determining when a company should include the assets  liabilities  non controlling interests and results of activities of a vie in its consolidated financial statements and provides guidance related to a company s initial and subsequent measurement of newly consolidated vies 
in general  a vie is a corporation  partnership  limited liability corporation  trust or any other legal structure used to conduct activities or hold assets that either has an insufficient amount of equity to carry out is principal activities without additional subordinated financial support  a group of equity owners that are unable to make significant decisions about its activities  or  a group of equity owners that do not have the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive returns generated by its operations 
fin r requires a vie to be consolidated if a party with an ownership  contractual or other financial interest in the vie is obligated to absorb a majority of the risk of loss from the vie s activities  is entitled to receive a majority of the vie s residual returns  or both 
fin r must be applied to all entities subject to this interpretation as of march  however  prior to the required application of this interpretation  fin r must be applied to those entities that are considered to be special purpose entities as of december  there was no impact to our financial statements from the application of this interpretation at december  at this time we do not believe the adoption of fin r will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued fas no 
fas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the statement amends and clarifies accounting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities under fas the amendments set forth in fas improve financial reporting by requiring that contracts with comparable characteristics be accounted for similarly 
fas is effective for contracts entered into or modified after june   except for certain outlined exceptions 
we adopted this with no initial impact to our financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued fas no 
fas  accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
fas changes the accounting for certain financial instruments that  under previous guidance  could be classified as equity or mezzanine equity  by now requiring these instruments be classified as liabilities or assets in some circumstances in the balance sheet 
further  fas requires disclosure regarding the terms of those instruments and settlement alternatives 
the guidance is generally effective for all financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and is otherwise effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  we adopted fas with no initial impact to our financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
we review the accounting policies we use in reporting our financial results on a regular basis 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate the appropriateness of these estimations and judgments on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts 
we recognize revenues from sales and the allowance for estimated costs associated with returns from these sales when the title of the product transfers upon shipment 
provision is made for estimated product returns and customer claims based on estimates and actual historical experience 
if the historical data used in our estimates does not reflect future returns and claims trends  additional provision may be necessary 
our steel joist and steel decking operation  new millennium building systems  recognizes revenues from construction contracts on a percentage of completion method based on steel consumed to date as a percentage of the estimated total steel required for each contract 
new millennium accounted for of our net sales 
we are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonpayment by our customers  which are principally within the intermediate steel processor  service center  automotive and construction industries 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments based on known credit risks  historical loss experience and current economic conditions affecting our customers 
we mitigate our exposure to credit risk by performing ongoing credit evaluations and taking further action when necessary  such as requiring letters of credit or other security interests to support the receivable from our customer 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in the impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowance may be required 
impairments of long lived assets 
in accordance with the methodology described in fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
impairment losses are recorded on long lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets carrying amounts 
the impairment loss is measured by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying amount 
during  events and circumstances indicated that million of assets related to iron dynamics might be impaired 
however  our estimate of undiscounted cash flows was approximately million in excess of such carrying amounts and  therefore  no charge has been recorded at december  we made various assumptions in estimating the undiscounted cash flows  including  among other things  a weighted average of the most likely achieved production levels  significant cost components  required capital expenditures and the ramp up of commercial production 
nonetheless  it is reasonably possible that our estimate of undiscounted cash flows may change in the near term due to  among other things  technological changes  economic conditions  and changes in the business model or changes in operating performance  resulting in the need to write down those assets to fair value 
deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we are required to estimate our income taxes as a part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements 
this requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatments of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
as of december   we had available net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and capital loss carryforwards of approximately million  which expire beginning and  respectively 
during  we were unable to utilize a million foreign tax credit carryforward  which we had created a valuation allowance of million for in therefore  the valuation allowance was realized in item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk in the normal course of business we are exposed to interest rate changes 
our objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of these rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  we primarily use interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes related to our portfolio of borrowings 
we generally maintain fixed rate debt as a percentage of our net debt between a minimum and maximum percentage 
a portion of our debt has an interest component that resets on a periodic basis to reflect current market conditions 
the following table represents the principal cash repayments and related weighted average interest rates by maturity date for our long term debt as of december  in millions interest rate risk fixed rate variable rate average average principal rate principal rate expected maturity date thereafter total fair value commodity risk in the normal course of business we are exposed to the market risk and price fluctuations related to the sale of steel products and to the purchase of commodities used in our production process  such as metallic raw materials  electricity  natural gas and alloys 
our risk strategy associated with product sales has generally been to obtain competitive prices for our products and to allow operating results to reflect market price movements dictated by supply and demand 
during  approximately of our net sales were under fixed price contracts with greater than twelve month commitments 
our risk strategy associated with the purchase of commodities utilized within our production process has generally been to make certain commitments with suppliers relating to future expected requirements for such commodities 
certain of these commitments contain provisions which require us to take or pay for specified quantities without regard to actual usage for periods of up to years 
during the years ending december   and  we have commitments for natural gas and its transportation with take or pay or other similar commitment provisions for approximately million  million and  respectively 
we fully utilized all such take or pay requirements during the past three years and purchased million  million and million  during the years ended december   and  respectively  under these contracts 
we believe that our production requirements will be such that consumption of the products or services purchased under these commitments will occur in the normal production process 
we also purchase electricity consumed at our flat roll division pursuant to a contract which extends through december the contract designates hours as interruptible service during  and these interruptible hours further decrease annually through expiration of the agreement 
the contract also establishes an agreed fixed rate energy charge per mill kwh consumed for each year through the expiration of the agreement
