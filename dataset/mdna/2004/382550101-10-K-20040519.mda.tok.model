item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the goodyear tire rubber company is one of the world s leading manufacturers of tires and rubber products with one of the most recognized brand names in the world 
we have a broad global footprint with manufacturing facilities in countries 
our business is run through seven operating segments north american tire  european union tire  eastern europe  africa and middle east tire  latin america tire  asia tire  engineered products  and chemical products 
in each of the last three years we have experienced significant net losses 
our net losses for  and were million   million as restated and including a non cash charge of billion to establish a tax valuation allowance and million as restated  respectively 
our results are highly dependent upon the results of our north american tire segment  which accounted for approximately of our consolidated net sales in in recent years  north american tire results have been negatively impacted by several factors  including over capacity which limits pricing leverage  weakness in the replacement tire market  increased competition from low cost manufacturers  a decline in market share and increases in medical and pension costs 
in  north american tire has a segment operating loss of million compared to a segment operating loss of million as restated for and segment operating income of million as restated for in our second largest segment  european union tire  we had segment operating income of million  million as restated and million as restated in  and  respectively 
approximately of the increase in segment operating income from to is attributable to the strength of the euro 
the segment operating income of our five other operating segments has remained strong and has increased each year since in addition to the disappointing results of our north american tire segment  increases in raw material and energy costs have offset many of the benefits of the numerous cost reduction actions we have taken over the past year 
in particular  in  the price of one of our most important raw materials  natural rubber  increased approximately and the cost of oil increased approximately over the same period 
we estimate that the rise in raw material costs increased our cost of goods sold by approximately million in we expect that the price of oil and natural rubber will continue to increase in increased interest expense and financing fees also negatively impacted our results in interest expense increased from million as restated in to million in primarily due to our refinancing efforts 
fees and expenses related to our refinancing efforts in totaled approximately million  of which million was charged against income in the amount charged against income in of million included the writeoff of unamortized fees associated with the facilities that were replaced 
financing activities completed in the first quarter of will further increase our interest expense 
a key indicator of our operating performance is market share  especially in our two largest regions  north america and western europe 
listed below is our estimated market share in each of these two regions for our two primary tire markets original equipment and replacement 
north western america europe estimated estimated market share market share original equipment replacement the above percentages are estimates only and are based on a combination of industry publications and surveys and internal company surveys 
in the north american replacement market  a significant increase in business in our dealer channel was not enough to offset a large loss in the lower margin private label market primarily due to aggressive competition by low cost foreign manufacturers 
the north american original equipment market remained steady even as we became more selective in the fitments we pursued with vehicle manufacturers 
in western europe  the increase in the replacement market was due to the successful 
table of contents introduction of several new products and an increased focus on sales by product 
the reduction in our share of the western european original equipment market is largely due to our strategy to be more selective in pursuing original equipment fitments 
we refinanced most of our debt on april  with facilities that are secured by a substantial portion of our assets 
while we completed additional debt refinancing in the first quarter of  we must take additional actions  including accessing the capital markets or refinancing additional debt  to ensure that we have sufficient liquidity over the long term 
for example  we have a number of obligations coming due over the next few years  including substantial required domestic pension plan obligations of approximately million in and approximately million to million in in addition  after taking into account the paydown of certain obligations in connection with our recent financing activities  we have an aggregate of  million and  million of long term debt coming due in and  respectively 
we expect to meet our obligations as they come due through available cash and cash equivalents  internally generated funds and borrowings 
while new financing may be available to us  access to such financing cannot be assured given the recent performance of our business  our current debt ratings and restrictions on our ability to pledge additional assets as security 
failure to obtain new financing could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity 
given these and other obligations  unanticipated events could significantly impact our liquidity 
for example  although we have entered into a conditional settlement agreement to resolve a substantial portion of product liability claims relating to a rubber hose product we previously manufactured  unless this settlement is finalized  we will be subject to numerous claims  the resolution of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial position and liquidity 
during the third quarter of  our management and our audit committee determined that it was appropriate to restate our previously issued financial results to record adjustments resulting from various accounting matters 
the results of an investigation into potential accounting improprieties in our overseas operations led to an additional restatement 
the impact of these restatements is described in note to our financial statements 
we are currently subject to an sec investigation into the facts and circumstances surrounding the restatement 
we cannot predict the outcome of the investigation  and any adverse developments in connection with the investigation  including the initiation of an enforcement action  could be costly and could seriously harm our business 
results of operations all per share amounts are diluted consolidated net sales in were billion  compared to billion as restated in and billion as restated in a net loss of million  per share  was recorded in a net loss of billion as restated  per share as restated  was recorded in  primarily resulting from a non cash charge of billion as restated to establish a valuation allowance against goodyear s net federal and state deferred tax assets

union agreement on september   the united steelworkers of america the uswa and goodyear announced the ratification of a new labor agreement 
the agreement covers workers at tire and engineered products plants in the united states and contains provisions governing healthcare benefits  pension service and wages 
the agreement assigns protected plant status to of the plants and permits a th plant to achieve protected status if certain productivity goals are met 
a protected plant cannot be closed during the duration of the agreement and goodyear is generally required to maintain the current level of capital expenditures at these plants 
the agreement also gives goodyear the option to reduce the hourly workforce at protected plants by compared to august staffing levels 
goodyear has also agreed to give uswa plants first consideration on all new products intended for sale in north america to the extent covered plants have the capacity and capability to manufacture the product 
goodyear retains the right to import tires from the company s plants outside of the united states to the extent the uswa plant that is manufacturing the product is operating at full capacity 
under the agreement  the uswa has the right to nominate an individual for a seat on goodyear s board of directors 
goodyear has also agreed to remain neutral should the uswa attempt to organize one of goodyear s non union facilities 
goodyear must also require a buyer of any of goodyear s plants to negotiate a labor agreement as a precondition of the sale 

table of contents goodyear also committed under the agreement to consummate the issuance or placement of at least million of debt securities and at least million of equity or equity linked securities by december  goodyear did not meet this commitment 
as a result  the uswa may file a grievance and strike 
in the event of a strike  the company s financial position  results of operations and liquidity could be materially adversely affected 
goodyear has also committed to launch  by december   a refinancing of its us term loan and revolving credit facilities due in april with loans or securities having a term of at least three years 
if goodyear fails to complete this refinancing commitment  the uswa would have the right to strike and goodyear would be required to pay each covered union employee approximately  as of december   and each covered union retiree approximately  as of december  finally  goodyear committed to remain in compliance with the interest expense coverage ratio  consolidated net worth  and senior secured indebtedness ratio covenants in its us revolving credit facility 
if goodyear fails to remain in compliance with these covenants  it has agreed to use its best efforts to seek a substantial private equity investment 
such investment would be expected to provide the investor with significant influence in the management and direction of goodyear 
critical accounting policies  accounting estimates and uncertainties general market uncertainties goodyear s results of operations  financial position and liquidity could be adversely affected in future periods by loss of market share or lower demand in the replacement market or from the original equipment industry  which would result in lower levels of plant utilization that would increase unit costs 
also  goodyear could experience higher raw material and energy prices in future periods 
these costs  if incurred  may not be recoverable due to pricing pressures present in today s highly competitive market 
goodyear is unable to predict future currency fluctuations 
sales and earnings in future periods would be unfavorably impacted if the us dollar strengthens versus various foreign currencies 
a continuation of the current economic conditions in the united states and europe is likely to unfavorably impact goodyear s sales and earnings in future periods 
similarly  continued volatile economic conditions in emerging markets could adversely affect sales and earnings in future periods 
goodyear may also be impacted by economic disruptions associated with global events including war  acts of terror and civil obstructions 
critical accounting policies  use of estimates and assumptions the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and related notes to financial statements 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
on an ongoing basis  management reviews its estimates  including those related to the allowance for doubtful accounts  recoverability of intangibles and other long lived assets  deferred tax asset valuation allowance  warranty  workers compensation  litigation  general and product liabilities  environmental liabilities  pension and postretirement benefits  and various other operating allowances and accruals  based on currently available information 
changes in facts and circumstances may alter such estimates and affect results of operations and financial position in future periods 
general and product liability and other litigation 
goodyear had recorded liabilities totaling million at december  and million as restated at december  for potential product liability and other tort claims  including related legal fees expected to be incurred 
of these amounts  million and million as restated were included in other current liabilities at december  and  respectively 
the amounts recorded were estimated on the basis of an assessment of potential liability using an analysis of available information with respect to pending claims  historical experience and  where available  recent and current trends 
the company had recorded insurance receivables for potential product liability and other tort claims of million at december  and million at december  of this amount  million and million was included in current assets as part of accounts and notes receivable at december  and december   respectively 
asbestos 
goodyear is a defendant in numerous lawsuits alleging various asbestos related personal injuries purported to result from alleged exposure to asbestos in certain rubber encapsulated products or aircraft 
table of contents braking systems manufactured by goodyear in the past or to asbestos in certain goodyear facilities 
typically  these lawsuits have been brought against multiple defendants in state and federal courts 
in connection with the preparation of its financial statements  the company engaged an independent asbestos valuation expert to assist the company in reviewing its reserves for asbestos claims  and review the company s method of determining its receivables from probable insurance recoveries 
prior to the fourth quarter of  the company s estimate for asbestos liability was based upon a review of the various characteristics of the pending claims by an experienced asbestos counsel 
the company  based on the advice of the valuation expert  has recorded liabilities for both asserted and unasserted claims at december  totaling million  inclusive of defense costs 
the recorded liability represents the company s estimated liability through  which represents the period over which the liability can be reasonably estimated 
due to the difficulties in making these estimates  analysis based on new data and or changed circumstances arising in the future could result in an increase in the recorded obligation in an amount that cannot currently be reasonably estimated  and that increase could be significant 
the portion of the liability associated with unasserted asbestos claims at december  is million 
prior to the fourth quarter of  the company did not have an accrual for unasserted claims as sufficient information was deemed to be not available to reliably estimate such an obligation 
this conclusion was further confirmed by the valuation expert during the preparation of the financial statements 
at december   the company s liability with respect to asserted claims and related defense costs was million compared to million at december   notwithstanding an increase in the number of pending claims between december  and december  the reduction in the amount recorded at december  compared to december  is due to refinements in certain assumptions used by the valuation expert 
after reviewing the company s recent settlement history by jurisdiction  law firm  disease type and alleged date of first exposure  the valuation expert cited two primary reasons for the company to refine its valuation assumptions 
first  in calculating the company s estimated liability  the valuation expert determined that the company had previously assumed that it would resolve more claims in the foreseeable future than is likely based on its historical record and nationwide trends 
as a result  the company now assumes that a smaller percentage of pending claims will be resolved within the predictable future 
second  the valuation expert determined that it was not possible to estimate a liability for as many non malignancy claims as the company had done in the past 
as a result  the company s current estimated liability includes fewer liabilities associated with non malignancy claims 
goodyear maintains primary insurance coverage under coverage in place agreements as well as excess liability insurance with respect to asbestos liabilities 
goodyear records a receivable with respect to such policies when it determines that recovery is probable and it can reasonably estimate the amount of a particular recovery 
prior to  goodyear did not record a receivable for expected recoveries from excess carriers in respect of asbestos related matters 
goodyear has instituted coverage actions against certain of these excess carriers 
after consultation with its outside legal counsel and giving consideration to relevant factors including the ongoing legal proceedings with certain of its excess coverage insurance carriers  their financial viability  their legal obligations and other pertinent facts  goodyear determined an amount it expects is probable of recovery from such carriers 
accordingly  goodyear recorded a receivable during  which represents an estimate of recovery from its excess coverage insurance carriers relating to potential asbestos related liabilities 
the valuation expert also reviewed the company s method of valuing its receivables recorded for probable insurance recoveries 
based upon the model employed by the valuation expert  as of december   the company recorded a receivable related to asbestos claims of million 
based on the company s current asbestos claim profile  the company expects that approximately of asbestos claim related losses will be recoverable up to its accessible policy limits 
the receivable recorded consists of an amount the company expects to collect under coverage in place agreements with certain primary carriers as well as an amount it believes is probable of recovery from certain of its excess coverage insurance carriers 
of this amount  million was included in current assets as part of accounts and notes receivable at 
table of contents december  goodyear had recorded insurance receivables of million at december  of this amount  million was included in current assets as part of accounts and notes receivable 
goodyear believes that its reserve for asbestos claims  and the insurance assets recorded in respect of these claims  reflect reasonable and probable estimates of these amounts  subject to the exclusion of claims for which it is not feasible to make reasonable estimates 
the estimate of the assets and liabilities related to pending and expected future asbestos claims and insurance recoveries is subject to numerous uncertainties  including  but not limited to  changes in i the litigation environment  ii federal and state law governing the compensation of asbestos claimants  iii the company s approach to defending and resolving claims  and iv the level of payments made to claimants from other sources  including other defendants 
as a result  with respect to both asserted and unasserted claims  it is reasonably possible that the company may incur a material amount in excess of the current reserve  however such amount cannot be reasonably estimated 
heatway entran ii 
the company is a defendant in class actions or potential class actions and four other civil actions in various federal  state and canadian courts asserting non asbestos property damage claims relating to entran ii  a rubber hose product that it supplied from to chiles power supply  inc d b a heatway systems  a designer and seller of hydronic radiant heating systems in the united states 
the plaintiffs in these actions are generally seeking recovery under various tort  contract and statutory causes of action  including breach of express warranty  breach of implied warranty of merchantability  breach of implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose  negligence  strict liability and violation of state consumer protection statutes 
in one of the above mentioned class actions  on october   the united states district court for district court of new jersey preliminarily approved a proposed national settlement agreement the proposed settlement for pending entran ii claims in the us and canada  except for claims related to property in six new england states  two judgments in colorado state court  two judgments in colorado federal court  and any future judgments involving claimants that opt out of the proposed settlement 
claimants had until may   to opt out of the proposed settlement 
the company has the right to withdraw from the proposed settlement if it determines in good faith and in its sole discretion that an excessive number of persons have opted out of the class and the proposed settlement 
as of may   the company had received notice that at least potential sites had been opted out of the proposed settlement 
the company is currently assessing its options with respect to the proposed settlement and expects to decide shortly whether or not to withdraw from the proposed settlement 
the ultimate cost of disposing of entran ii claims is dependent upon a number of factors  including the company s ability to satisfy the contingencies in any settlement  the number of claimants that opt out of any settlement  final approval of the terms of any settlement 
goodyear s ability to resolve claims not subject to any settlement including the cases in which the company received adverse judgments  and  in the event goodyear fails to consummate a settlement for any reason  future judgments by courts in other currently pending or yet unasserted actions 
depending on the resolution of these uncertainties  the costs associated with entran ii claims could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  financial position and liquidity in future periods 
due to the uncertainties inherent in entran ii matters  it is reasonably possible that there exists material liability beyond what goodyear has already reserved for  but such amounts cannot be reasonably estimated 
other actions 
the company is currently a party to various claims and legal proceedings in addition to those noted above 
if management believes that a loss arising from these matters is probable and can reasonably be estimated  the company records the amount of the loss  or the minimum estimated liability when the loss is estimated using a range  and no point within the range is more probable than another 
as additional information becomes available  any potential liability related to these matters is assessed and the estimates are revised  if necessary 
based on currently available information  management believes that the ultimate outcome of these matters  individually and in the aggregate  will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position or overall trends in results of operations 
however  litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties  and unfavorable rulings could occur 
an unfavorable ruling could include monetary damages or an injunction prohibiting the company from selling one or more products 
if an unfavorable ruling were to occur  there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on the financial position and results of operations of the period in which the ruling occurs  or future periods 

table of contents environmental matters 
goodyear had recorded liabilities totaling million at december  and million at december  for anticipated costs related to various environmental matters  primarily the remediation of numerous waste disposal sites and certain properties sold by goodyear 
of these amounts  million and million were included in other current liabilities at december  and december   respectively 
the costs include legal and consulting fees  site studies  the design and implementation of remediation plans  post remediation monitoring and related activities and will be paid over several years 
the amount of goodyear s ultimate liability in respect of these matters may be affected by several uncertainties  primarily the ultimate cost of required remediation and the extent to which other responsible parties contribute 
the liability was reduced in by approximately million due to the resolution related to one site during the year 
workers compensation 
goodyear had recorded liabilities  on a discounted basis  totaling million and million as restated for anticipated costs related to workers compensation at december  and december   respectively 
of these amounts  million and million as restated were included in current liabilities as part of compensation and benefits at december  and december   respectively 
the costs include an estimate of expected settlements on pending claims  defense costs and a provision for claims incurred but not reported 
these estimates are based on goodyear s assessment of potential liability using an analysis of available information with respect to pending claims  historical experience  and current cost trends 
the amount of goodyear s ultimate liability in respect of these matters may differ from these estimates 
goodwill 
in january  goodyear adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
under this standard  goodyear no longer amortizes goodwill  but tests it annually for impairment because it is an asset with an indefinite useful life 
however  the occurrence of a potential indicator of impairment  such as a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climate  an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  unanticipated competition  loss of key personnel or a more likely than not expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit will be sold or disposed of  would result in goodyear s having to perform the impairment analysis more frequently than on an annual basis 
these types of events and the resulting analysis could result in goodwill impairment charges in future periods 
the company determined estimated fair values of the reporting units using a valuation methodology based largely on comparable company analysis 
under this method  the company used an ebitda multiple representative of the global automotive industry sector to arrive at the fair value of each reporting unit

deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
at december   goodyear had valuation allowances aggregating billion against all of its net federal and state and some of its international subsidiaries deferred tax assets 
the net federal and state deferred tax assets are almost entirely composed of deductions available to reduce federal and state taxable income in future years 
the international deferred tax assets include loss carryforwards as well as deductions available to reduce future international taxable income 
the valuation allowance was calculated in accordance with the provisions of sfas which requires an assessment of both negative and positive evidence when measuring the need for a valuation allowance 
in accordance with sfas  evidence  such as operating results during the most recent three year period  is given more weight than our expectations of future profitability which are inherently uncertain 
goodyear s us losses in recent periods represented sufficient negative evidence to require a full valuation allowance against its net federal and state deferred tax assets under sfas goodyear intends to maintain a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets until sufficient positive evidence exists to support realization of the federal and state deferred tax assets 
pensions and postretirement benefits 
goodyear s recorded liability for pensions and postretirement benefits other than pensions is based on a number of assumptions  including future health care costs  maximum 
table of contents company covered benefit costs  life expectancies  retirement rates  discount rates  long term rates of return on plan assets and future compensation levels 
certain of these assumptions are determined with the assistance of outside actuaries 
assumptions about health care costs  life expectancies  retirement rates and future compensation levels are based on past experience and anticipated future trends  including an assumption about inflation 
discount rates are based on market indicators at the time these assumptions are established 
these assumptions are regularly reviewed and revised when appropriate  and changes in one or more of them could affect the amount of goodyear s recorded expenses for these benefits 
if the actual experience differs from expectations  goodyear s financial position  results of operations and liquidity in future periods could be affected 
as of december   the aggregate projected benefit obligation for goodyear s pension plans was billion 
a basis point change in the us discount rate would impact pension expense in by approximately million 
as of december   goodyear s accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was billion 
a basis point change in the discount rate for its main us plans would impact postretirement benefit expense by approximately million 
goodyear s us pension asset returns were for the year ended december  the unfunded amount of goodyear s projected benefit obligation at december  was billion  compared to billion as restated at december  for the year ended december   goodyear recorded a million benefit to accumulated other comprehensive income loss for unfunded pension benefit obligations  compared to a billion charge for the year ended december  if market conditions deteriorate  charges could increase in future periods 
although subject to change  based on current estimates  goodyear expects to make contributions to its domestic pension plans of approximately million in  and approximately million to million in to satisfy statutory minimum funding requirements 
goodyear will be subject to additional statutory minimum funding requirements after the amount of funding requirements could be substantial and will be based on a number of factors  including the value of the pension assets at the time as well as the interest rate for the relevant period

moody s currently maintains a negative outlook for the company  while s p has placed us on credit watch 
unless the company s debt credit ratings and operating performance improve  its access to the credit markets in the future may be limited 
moreover  a further reduction in the company s credit ratings would further increase the cost of any financing initiatives the company may pursue 
as a result of these ratings and other related events  the company believes that its access to capital markets may be limited 
in addition  financing and related expenses under some existing arrangements have increased as a result of the company s non investment grade ratings 
a rating reflects only the view of a rating agency  and is not a recommendation to buy  sell or hold securities 
any rating can be revised upward or downward at any time by a rating agency if such rating agency decides that circumstances warrant such a change 
turnaround strategy the company is currently implementing a turnaround strategy for the north american tire segment that will require the company to stabilize margins and market shares  simplify the sales and supply chain process  execute key cost cutting  brand and distribution strategies and grow the business through new product introductions and new sales channels 
the ability of the company to successfully implement its cost cutting strategy is also dependent upon its ability to realize anticipated savings and operational benefits from its recently ratified new master contract with the uswa 
there is no assurance that the company will successfully implement this turnaround strategy 
in particular  this strategy and the company s liquidity could be affected adversely by trends that affected the north american tire segment negatively in and prior years  including industry overcapacity which limits pricing leverage  weakness in the replacement tire market  increased competition from low cost manufacturers and a related decline in goodyear s market share  weak us economic conditions  and increases in medical and pension costs 
in addition  the turnaround strategy has been  and may continue to be  impacted negatively by higher than expected raw materials and energy prices 
the price of natural rubber  one of our most important raw materials  increased approximately in and is expected to increase in in addition  the price of oil  an important feedstock for several other raw materials  increased approximately in our turnaround plan could continue to be impacted by higher raw material costs 
furthermore  market conditions may prevent us from passing these increases on to our customers through timely price increases 
future liquidity requirements as of december   the company had billion in cash and cash equivalents  of which million was held in the united states and million was in accounts of gdte 
the remaining amounts were held in the company s other non us operations 
the company s ability to move cash and cash equivalents among its various operating locations is subject to the operating needs of the operating 
table of contents locations as well as restrictions imposed by local laws and applicable credit facility agreements 
as of december   approximately million of cash was held in locations where significant tax or legal impediments would make it difficult or costly to execute monetary transfers 
based upon the company s projected operating results  the company expects that cash flow from operations together with available borrowing under its restructured credit facilities and other sources of liquidity will be adequate to meet the company s anticipated cash and cash equivalent requirements including working capital  debt service and capital expenditures through december  at december   the company also had million of unused availability under its various credit agreements 
the company s restructured and refinanced credit facilities mature in and and the company would have to refinance these facilities in the capital markets if they were not renewed by the banks 
after taking into account the paydown of certain obligations in connection with recent financing activities  the aggregate amount of long term debt maturing in and is  million and  million  respectively 
because of our debt ratings  recent operating performance and other factors  access to such markets cannot be assured 
the company s ongoing ability to access the capital markets is highly dependent on successfully implementing its north american tire turnaround strategy 
in addition to facilitating access to the capital markets  successful implementation of the turnaround strategy is also crucial to ensuring that the company has sufficient cash flow from operations to meet its obligations 
there is no assurance that the company will be successful in implementing its turnaround strategy 
failure to complete the turnaround strategy successfully could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
although the company is highly leveraged  it may become necessary for it to incur additional debt to ensure that it has adequate liquidity 
this additional debt would need to be secured or unsecured 
a substantial portion of the company s assets are already subject to liens securing its indebtedness 
the company is limited in its ability to pledge its remaining assets as security for additional secured indebtedness 
in addition  unless the company s financial performance improves  its ability to raise unsecured debt may be significantly limited 
under the company s master contract with the uswa  the company committed to consummate the issuance or placement of at least million of debt securities and at least million of equity or equity linked securities by december  it did not meet this commitment 
as a result  the uswa may file a grievance and strike 
in the event of a strike  the company s financial position  results of operations and liquidity could be materially adversely affected 
the company has also committed to launch  by december   a refinancing of its us term loan and revolving credit facilities due in april  with loans or securities having a term of at least three years 
if the company fails to complete this refinancing commitment  the uswa would have the right to strike and the company would be required to pay each covered union employee approximately  as of december   and each covered union retiree approximately  as of december  in addition  if the company failed to comply with the covenants in its credit agreements  the lenders would have the right to cease further loans to the company and demand the repayment of all outstanding loans under these facilities 
the company is subject to various legal proceedings  including the entran ii litigation described in note  commitments and contingent liabilities 
the ultimate cost of disposing of entran ii claims is dependent upon a number of factors  including the company s ability to satisfy the contingencies in a proposed settlement  the number of claimants that opt out of any settlement  final approval of the terms of the settlement at a fairness hearing  goodyear s ability to resolve claims not subject to the settlement including the cases in which the company received adverse judgments  and  in the event goodyear fails to consummate the proposed settlement for any reason  future judgments by courts in other currently pending or yet unasserted actions 
depending on the resolution of these uncertainties  the costs associated with entran ii claims could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  financial position and liquidity in future periods 
in the event the company wishes to appeal any future adverse judgment in any entran ii or other proceeding  it would be required to post an appeal bond with the relevant 
table of contents court 
if the company does not have sufficient availability under its us revolving credit facility to issue a letter of credit to support an appeal bond  it may be required to pay down borrowings under the facility in order to increase the amount available for issuing letters of credit or deposit cash collateral in order to stay the enforcement of the judgment pending an appeal 
a significant deposit of cash collateral may have a material adverse effect on the company s liquidity 
a substantial portion of goodyear s borrowings are at variable rates of interest and expose the company to interest rate risk 
if interest rates rise  the company s debt service obligations would increase 
an unanticipated significant rise in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on the company s liquidity in future periods 
in addition  goodyear expects to make contributions to its pension plans of approximately million in contributions to domestic pension plans are expected to be approximately million in and approximately million to million in in order to satisfy statutory minimum funding requirements 
dividends on february   the company announced that it eliminated its quarterly cash dividend 
the dividend reduction was decided on by the board of directors in order to conserve cash 
under our restructured credit agreements  we are not permitted to pay dividends on our common stock 
commitments contingencies the following table presents  at december   goodyear s obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts and contingent commitments 
payment due by period as of december  in millions after contractual obligations total year years years years years years long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases binding commitments total contractual cash obligations long term debt payments include notes payable and reflect long term debt maturities as of december  in connection with the company s financing activities in the first quarter of  our long term debt commitments in and were reduced by million and million  respectively 
the present value of capital lease obligations is million 
operating leases do not include minimum sublease rentals of million  million  million  million  million  and million in each of the periods above  respectively  for a total of million 
net operating lease payments total  million 
the present value of operating leases is million 
the operating leases relate to  among other things  computers and office equipment  real estate and miscellaneous other assets 
no asset is leased from any related party 
binding commitments are for normal operations of the company and include investments in land  buildings and equipment and raw materials purchased through short term supply contracts at fixed prices or at formula prices related to market prices or negotiated prices 
in addition to the commitments summarized above  goodyear is required to make contributions to its defined benefit pension plans 
these contributions are required under the minimum funding requirements of the employee retirement pension plan income security act erisa 
subject to change  goodyear expects to make contributions to its domestic pension plans of approximately million in and approximately million to million in in order to satisfy these statutory minimum funding requirements 
these estimates reflect legislation passed by congress in providing for changes to erisa 
table of contents funding requirements to defer certain contributions to subsequent periods 
due to uncertainties regarding significant assumptions involved in estimating future required contributions to its defined benefit pension plans  such as interest rate levels and the amount and timing of asset returns  goodyear is not able to reasonably estimate its future required contributions beyond in addition  the following contingent contractual obligations  the amounts of which can not be estimated  are not included in the table above the terms and conditions of goodyear s global alliance with sumitomo as set forth in the umbrella agreement between goodyear and sumitomo provide for certain minority exit rights available to sumitomo commencing in in addition  the occurrence of certain other events enumerated in the umbrella agreement  including certain bankruptcy events or changes in control of goodyear  could trigger a right of sumitomo to require goodyear to purchase these interests immediately 
sumitomo s exit rights  in the unlikely event of exercise  could require goodyear to make a substantial payment to acquire sumitomo s interest in the alliance 
pursuant to an agreement entered into in  ansell ltd 
ansell has the right  during the period beginning august and ending one year later  to require goodyear to purchase ansell s interest in spt at a formula price based on the earnings of spt 
if ansell does not exercise its right  goodyear may require ansell to sell its interest to goodyear during the days following the expiration of ansell s right at a price established using the same formula 
pursuant to an agreement entered into in  goodyear shall purchase minimum amounts of carbon black from a certain supplier from january  through december   at agreed upon base prices that are subject to quarterly adjustments for changes in raw material costs and natural gas costs and a one time adjustment for other manufacturing costs 
the company does not engage in the trading of commodity contracts or any related derivative contracts 
the company generally purchases raw materials and energy through short term  intermediate and long term supply contracts at fixed prices or at formula prices related to market prices or negotiated prices 
the company will  however  from time to time  enter into contracts to hedge its energy costs 
off balance sheet arrangements an off balance sheet arrangement is any transaction  agreement or other contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has made guarantees  a retained or a contingent interest in transferred assets  an obligation under certain derivative instruments or any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing  liquidity  market risk or credit risk support to the company  or that engages in leasing  hedging or research and development arrangements with the company 
amount of commitment expiration per period after total year years years years years years in millions off balance sheet arrangements off balance sheet arrangements include  at december   approximately million related to an option held by goodyear s minority partner in sava tires to require goodyear to purchase the partner s equity interest in sava tires 
goodyear has a similar call option on the remaining interest 
the minority partner could exercise its option and goodyear could exercise its call option during various periods beginning in and extending through on april   goodyear announced that it would exercise its call option and purchase the remaining of sava tires 
the transaction is expected to be completed in june and goodyear expects to pay approximately million at that time 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk goodyear continuously monitors its fixed and floating rate debt mix 
within defined limitations  goodyear manages the mix using refinancing and unleveraged interest rate swaps 
goodyear will enter into fixed and floating interest rate swaps to alter its exposure to the impact of changing interest rates on consolidated results of operations and future cash outflows for interest 
fixed rate swaps are used to reduce goodyear s risk of increased interest costs during periods of rising interest rates  and are normally designated as cash flow hedges 
floating rate swaps are used to convert the fixed rates of long term borrowings into short term variable rates  and are normally designated as fair value hedges 
interest rate swap contracts are thus used by goodyear to separate interest rate risk management from debt funding decisions 
at december   the interest rates on of goodyear s debt were fixed by either the nature of the obligation or through the interest rate swap contracts  compared to at december  the decrease in the percent of fixed rate debt was primarily due to the maturity of the notes during goodyear also has from time to time entered into interest rate lock contracts to hedge the risk free component of anticipated debt issuances 
as a result of credit ratings actions and other related events  the company s access to these instruments may be limited

the sensitivity to changes in interest rates of goodyear s interest rate contracts and fixed rate debt was determined with a valuation model based upon net modified duration analysis 
the model assumes a parallel shift in the yield curve 
the precision of the model decreases as the assumed change in interest rates increases 
foreign currency exchange risk in order to reduce the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on consolidated results of operations and future foreign currency denominated cash flows  goodyear enters into foreign currency contracts 
these contracts reduce exposure to currency movements affecting existing foreign currency denominated assets  liabilities  firm commitments and forecasted transactions resulting primarily from trade receivables and payables  equipment acquisitions  intercompany loans and royalty agreements and forecasted purchases and sales 
in addition  the principal and interest on goodyear s swiss franc bond due and euro million of the euro notes due are hedged by currency swap agreements 
contracts hedging the swiss franc bond and the euro notes are designated as cash flow hedges 
contracts hedging short term trade receivables and payables normally have no hedging designation

at december   goodyear held foreign currency euro put options  exercisable during  to reduce exposure to currency movements on forecasted intercompany sales 
these options were designated as cash flow hedges 
at december   the underlying contract value of these options totaled million  and the fair value totaled million 
at december   the company did not hold any outstanding foreign currency options 
the sensitivity to changes in exchange rates of goodyear s foreign currency positions was determined using current market pricing models
