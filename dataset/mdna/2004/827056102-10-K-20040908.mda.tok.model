overview we are a leading provider of products and services for high performance computing  storage and visualization 
we sell highly scalable servers  advanced visualization systems  desktop workstations  storage solutions and a range of software products that enable our customers in the scientific  technical and creative communities to solve their most challenging problems and provide them with strategic and competitive advantage in their markets 
we also offer a range of services and solutions  including professional services  reality center immersive visualization centers  customer support and education 
these products and services are targeted primarily towards five market segments defense and security  science and research  manufacturing  energy  and media 
we have incurred net losses and negative cash flows from operations for the past several years 
the following overview describes key elements of our business strategy and our results achieved during fiscal repositioning sgi as a leader in supplying high performance systems based on the intel itanium processor and linux operating system  while managing a long term decline in sales of our traditional mips processor and irix operating system based products 
fiscal saw an important milestone for the first time sales of our intel linux based altix server family exceeded those of the mips irix based origin family 
we expect this platform shift to continue in fiscal and to accelerate as we introduce our first graphics systems built on an intel linux foundation later this year 
this change in our approach to designing systems has not altered our market or customer focus  and we continue to focus on research and development investments  at rates above the industry average  with the goal of delivering value added products 
because our goal is clear differentiation and not just compatibility  we are required to work closely with intel and with the open source community to ensure that our products take full advantage of their underlying technologies and that those technologies evolve in ways that support our strengths 
we also must make highly targeted investments in the technologies that will provide our performance differentiation 
reducing our expenses to levels commensurate with our current revenues 
we have reduced our total costs and expenses from billion in fiscal to billion in fiscal and further to million in fiscal  as a result of restructuring actions which included headcount reductions and facility closures 
these actions  as well as improved business processes  have also enabled us to retain relatively high gross margins for our industry for the year ended june  generating cash from non core assets and businesses 
we have focused our investments on the core elements of our business and have sought to generate cash from the sale of non core businesses  fixed assets and non core intellectual property 
as part of this strategy  we sold our alias application software business in june  yielding approximately million in net cash proceeds after selling costs and also sold our manufacturing facility in cortaillod  switzerland in october for proceeds of million 
strengthening our balance sheet and liquidity 
during the second quarter of fiscal we completed an exchange offer under which we issued million principal amount in senior secured notes due in in exchange for notes that would otherwise have matured in september during the third quarter of fiscal we completed a private placement of common stock yielding net proceeds of million 
in addition  million principal amount of our senior secured convertible notes were converted  resulting in the issuance of approximately million shares of common stock 
at june  we had cash and equivalents and unrestricted marketable investments of million compared with million at june  results of operations the financial information and the discussion below should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
the following tables and discussion present certain financial information on a comparative basis 
our alias application software business was sold in june see note and its operating results are excluded from continuing operations and are reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented in this form k 
years ended numbers or percentages may not add due to rounding june  june  june  in millions  except per share amounts total revenue  cost of revenue gross profit gross profit margin total operating expenses operating loss interest and other expense income  net loss from continuing operations before income taxes net loss from continuing operations net income from discontinued operations net loss net loss per share from continuing operations basic and diluted net income per share from discontinued operations basic and diluted net loss per share from continuing operations basic and diluted revenue the following discussion of revenue is based on the results of our reportable segments as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
total revenue is principally derived from three reportable segments high performance systems  workstations and global services  which were determined based on factors including customer base  homogeneity of products  technology  delivery channels and other factors 
effective for fiscal  we removed our prior generations of workstations  graphics systems and high performance servers sold through our remarketed products group from the high performance systems and workstations segments after reassessment of items such as economic characteristics  homogeneity of products  technology and other factors 
revenue from our remarketed products group is now included in other revenue 
prior year amounts have been restated to conform to current year presentation 
total revenue in fiscal decreased million or compared with fiscal  and fiscal revenue decreased million or compared with fiscal the overall decline in revenue from fiscal to fiscal was largely due to decreases in workstations and services revenue due to factors discussed below  despite year over year growth in sales of our altix family of high performance servers and integrated storage solutions 
the decline in revenue from fiscal to fiscal reflected  among other factors noted below that affected particular product families  a global economic slowdown  a significant downturn in it spending  strong competition from much larger companies  the suitability of low cost cluster solutions for certain application segments and the impact of changing sgi japan s status to a distribution model 
revenue for fiscal included a one time receipt of million from microsoft resulting from an agreement involving a patent cross license and the sale of certain of sgi s intellectual property rights 
we expect certain of the factors mentioned above to continue to have an adverse impact on our future revenue levels

the following table presents total revenue by reportable segment years ended june  june  june  in millions high performance systems of total revenue workstations of total revenue global services of total revenue other of total revenue fiscal high performance systems revenue which includes visualization systems  high performance servers and integrated storage solutions increased by million or compared with fiscal primarily due to increased sales of high performance servers and integrated storage solutions  offset in part by a decline in sales of our visualization systems 
fiscal saw considerable growth in the altix family of high performance servers  offset in part by a decline in the origin family of high performance servers 
for fiscal  sales of our altix servers surpassed sales of our origin servers  with the cross over point having occurred late in fiscal the major driver of the revenue increase was significant unit growth  particularly for the lower end configurations of altix servers offset in part by a decline in their average selling prices 
to a lesser extent  increased average selling prices for the higher end altix configurations also contributed to high performance systems revenue growth 
although average selling prices for both our low and high end origin servers remained relatively stable during the year  a decline in overall volume coupled with a mix shift to the lower end configurations resulted in a decline in overall origin server revenue 
integrated storage solutions revenue for fiscal compared with fiscal increased primarily due to sustained volume growth and average selling prices that remained relatively stable year over year  despite a recent shift in mix to lower end storage solutions with lower average selling prices 
increases in overall high performance systems revenue were offset in part by a decline in our visualization systems revenue 
despite increased unit sales in fiscal compared with fiscal  a shift in mix from the higher end visualization systems with a higher average selling price to the lower end visualization systems with a lower average selling price contributed to the decline in visualization system revenue 
in fiscal  we plan to introduce our first graphics system built on an intel linux platform 
fiscal high performance systems revenue decreased million or compared with fiscal the decline was primarily noted within the high performance mips based server family and to a lesser extent within the visualization systems product family 
these declines reflected delays in the acquisition of technology by private sector businesses concerned about the economy  our corporate viability and competitive factors including processor speeds  the suitability of low cost cluster solutions for certain application segments  improvements in commodity graphics performance  and lower average selling prices 
see risks that affect our business 
fiscal workstations revenue decreased million or compared with fiscal the decrease was primarily attributable to the continuing long term decline in the overall unix workstation market  an industry wide trend that we expect will continue in fiscal as lower cost personal computers continue to gain market share 
revenue from this segment has declined steadily over the past few years as we discontinued several product families based upon both the mips and pentium iii microprocessors and as our medical oem business diminished 
reduced volumes of our octane family of visual workstations  as we completed its end of life  and both reduced volumes and lower average selling prices of the fuel visual workstation were the primary contributors to the workstations revenue decline in fiscal compared with fiscal these declines were partially offset by increased volumes and higher average selling prices associated with the tezro visual workstation which was introduced in the first quarter of fiscal fiscal workstations revenue decreased million or compared with fiscal this decline was attributable to the declining marketplace for unix workstations  particularly the end of life of our o family of workstations 
global services revenue is comprised of hardware and software support  maintenance and professional services 
fiscal global services revenue decreased million or compared with fiscal this decline was primarily attributable to a reduction in our traditional customer support revenue that is being affected by lower selling prices for new contracts compared with existing contracts  coupled with a decline in the overall installed base resulting from lower system sales in recent periods 
professional services revenue  which includes third party product and sgi consulting services  decreased slightly in fiscal compared with fiscal principally due to a decline in third party product revenue 
fiscal global services revenue decreased million or compared with fiscal this decline was primarily attributable to a reduction in our traditional customer support revenue caused by lower selling prices for new contracts and a decline in the overall installed base reflecting lower system sales volumes 
other revenue is generally comprised of our operating units that are not reportable segments  primarily revenue associated with prior generations and remarketed versions of workstations  graphics systems and high performance servers available through our remarketed products group 
fiscal other revenue decreased million or compared with fiscal due largely to a reduction in revenue from our re marketed visualization systems and origin high performance servers 
fiscal other revenue decreased million or compared with fiscal this decline was principally due to the absence of a transaction similar to the fiscal receipt of million from microsoft resulting from an intellectual property agreement involving a patent cross license and the sale of certain of sgi s intellectual property rights coupled with a reduction in revenue from our re marketed visualization systems and origin high performance servers 
total revenue by geographic area for fiscal  and was as follows in millions years ended june  june  june  area americas europe rest of world total revenue  geographic revenue as a percentage of total revenue for fiscal   and was as follows years ended june  june  june  area americas europe rest of world geographic revenue as a percentage of total revenue in fiscal remained relatively unchanged compared with fiscal the fluctuation in geographic revenue as a percentage of total revenue between europe and rest of world business in fiscal compared with fiscal was primarily due to a decline in revenue generated in japan caused by an overall economic decline in the japanese economy and the impact of no longer consolidating the financial results of sgi japan  as a result of our sale of a majority interest in that company 
our consolidated backlog at june  was million  down from million at june  backlog is comprised of committed purchase orders for products and professional services deliverable within three to nine months  depending on the product family 
backlog declines were noted in both europe and rest of world 
from a segment standpoint  backlog declined primarily within high performance systems  specifically the origin product line offset in part by an increase in altix backlog and to a lesser degree within integrated storage solutions and workstations

gross profit margin cost of product and other revenue includes costs related to product shipments  including materials  labor  overhead and other direct or allocated costs involved in their manufacture or delivery 
costs associated with non recurring engineering revenue are included in cost of sales  unless the non recurring engineering effort meets the criteria for government funded research  as outlined in financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
accounting for research and development costs 
if the contract meets the criteria for a government funded research arrangement  the costs to deliver the contract are included in research and development expense 
cost of service revenue includes all costs incurred in the support and maintenance of our products  as well as costs to deliver professional services including the costs associated with third party products 
overall gross profit margin increased to in fiscal from in fiscal fiscal product and other gross profit margin increased by percentage points compared with fiscal  of which percentage points represents savings from improved manufacturing efficiencies and procurement cost controls 
the remaining improvements in product and other gross profit margin are principally due to both stable average selling prices coupled with volume growth for our integrated storage solutions as well as an increase in workstation average selling prices resulting from a shift in mix to higher margin configurations despite reduced volumes 
these improvements were offset in part by a continuing shift in mix from the traditionally higher margin origin servers to the lower margin altix servers 
fiscal service gross profit margin improved percentage points compared with fiscal despite declining revenue levels  primarily due to overall cost control measures 
overall gross profit margin decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal fiscal product and other gross profit margin decreased by percentage points compared with fiscal included in fiscal results was million in revenue recognized from the microsoft intellectual property agreement recorded at margin which accounted for percentage points of the change in product and other gross margin from fiscal to fiscal the remainder of the decrease for fiscal was due to an unfavorable mix shift from servers with high end configurations to less profitable low end configurations  along with the introduction of altix in fiscal which carries lower margins than the mips based high performance servers 
additionally  pricing pressure increased in some very price sensitive markets such as manufacturing due to declining competitiveness in single processor performance 
fiscal service gross profit margin improved percentage points compared with fiscal despite declining revenue levels  primarily due to overall cost control measures 
operating expenses years ended june  june  june  in millions research and development of total revenue selling  general and administrative of total revenue other of total revenue total fiscal operating expenses decreased million or compared with fiscal fiscal operating expenses included million of charges for restructuring and asset impairment costs  about million of which related to relocation of our headquarters to the new crittenden technology center campus 
total fiscal operating expenses decreased million or compared with fiscal fiscal operating expenses included million of charges for restructuring and asset impairment costs 
the significant decline in operating expenses in both years was primarily due to lower headcount as a result of restructuring activities and attrition and the impact of our overall expense control measures aimed at bringing expenses more in line with revenue levels 
research and development fiscal research and development spending decreased million or compared with fiscal the fiscal decrease reflects a decline in headcount and an overall reduction in research and development activities as a result of continued restructuring actions in order to align expenses with lower revenue levels 
research and development spending decreased million or in fiscal compared with fiscal the fiscal decrease reflected similar factors 
we will continue to focus our research and development investments towards potential growth areas  including investments in our altix family of servers and the new family of intel linux visualization products we expect to introduce in fiscal  while leveraging the research and development efforts of our industry partners as we continue to move to product lines that incorporate industry standard technologies 
selling  general and administrative fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million or compared with fiscal this decrease in operating expenses resulted primarily from a decline in headcount as a result of restructuring and personnel attrition  and the impact of our overall expense control measures aimed at bringing operating expenses more in line with revenues 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million or in fiscal compared with fiscal the fiscal decrease reflected reduced headcount as a result of restructuring activities and attrition  significantly reduced commission and outside service expenses and the impact of our overall expense control measures aimed at bringing operating expenses more in line with revenues 
other operating expense over the past several years  we have initiated a number of restructuring actions under various plans aimed at bringing our expenses more in line with prevailing revenue levels and restoring long term profitability to sgi 
see note  other operating expense  for further information regarding these activities 
these actions have resulted in both headcount reductions and facility closures 
other operating expense for fiscal represented a charge for estimated restructuring of million and charges of million related to the impairment of assets  partially offset by million of adjustments to previously recorded restructuring charges 
other operating expense for fiscal represented a charge for estimated restructuring of million and charges of million associated with the impairment of assets  partially offset by million of adjustments to previously recorded restructuring charges 
other operating expense for fiscal represented a charge for estimated restructuring of million and charges of million associated with the impairment of assets  partially offset by adjustments to previously recorded restructuring charges of million 
as a result of these restructuring actions  we anticipate cash outflows of million through fiscal for severance and related charges and million through fiscal for facilities related expenditures  net of estimated sublease income of million 
due to these actions  we have reduced our total costs and expenses from billion in fiscal to billion in fiscal and further to million in fiscal the relocation of our mountain view  california headquarters  which we completed in fiscal  is expected to result in a net reduction in our facilities occupancy costs of approximately million to million per year beginning in fiscal and is expected to result in approximately million in cash savings through fiscal interest and other years ended june  june  june  in thousands interest expense    foreign exchange gain loss miscellaneous income expense    investment gain loss   interest income    loss on early extinguishment of debt  total interest income and other  net   interest expense interest expense decreased in fiscal primarily due to a million credit to interest expense related to premium amortization on our senior secured convertible notes see note  offset in part by million in interest expense associated with the induced conversion of a portion of these same convertible notes 
over the term of the senior secured convertible notes due june   we expect to record a credit to interest expense of approximately million per quarter related to premium amortization assuming no notes are converted to stock 
if these notes are converted to stock  then the credit will be larger in any given period with lower premium amortization in future periods 
interest expense increased in fiscal compared with fiscal primarily due to the full year impact of higher interest rates on our yen based loan  which was restructured in mid fiscal see note 
interest income and other  net interest income and other  net includes interest income on our cash investments  gains and losses on other investments  and other non operating items 
interest income and other  net for fiscal  excluding the loss on the early extinguishment of debt  primarily included million of income in settlement for terminating a contractual arrangement 
interest income and other  net for fiscal included the receipt of million in minority interest income related to our interest in sgi japan  a million impairment charge against an investment held at cost and a million overall loss on the sale of certain parcels of land that occurred throughout the fiscal year 
interest income and other  net for fiscal included a million gain from the sale of of our interest in sgi japan recognized in the second quarter of fiscal  a charge of million for the settlement of a securities class action lawsuit involving a payment of million in cash and the issuance of million shares of common stock and a million loss on the sale of a building recognized in the first quarter of fiscal loss on extinguishment of tendered debt during the second quarter of fiscal  we successfully completed an exchange offer for of our senior convertible notes due to mature in september the exchange offer was accounted for as a debt extinguishment and resulted in a non cash loss of approximately million  primarily representing the difference between the fair value of the new debt instruments and the net carrying value of the extinguished debt 
the difference is treated as a premium on the new senior secured convertible notes and is being amortized as an offset to interest expense over the term of the notes 
also included in the million loss is a write off of million in debt issuance costs associated with the extinguished debt 
see note long term debt for further information 
provision for income taxes our net benefit for income taxes from continuing operations for fiscal and totaled million and million  respectively 
the benefit provision in these years arose principally from the reassessment of our global tax exposures  and the refunds associated with certain us  federal  state and foreign income taxes paid in prior years  partially offset by net income taxes payable in foreign jurisdictions 
we did not recognize a benefit for our fiscal and losses  since the resulting deferred tax asset does not meet the criteria for realization under sfas no 
our net benefit for income taxes from continuing operations for fiscal totaled million and arose principally from a change in the u 
s income tax laws that resulted in additional us income tax refunds related to the operating results of fiscal partially offsetting this federal income tax benefit were various provisions for income taxes payable in state and foreign jurisdictions 
we did not recognize a benefit for our fiscal loss  since the resulting deferred tax asset does not meet the criteria for realization under sfas no 
at june   we had gross deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences  tax losses  and tax credits of million 
the gross deferred tax assets are offset by a valuation allowance of million and deferred tax liabilities of million 
the valuation allowance of million includes million attributable to benefits of stock option deductions  which  if recognized  will be allocated directly to paid in capital 
at june   we had united states federal  state  and foreign jurisdictional net operating loss carryforwards of approximately billion  million and million  respectively 
the federal losses will begin expiring in fiscal year  the state losses will begin expiring in fiscal  and the foreign losses will begin expiring in fiscal year at june   we also had general business credit carryovers of approximately million for united states federal tax purposes  which will begin expiring in fiscal year  and state r d credits of million  which do not have fixed expiration dates 
there is a risk that our ability to use our existing carryforwards in the future could be limited and not available to offset income tax liabilities from future profits 
see risks that affect our business 
discontinued operations on april   we entered into a definitive agreement for the sale of our alias application software business to accel kkr  a technology focused private equity investment firm 
the transaction closed on june  as a result of this transaction  we have presented the operating results of alias as a discontinued operation for all periods presented 
we received million in gross proceeds from the sale and recorded a net gain of million 
also included in fiscal net income from discontinued operations are the operating results of alias representing million in net income after tax 
sgi transferred approximately employees to accel kkr as a result of the sale and has no liability related to alias that remained with us that would impact our results of operations or liquidity 
see note discontinued operations for further information 
impact of sgi japan transaction during the second quarter of fiscal  we sold a equity interest in sgi japan to nec and nec soft 
this transaction affected our fiscal results in several ways 
as a minority shareholder  we no longer consolidate the financial results of sgi japan 
we also recognize revenue based on the contractual distribution price of products sold to sgi japan  which for the initial term of our year distribution agreement is based on historical pricing 
gross margins are negatively affected by the shift to distributor pricing  which is lower than the price to ultimate customers  offset to some extent by the amortization of the deferred revenue of million that was allocated to the estimated fair value of the exclusive distribution agreement 
this deferred revenue is being recognized as revenue over a three year period beginning in the third quarter of fiscal off balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business  we entered into off balance sheet arrangements as defined by the sec final rule fr  disclosure in management s discussion and analysis about off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations  including certain guarantees and indemnifications 
none of these off balance sheet arrangements either has  or is reasonably likely to have  a material current or future effect on financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
see note guarantees  to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding these guarantees and indemnifications 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at june   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
this table excludes amounts already recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as current liabilities at june  payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations senior secured convertible notes due june  convertible subordinated debentures due february  japanese yen fixed rate loan due december payable in quarterly installments   senior convertible notes due september   senior secured notes due june   capital lease obligation  operating lease obligations     purchase obligations    total      capital lease obligation represents a capital lease of servers for our global enterprise resource planning erp system 
operating lease obligations consist primarily of non cancelable operating leases including facilities vacated as part of our restructuring activities and exclude the benefit of sublease income 
these obligations primarily relate to the sublease of our amphitheatre technology center campus see note 
purchase obligations include all commitments to purchase goods or services of either a fixed or minimum quantity that meet any of the following criteria they are non cancelable  we would incur a penalty if the agreement was cancelled  or we must make specified minimum payments even if we do not take delivery of the contracted products or services take or pay 
if the obligation to purchase goods or services is non cancelable  the entire value of the contract is included in the table above 
if the obligation is cancelable  but we would incur a penalty if cancelled  the dollar amount of the penalty is included as a purchase obligation 
contracted minimum amounts specified in take or pay contracts are also included in the above table as they represent the portion of each contract that is a firm commitment 
excluding long term debt obligations  totals do not include contractual obligations recorded on the balance sheet as liabilities 
for the purpose of this table  contractual obligations for purchase goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable prices provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
the expected timing of payment of the purchase obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information 
timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods and services or changes to agreed upon amounts for some obligations 
financial condition at june   unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and marketable investments totaled million compared with million at june  the balance sheet at june  and june  also reflects approximately million and million  respectively  of restricted investments 
restricted investments at june  and june  consisted of short and long term investments pledged as collateral against bank credit facilities 
the increase in cash and cash equivalents compared with the prior year is primarily the result of our fiscal investing and financing activities  including the sale of our alias application software business and the sale of common stock through a private placement transaction  offset in part by cash consumed in operations 
the decrease in cash and cash equivalents in fiscal compared with the fiscal was primarily due to operating and investing activities 
primarily as a result of net losses  operating activities from continuing operations used million in cash in fiscal  compared with using million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
net loss for each of the past three years was adjusted for income from discontinued operations in order to present cash flows from operating activities from continuing operations 
net loss for fiscal was also adjusted to remove the impact of a million gain on the disposition of discontinued operations 
we further adjusted net loss from continuing operations for the following significant non cash items a million loss on the early extinguishment of tendered debt  million in depreciation and amortization  million in asset impairments associated with restructuring activities and million in interest expense associated with the induced conversion of a portion of our senior secured convertible notes 
fiscal net loss from continuing operations was adjusted to remove the impact of million in depreciation and amortization  a million loss on the sale of corporate real estate and million in asset impairments associated with restructuring activities 
fiscal net loss from continuing operations was adjusted to remove the impact of million in depreciation and amortization  million in asset impairments associated with restructuring activities and a million gain from the sale of a interest in sgi japan that was reflected as a cash flow from investing activities 
the negative operating cash flows from continuing operations in fiscal  and were primarily a result of continued restructuring actions and declining revenue levels 
cash payments for severance and contractual and facilities obligations related to restructuring actions totaled approximately million  million and million  respectively 
these restructuring actions are expected to result in additional future cash outlays of approximately million  of which approximately million are projected to occur in fiscal in addition to the impact of restructuring actions  negative operating cash flows in fiscal  and fiscal were primarily due to declining revenue levels which had a corresponding impact on our deferred revenue and accounts receivable balances 
decreased accounts receivable balances were also attributable to increased focus on customer cash collections and improved cash management programs that helped to improve our days sales outstanding from an average of days in fiscal to days in fiscal and to days in fiscal decreased inventory levels also caused by declining revenue levels and increased focus on tight management of inventory in fiscal and helped to offset negative operating cash flows in these fiscal years 
in fiscal  despite declines in revenue levels and improvements in manufacturing inventory management  an increase in demonstration systems inventory contributed to negative operating cash flows from continuing operations 
investing activities  other than changes in our marketable and restricted investments  provided million in cash during fiscal the principal investing activities during fiscal were the sale of our alias application software business for proceeds of million and the sale of our manufacturing facility in cortaillod  switzerland for proceeds of million 
these proceeds were partially offset by million in capital expenditures and a million increase in other assets including debenture costs 
investing activities  other than changes in our marketable and restricted investments  consumed million in cash during fiscal the principal investing activities during fiscal consisted of increases in other assets including prepaid software licenses  equity income resulting from our investment in sgi japan and capital expenditures of million  offset in part by million in proceeds received from the sale of land 
investing activities  other than changes in our marketable and restricted investments  provided million in cash during fiscal among the principal investing activities of fiscal were the sale of a interest in sgi japan for proceeds of million and the sale of corporate real estate and other assets for proceeds of million  which were offset in part by capital expenditures of million 
financing activities over the past three years have included the repayment of debt and the issuance of common stock in a private placement transaction and under employee stock purchase and option plans 
financing activities during fiscal provided million compared with using million and million during fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the principal financing activity during fiscal was the sale of approximately million shares of our common stock to certain institutional investors in a private placement transaction 
the transaction resulted in an aggregate purchase price of million and net proceeds of million 
during fiscal  we also completed an exchange offer under which we issued million principal amount of senior secured convertible notes and senior secured notes both due in exchange for notes that would otherwise have matured in september in connection with this transaction  we repaid million of our debt and paid approximately million of debt issuance costs 
principal financing activities during fiscal included million in debt payments  partially offset by million in proceeds from the sale of common stock through the employee stock purchase plan and employee stock options 
the principal financing activities during fiscal included the retirement of a million mortgage on our manufacturing facility in switzerland and the non cash restructuring of the yen denominated debt from million to million in the second quarter in conjunction with the sale of a majority equity interest in sgi japan 
we have incurred net losses and negative cash flows from operations during each of the past several fiscal years 
at june   our principal sources of liquidity included unrestricted cash and marketable investments of million  up from million at june  we also experience significant intra quarter fluctuations in our cash levels due to timing differences between our payments to vendors and our collections from customers  with the result that our cash balances are generally at their highest point at the end of each quarter and significantly lower at other times 
as a result  we continue to focus on expense controls and working capital efficiencies to maintain adequate levels of unrestricted cash within each quarter 
the terms of our existing indebtedness may affect our operating flexibility  including our ability to raise additional capital if needed we have an asset based credit facility that matures in april that we use for the purpose of issuing letters of credit supporting certain lease obligations 
the facility is secured by our us and canadian accounts receivable  us inventory and equipment  certain intellectual property and million cash collateral 
we also deposit additional cash whenever eligible accounts receivable and other collateral fluctuate below the level needed to secure our letters of credit 
at june   this facility was secured by a total of million cash collateral 
at june   we also have outstanding million aggregate principal amount of senior secured convertible notes and senior secured notes  both due in covenants in the credit facility require us to maintain minimum levels of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  or ebitda  minimum cash and cash equivalents levels  and set maximum capital expenditure levels 
the credit facility and the indentures governing the secured notes also contain covenants that  among other things  limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness  issue or pay dividends on capital stock  repurchase capital stock or prepay or repurchase subordinated debt 
a failure to comply with these covenants could entitle the lender to accelerate the underlying obligations 
on several occasions during fiscal and we were in violation of financial and administrative covenants in the credit facility or its predecessor facility  including for the fourth quarter of fiscal when we failed to meet the required ebitda level 
in each case we received a waiver of compliance from the lender 
we are committed to our goal of re establishing profitable operations and positive cash flow 
while a forecast of future events is inherently uncertain  we believe that the combination of our current resources and cash expected to be generated from our fiscal financial plan will be sufficient to meet our financial obligations through fiscal if we experience a material shortfall versus our plan for fiscal  we expect to take all appropriate actions to ensure the continuing operation of our business and to mitigate any negative impact on our profitability and cash reserves 
we believe that we have a range of actions we can take to achieve this outcome  including but not limited to expense related actions such as further reductions in headcount related expenses  additional consolidation of administrative functions and re evaluation of our global distribution model 
we also believe that we can take actions to generate cash by licensing intellectual property  seeking funding from marketing partners and key government customers  and seeking further equity or debt financing from strategic partners or financial sources 
beyond fiscal  the adequacy of our resources will depend largely on our success in re establishing profitable operations and positive operating cash flows 
see risks that affect our business 
critical accounting policies and estimates sgi s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate these estimates  including those related to customer programs and incentives  bad debts  inventory  lease residual values  warranty obligations  restructuring  income taxes and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates 
management has discussed the development and selection of the following critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to them 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
for all of these policies  we caution that future events often do not develop exactly as forecasted  and that even the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
revenue recognition 
a majority of our revenue is derived from sales that are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
certain revenue is generated from contracts where we are obligated to deliver multiple products and or services 
in these instances  we must assess the arrangement to determine whether the elements of the arrangement should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes and if so  how the total contract price should be allocated among the elements and when revenue should be recognized for each element 
we recognize revenue for delivered elements only when there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items and customer acceptance  if applicable  has been obtained 
allocation of the total contract price between each element of the arrangement may impact the timing of revenue recognition  but will not change the total revenue recognized on the contract 
certain contracts involving multiple elements may be delivered over a longer duration of time 
in these instances  we typically recognize revenue using the proportional performance method 
in applying the proportional performance method  we recognize revenue as work progresses  based on the percentage that incurred costs to date bear to estimated total costs 
we apply this method when we can obtain reasonably reliable estimates of contract costs 
as work progresses on these contracts we adjust our cost estimates as the facts warrant 
the profit on the contracts is subject to revision over the life of the contract 
the impact of these revisions are recorded to revenue and cost of goods sold in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
product warranties 
we provide for the estimated cost to warrant our products against defects in materials and workmanship at the time revenue is recognized 
we estimate our warranty obligation based on factors such as product lifecycle analysis and historical experience  and our estimate is affected by data such as product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
on a quarterly basis  these estimates are reviewed and adjusted as considered necessary based on the factors noted above 
over the past three years  changes in product warranties estimates have decreased the reserve by approximately million in both fiscal and while increasing the reserve by approximately thousand in fiscal manufacturing inventory and spare parts 
we write down our manufacturing inventory for estimated excess  obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value 
at the end of each quarter  we perform an in depth excess and obsolete analysis of all manufacturing inventory parts on order and on hand based upon assumptions about future demand and current market conditions 
for all spare parts on hand  our analysis is based on assumptions about product life cycles  historical usage  current production status and installed base 
additional adjustments to manufacturing inventory and parts may be required if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by us during the analyses 
lease residual values 
effective beginning in the second half of fiscal  we now retain a residual interest in the products sold under certain lease arrangements  representing the estimated fair market value of the equipment at the end of the lease term 
the residual value is derived for each significant product family based upon the following factors historical data regarding recovery of residual values  current assessment of market conditions for used equipment  and any forward looking projections deemed significant  particularly those relating to upcoming technology or changing market conditions 
residual values are evaluated periodically to determine if other than temporary declines in estimated residual values are indicated 
any anticipated increase in future residual values is not recognized until the used equipment is remarketed 
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the estimates include severe changes in the used equipment market and unforeseen changes in technology 
bad debts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
when we become aware of a specific customer s inability to pay their outstanding obligation for reasons such as deterioration in their operating results or financial position or bankruptcy proceedings  we record a specific reserve for bad debt to reduce their receivable to an amount we reasonably believe is collectible 
if the financial condition of specific customers were to change  our estimates of the recoverability of receivables could be further adjusted 
we also record allowances for doubtful accounts for all other customers based on a variety of factors including the length of time the receivables are past due and historical experience 
on a quarterly basis  these estimates are reviewed and adjusted as considered necessary based on the criteria noted above 
restructuring 
in recent fiscal years  we have recorded significant accruals in connection with our restructuring programs 
these accruals include estimates of employee separation costs and the settlements of contractual obligations  including lease terminations resulting from our actions 
accruals associated with vacated facilities and related asset impairments are estimated in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies and sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  respectively 
estimates may be adjusted upward or downward upon occurrence of a future triggering event 
triggering events may include  but are not limited to  changes in estimated time to sublease  sublease terms and sublease rates 
due to the extended contractual obligations of certain of these leases and the inherent volatility of commercial real estate markets  we expect to make future adjustments to these vacated facilities accruals 
over the past three years  various triggering events have caused our estimates to decrease by million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
income taxes 
estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets  which arise from temporary differences and carryforwards 
we regularly assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized from recoverable income taxes or recovered from future taxable income based on the realization criteria set forth under sfas  accounting for income taxes  and we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe to be more likely than not realizable 
in addition  the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary  the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary 
if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment  a further charge to expense would result 
loss contingencies 
we record an obligation for loss contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
contingent liabilities are often resolved over long time periods and there is a reasonable probability that the ultimate loss will differ from and perhaps exceed the recorded provision 
estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors that often depend on judgments about the outcome of pending lawsuits and potential actions by third parties including government agencies 
over the past two years  we have resolved lawsuits whereby the ultimate outcome caused us to partially reverse previously recorded contingent liabilities in the amount of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
other significant accounting policies 
other significant accounting policies not involving the same level of measurement uncertainties as those discussed above  are nevertheless important to an understanding of the financial statements 
policies regarding financial instruments  stock based compensation and consolidation require difficult judgments on complex matters that are often subject to multiple sources of authoritative guidance 
certain of these matters are among topics currently under reexamination by accounting standards setters and regulators 
although no specific conclusions reached by these standards setters appear likely to cause a material change in our accounting policies  outcomes cannot be predicted with confidence 
recent accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
 which addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities vie s either that do not have sufficient equity investment at risk to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support  or in which the equity investors lack an essential characteristic of a controlling financial interest 
in december  the fasb completed deliberations of proposed modifications to fin revised interpretations resulting in multiple effective dates based on the nature as well as the creation date of the vie 
vies created after january   but prior to january   may be accounted for either based on the original interpretation or the revised interpretations 
the revised interpretations have been applied to our second quarter of fiscal vie s created after january  must be accounted for under the revised interpretations 
we have not entered into any material arrangements with vie s created after january  the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
if we enter into any such arrangement with a variable interest entity in the future  our consolidated financial position or results of operations may be adversely impacted 
risks that affect our business sgi operates in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of risks  some of which are beyond our control 
our success will require continued revenue growth from newer product families  including the sgi altix product family 
the sgi altix family of servers and superclusters based on the intel itanium processor and the linux operating system was introduced in january and additional products in this line have been added during fiscal in fiscal  we plan to expand our advanced graphics product line to include visualization systems based on linux  itanium  and sgi s scalable graphics technology 
risks associated with these new product lines include dependence on intel in terms of price  supply  performance  product roadmaps and timely access to design specifications  the availability of linux applications optimized for the bit itanium platform or our scalable systems architecture  acceptance of the linux operating system in demanding environments  and competition from other suppliers of intel based servers  including clusters of low end servers 
our high performance systems segment reported year over year revenue growth in fiscal  primarily as a result of altix and storage product performance  while total company revenues declined six percent 
future revenue growth from our newer product families is especially important because revenues from our traditional mips and irix products and maintenance business have been declining at a faster rate than we have been able to increase sales of newer products 
our ability to achieve future revenue growth will depend significantly on the market success of these newer product families in servers  storage and visualization 
if one or more of the product lines were to fail in the market  it could have an adverse effect on our business 
we are concentrating our r d investments 
as an increasing percentage of our r d and marketing budget is devoted to potential growth areas  including the sgi altix family  visualization and storage  a declining amount both in percentage and absolute terms is being devoted to the traditional mips and irix products  which continue to supply the bulk of our revenue 
managing this transition without unduly compromising the competitiveness of the mips and irix family and the quality of support received by customers will be key to our success 
there can be no assurance that this transition will not impair our customer relationships and our competitive position 
we have been incurring losses and consuming cash in our operations 
we have incurred net losses and negative cash flows from operations during each of the past several fiscal years 
at june   our principal source of liquidity was unrestricted cash and marketable investments of million  up from million at june  we expect to continue to consume cash from operations in the first quarter of fiscal due to the significant intra quarter fluctuations in our cash levels that result from timing differences between our payments to vendors and our collections from customers  our cash levels tend to be at their highest at the end of the quarter 
as a result  we continue to focus on expense controls and working capital efficiencies to maintain adequate cash levels 
see financial condition 
the terms of our debt obligations may limit our ability to raise additional capital and may adversely affect our business 
we have an asset based credit facility and two series of outstanding secured notes that may be declared to be in default and accelerated if we fail to meet certain financial and other covenants 
see financial condition 
on several occasions during fiscal and  including the fourth quarter of fiscal  we were in violation of financial or administrative covenants under the credit facility 
although in each case we received a waiver from the lender  there can be no assurance that such a waiver will be available on acceptable terms in the event of a future default 
if a default is declared and not waived or if the facility matures and is not renewed  we may not be able to obtain alternative sources of financing on acceptable terms 
the need to comply with the terms of our debt obligations may also limit our ability to obtain additional financing and our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industry 
in the future  we may need to obtain additional financing to fund our business or repay our debt  and we cannot assure you that financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us 
in addition  if funds are raised by incurring further debt  our operations and finances may become subject to further restrictions and we may be required to limit our service or product development activities or other operations  or otherwise modify our business strategy 
if we obtain additional funds by selling any of our equity securities or if we issue equity derivative securities in connection with obtaining debt financing  the percentage ownership of our stockholders will be reduced  stockholders may experience additional dilution  or the equity securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to the common stock 
our disclosure controls and procedures need improvement 
our independent auditors  ernst young llp  advised us in connection with the completion of their audit for fiscal that they had identified certain matters involving the operation of our internal controls that they consider to be a material weakness 
see item a 
controls and procedures elsewhere in this form k 
we are in the process of implementing changes to respond to these matters  as well as evaluating  documenting and testing our internal controls in anticipation of our required compliance at june with section of the sarbanes oxley act of until we are able to effectively correct the identified material weakness  there could be a risk of accounting errors  which could have an adverse affect on our operations or financial results 
there is no guarantee that the changes we implement will be effective 
we may become involved in intellectual property disputes 
we routinely receive communications from third parties asserting patent or other rights covering our products and technologies 
based upon our evaluation  we may take no action or may seek to obtain a license 
we are in discussions with several parties that have asserted intellectual property infringement claims 
in any given case there is a risk that a license will not be available on terms that we consider reasonable  or that litigation will ensue 
we expect that  as the number of hardware and software patents issued continues to increase  and as competition in the markets we address intensifies  the volume of these intellectual property claims will also increase 
in addition  our increasing visibility as a supplier of linux based systems and as a participant in the open source software community increases our risk of becoming embroiled in the intellectual property disputes concerning these subjects  such as the current widely reported litigations between sco group on the one hand and ibm and red hat on the other 
we received a notice from sco group purporting to terminate as of october  our fully paid license to certain unix operating system related code  under which we distribute our irix operating system  on the basis that we have breached the terms of such license 
we believe that the sco group s allegations are without merit and that our fully paid license is non terminable 
nonetheless  there can be no assurance that this dispute with sco group will not escalate into litigation  which could have a material adverse effect on sgi  or that sco group s intellectual property claims will not impair the market acceptance of the linux operating system 
we are increasingly dependent on the technical cooperation of our partners 
our strategy of developing system products based on industry standard technologies has increased our dependence on intel and other partners 
it is important that we receive appropriate technical cooperation from intel and other partners  and that the products from these partners continue to evolve in ways that support the differentiation that we seek to bring to our products 
the competitiveness of our system products  particularly our servers  is also significantly affected by the availability on our platform of third party software applications that are important to customers in our target markets 
over the last few years  sgi has made a strategic shift towards open standards and away from proprietary technology 
our ability to achieve success with our linux based products and services is dependent on a number of factors including  but not limited to the growth of the linux market  the acceptance of linux solutions by customers in demanding environments  the availability of linux applications optimized for the bit itanium platform or our scalable systems architecture and our dependence on acceptance of sgi developed code by the open source community and by linux distributors with whom we partner 
our dependence on third party partners and suppliers  including sole source suppliers  may prevent us from delivering an acceptable product on a timely basis 
we rely on both single source and sole source suppliers for many of the components we use in our products 
our business is dependent on our ability to anticipate our needs for components and products and our suppliers ability to deliver such components and products in time to meet critical manufacturing and distribution schedules 
our business could be adversely affected  for example  if intel fails to meet product release schedules  if we experience supply constraints  or if we experience any other interruption or delay in the supply chain which interferes with our ability to manufacture our products or manage our inventory levels 
risks also include limited bargaining flexibility and the possibility of charges for excess and obsolete inventory 
we are currently focused on maximizing our working capital by working closely with our suppliers and tightly managing our overall supply chain 
we are dependent on sales to the us government 
a significant portion of our revenue is derived from sales to the us government  either directly by us or through system integrators and other resellers 
sales to the government present risks in addition to those involved in sales to commercial customers  including potential disruptions due to changes in appropriation and spending patterns 
the us government can typically terminate or modify its contracts with us at any time for its convenience 
any disruption or limitation in our ability to do business with the us government could have an adverse impact on sgi 
a portion of our business requires security clearances from the us government 
we have implemented measures to maintain our clearances in light of the fact that our chairman and chief executive officer  robert bishop  is an australian citizen 
these arrangements are subject to periodic review by customer agencies and the defense security service of the department of defense 
we expect our operating results to fluctuate for a variety of reasons 
our revenue and operating results may fluctuate for a number of reasons from period to period 
decreases in revenue can arise from any number of factors  including decreased demand  supply constraints  delays in the availability of new products  transit interruptions  overall economic conditions  competitive factors  military or terrorist actions  or natural disasters 
demand can also be adversely affected by concerns specifically associated with our financial health and by product and technology transition announcements by us or our competitors 
the timing of customer acceptance of certain large scale server products may also have a significant effect on periodic operating results 
margins are heavily influenced by revenue levels  mix considerations  including geographic concentrations  the mix of product and service revenue  industry price trends  and the mix of server and desktop product revenue as well as the mix of configurations within these product categories 
as a result of the concentration of sales in the third month of each quarter  developments late in a quarter can have a significant impact on that period s results 
our typical concentration of sales at the end of our fiscal quarters makes period to period financial results less predictable 
over half of each quarter s product revenue results from orders booked and shipped during the third month  and disproportionately in the latter half of that month 
this makes the forecasting of revenue inherently uncertain and can produce pressure on the company s internal infrastructure during the third month of a quarter 
because we plan our operating expenses  many of which are relatively fixed in the short term  on expected revenue  even a relatively small revenue shortfall may cause a period s results to be substantially below expectations 
we are subject to the risks of international operations 
we generate a large portion of our revenue outside of the united states  and as a result  our business is subject to the risks associated with doing business internationally 
war  terrorism or public health issues in the regions of the world in which we do business have caused and may continue to cause damage or disruption to commerce by creating economic and political uncertainties 
such events could adversely affect our business in any number of ways  such as decreasing demand for our products  increasing our costs of operations  making it difficult to deliver products to customers  and causing delays and other problems in our supply chain 
our future revenue  gross margin  expenses and financial condition could also suffer due to other international factors  including but not limited to changes in a country s economic and labor conditions  currency fluctuations  changes in tax laws  changes in the regulatory or legal environment  difficulties associated with repatriating cash generated abroad  fluctuations in transportation costs  natural and medical disasters  and trade protection measures 
many of our international sales require export licenses 
our sales to customers outside the united states are subject to us export regulations 
sales of many of our high end products require clearance and export licenses from the us department of commerce under these regulations 
our international sales would be adversely affected if such regulations were tightened  or if they are not modified over time to reflect the increasing performance of our products 
the swiss authorities are investigating compliance with their export regulations in connection with exports from the swiss manufacturing facility that was closed during the second quarter of fiscal we believe that this matter will be resolved without a significant adverse effect on our business  operating results or financial condition 
we may not be able to develop and introduce new products on a timely basis 
meeting our objectives for the future will require that our recently introduced products achieve success in the marketplace and that we succeed in the timely development and introduction of more successful new products 
product transitions are a recurring part of our business 
a number of risks are inherent in this process 
the development of new technology and products is increasingly complex and uncertain  which increases the risk of delays 
the introduction of new computer systems requires close collaboration and continued technological advancement involving multiple hardware and software design teams  internal manufacturing teams  outside suppliers of key components such as semiconductors and outsource manufacturing partners 
the failure of any one of these elements could cause our products under development to fail to meet specifications or to miss the aggressive timetables that we establish 
there is no assurance that development or acceptance of our new systems will not be affected by delays in this process 
short product life cycles place a premium on our ability to manage the transition to new products 
we often announce new products in the early part of a quarter while the product is in the final stages of development and testing  and seek to manufacture and ship the product in volume during the same quarter 
our results could be adversely affected by such factors as development delays  the release of products to manufacturing late in any quarter  quality or yield problems experienced by suppliers  variations in product costs and excess inventories of older products and components 
in addition  some customers may delay purchasing existing products in anticipation of new product introductions 
most products are upgraded during their product life cycle 
the ability to upgrade products in a timely fashion is necessary to compete in the computer industry 
delay in introducing updates and upgrades can adversely affect acceptance and demand for product 
downward fluctuations in the price of our common stock may cause our common stock to be delisted 
during fiscal we were notified by the new york stock exchange that we were not in compliance with its requirement that listed securities trade at a minimum per share price of averaged over a thirty day trading period 
our stock price subsequently increased to more than  but if it were to decline again and not recover  the nyse could terminate the listing of our common stock 
our stock price has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile 
as of august   the week range for our stock price was to 
declines in the price of our common stock may be caused by our failure to meet the investment community s expectations for quarterly revenue or earnings or by broader market trends unrelated to our performance 
delisting would adversely affect the liquidity and market price of our common stock 
we operate in a highly competitive industry 
the computer industry is highly competitive  with rapid technological advances and constantly improving price performance 
most of our competitors have substantially greater technical  marketing and financial resources 
they also generally have a larger installed base of customers and a wider range of available applications software 
competition may result in significant discounting and lower gross margins 
in addition  as our linux based systems business grows  the number of our competitors may grow commensurate with the increased market opportunity 
specifically  certain pc vendors market products that can be clustered together to produce systems that compete with our mid range products 
these clustered systems may not be subject to us export regulations  which may make them more attractive to certain international customers 
see many of our international sales require export licenses 
we may not be able to retain and attract qualified employees 
our success depends on our ability to continue to attract  retain and motivate highly qualified technical  sales and marketing and management personnel 
the uncertainties surrounding our business prospects and our continuing restructuring actions have increased the challenges of retaining world class talent 
we implemented further restructuring actions during fiscal and the first quarter of fiscal as we continue to work through the turnaround process  there is no guarantee that we will not lose highly qualified employees or that we will be able to hire highly qualified candidates  as new skills are needed 
we may not be able to utilize a significant portion of our net operating loss and credit carryforwards 
we have generated a significant amount of us net operating loss carryforwards due to prior period losses 
us and state income tax laws limit the amount of these carryforwards a company can utilize upon a greater than cumulative shift of stock ownership over a three year period 
the issuance of additional common stock  in financing transactions or on conversion of our outstanding convertible bonds such as the senior convertible notes issued in december  will count towards this cumulative ownership shift 
there is a risk that our ability to use our existing carryforwards in the future could be limited  and not available to offset income tax liabilities from future profits 
this would have an effect on our cash balances and liquidity and would reduce our income after taxes 
this would not affect our future effective tax rate since any affected loss and credit carryforwards have been subjected to a valuation allowance in prior periods 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  our financial position is routinely subjected to a variety of risks  including market risk associated with interest rate movements and currency rate movements on non us dollar denominated assets and liabilities  as well as the collectibility of accounts receivable 
we regularly assess these risks and have established policies and business practices to protect against the adverse effects of these and other potential exposures 
as a result  we do not anticipate material losses in these areas 
our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our convertible subordinated notes 
fixed rate securities and borrowings may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to fluctuations in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest our excess cash in high quality money market instruments and debt instruments and  by policy  restrict our exposure to any single corporate issuer by imposing concentration limits 
to minimize the exposure due to adverse shifts in interest rates  we maintain investments at an average maturity of generally less than three years 
for purposes of specific risk analysis  we use sensitivity analysis to determine the impact that market risk exposures may have on the fair values of our debt and financial instruments 
the financial instruments included in the sensitivity analysis consist of all of our cash and cash equivalents  marketable investments  short term and long term debt and all derivative financial instruments 
currency forward contracts and currency options constitute our portfolio of derivative financial instruments 
to perform sensitivity analysis  we assess the risk of loss in fair values from the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates on market sensitive instruments 
we compute the market values for interest risk based on the present value of future cash flows as impacted by the changes in rates attributable to the market risk being measured 
we selected the discount rates used for the present value computations based on market interest rates in effect at june  we computed the market values for foreign exchange risk based on spot rates in effect at june  the market values that result from these computations are compared to the market values of these financial instruments at june  the differences in this comparison are the hypothetical gains or losses associated with each type of risk 
the results of the sensitivity analysis at june  are as follows interest rate risk a percentage point decrease in the levels of interest rates with all other variables held constant would result in an increase in aggregate fair values of our financial instruments by million at june  a percentage point increase in the levels of interest rates with all other variables held constant would result in a decrease in aggregate fair values of our financial instruments by million at june  foreign currency exchange rate risk a strengthening of foreign currency exchange rates against the us dollar with all other variables held constant would result in a decrease in the fair values of our financial instruments by million june  a weakening of foreign currency exchange rates against the us dollar with all other variables held constant would result in an increase in the fair values of our financial instruments by million at june  the financial instruments measured in the foreign currency exchange rate sensitivity analysis are used in our hedging program to reduce our overall corporate exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates
