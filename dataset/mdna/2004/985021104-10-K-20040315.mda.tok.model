limitations on payment of dividends under applicable new jersey law  the company is not permitted to pay dividends on its capital stock if  following the payment of the dividend  it would be unable to pay its debts as they become due in the usual course of business or its total assets would be less than its total liabilities 
further  it is the policy of the frb that bank holding companies should pay dividends only out of current earnings 
since it has no significant independent sources of income  the ability of the company to pay dividends is dependent on its ability to receive dividends from the bank 
under national banking laws  the bank must obtain the approval of the occ before declaring any dividend which  together with all other dividends declared by the bank in the same calendar year will exceed the total of the bank s net profits of that year combined with its retained net profits of the preceding years  less any required transfers to surplus or a fund for the retirement of any preferred stock 
net profits are to be calculated without adding back any provision for the bank s allowance for loan losses 
furthermore  the bank  as an fdic insured institution  may not pay dividends or make distributions that would cause the institution to fail to meet minimum capital requirements 
these restrictions would not prevent the bank from paying dividends from current earnings to the company at this time 
in addition  as a bank whose deposits are insured by the fdic  the bank may not pay dividends or distribute any of its capital assets while it remains in default of any assessment due to the fdic 
the bank is not in default under any of its obligations to the fdic 
federal regulators also have authority to prohibit banks and bank holding companies from paying a dividend if they deem such payment to be an unsafe or unsound practice 

table of contents effect of government monetary policies the earnings of the company are and will be affected by domestic economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the united states government and its agencies 
the frb has had  and will likely continue to have  an important impact on the operating results of commercial banks through its power to implement national monetary policy in order  among other things  to curb inflation or combat a recession 
the frb has a major effect upon the levels of bank loans  investments and deposits through its open market operations in united states government securities and through its regulation of  among other things  the discount rate on borrowings of member banks and the reserve requirements against member banks deposits 
it is not possible to predict the nature and impact of future changes in monetary and fiscal policies 
usa patriot act the usa patriot act  adopted in  authorizes the secretary of the treasury  in consultation with the heads of other government agencies  to adopt special measures applicable to financial institutions 
among its provisions  the usa patriot act requires each financial institution to establish an anti money laundering program  establish due diligence policies  procedures and controls that are reasonably designed to detect and report instances of money laundering in united states private bank accounts and correspondent accounts maintained for non united states persons or their representatives  and avoid establishing  maintaining  administering or managing correspondent accounts in the united states for  or on behalf of  a foreign bank that does not have a physical presence in any country 
in addition  the usa patriot act expands the circumstances under which funds in a bank account may be forfeited and requires covered financial institutions to respond under certain circumstances to request for information from federal banking agencies within hours 
the usa patriot act also amended the bank holding company act and the bank merger act to require federal banking regulators to consider the effectiveness of a financial institution s anti money laundering activities when reviewing an application under those acts 
the department of treasury has issued regulations implementing the due diligence requirements of the usa patriot act 
these regulations require minimum standards to verify customer identity and maintain accurate records  encourage cooperation among financial institutions  federal banking agencies  and law enforcement authorities regarding possible money laundering or terrorist activities  prohibit the anonymous use of concentration accounts  and require all covered financial institutions to have in place an anti money laundering compliance program 
sarbanes oxley act the president signed into law the sarbanes oxley act of  which addresses  among other issues  corporate governance  auditing and accounting  executive compensation and enhanced and timely disclosure of corporate information 
the sec  in response to the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act and on its own initiative  has promulgated additional rules relating to disclosure and security holder communications  among other matters 
the nasdaq stock market has also adopted corporate governance rules that have been approved by the sec 
the changes required by the sarbanes oxley act and new sec and nasdaq rules are intended to allow stockholders to more easily and efficiently monitor the performance of companies and directors 
the company and its board of directors are reviewing these changes and  where applicable  adopting or modifying policies and practices in order to assure compliance with the regulatory requirements and to enhance our corporate governance 
other laws and regulations the company and the bank are subject to a variety of laws and regulations which are not limited to banking organizations 
in lending to commercial and consumer borrowers  and in owning and operating its own property  the bank is subject to regulations and potential liabilities under state and federal environmental laws 
legislation and regulatory changes legislation and regulations may be enacted which increase the cost of doing business  limit or expand permissible activities  or affect the competitive balance between banks and other financial services providers 
proposals to change the laws and regulations governing the operations and taxation of banks  bank holding companies  and other financial institutions are frequently made in congress and before various bank regulatory agencies

statistical disclosure the company s statistical disclosure information  required of bank holding companies  is contained in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  which is set forth in item of this report 

table of contents risk factors the following is a discussion of certain significant risk factors that could potentially negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations 
we may not be able to continue to grow our business  which may adversely impact our results of operations 
during the last five years  our total assets have grown substantially from billion at december  to billion at december  our business strategy calls for continued expansion  but we do not anticipate growth to continue at this rate 
our ability to continue to grow depends  in part  upon our ability to open new branch locations  successfully attract deposits to existing and new branches and identify favorable loan and investment opportunities 
in the event that we do not continue to grow  our results of operations could be adversely impacted 
we may not be able to manage our growth  which may adversely impact our financial results 
as part of our expansion strategy  we plan to open new branches in our existing and target markets 
however  we may be unable to identify attractive locations on terms favorable to us or to hire qualified management to operate the new branches  and the organizational and overhead costs may be greater than we anticipated 
in addition  we may not be able to obtain the regulatory approvals necessary to open new branches 
the new branches may take longer than expected to reach profitability  and we cannot assure you they will become profitable 
the additional costs of starting new branches may adversely impact our financial results 
our ability to manage growth successfully will depend on whether we can continue to fund this growth while maintaining cost controls and asset quality  as well as on factors beyond our control  such as national and regional economic conditions and interest rate trends 
if we are not able to control costs and maintain asset quality  such growth could adversely impact our earnings and financial condition 
the company s continued pace of growth may require it to raise additional capital in the future  but that capital may not be available when it is needed 
the company is required by federal regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support its operations 
the company anticipates that existing capital resources will satisfy its capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
however  the company may at some point need to raise additional capital to support continued growth 
the company s ability to raise additional capital  if needed  will depend on conditions in the capital markets at that time  which are outside the company s control  and on its financial performance 
accordingly  the company cannot assure you of its ability to raise additional capital if needed or on terms acceptable to the company 
if the company cannot raise additional capital when needed  the ability to further expand its operations could be materially impaired 
our exposure to credit risk  because we focus on commercial lending  could adversely affect our earnings and financial condition 
there are certain risks inherent in making loans 
these risks include interest rate changes over the time period in which loans may be repaid  risks resulting from changes in the economy  risks inherent in dealing with borrowers and  in the case of a loan backed by collateral  risks resulting from uncertainties about the future value of the collateral 
commercial loans are generally viewed as having a higher credit risk than residential real estate or consumer loans because they usually involve larger loan balances to a single borrower and are more susceptible to a risk of default during an economic downturn 
commercial and industrial loans and commercial real estate loans  which comprise our commercial loan portfolio  were of our total loan portfolio at december  construction and development loans  which are included as part of our commercial real estate loans  were of our total loan portfolio at december  construction financing typically involves a higher degree of credit risk than commercial mortgage lending 
risk of loss on a construction loan depends largely on the accuracy of the initial estimate of the property s value at completion of construction compared to the estimated cost including interest of construction 
if the estimated property value proves to be inaccurate  the loan may be undersecured 
because our loan portfolio contains a significant number of commercial real estate loans and commercial and industrial loans with relatively large balances  the deterioration of one or a few of these loans may cause a significant increase in nonperforming loans 
an increase in nonperforming loans could cause an increase in the provision for loan losses and an increase in loan charge offs  which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents adverse economic and business conditions in our market area may have an adverse effect on our earnings 
substantially all of our business is with customers located within mercer county and contiguous counties 
generally  we make loans to small to mid sized businesses  most of whose success depends on the regional economy 
these businesses generally have fewer financial resources in terms of capital or borrowing capacity than larger entities 
adverse economic and business conditions in our market area could reduce our growth rate  affect our borrowers ability to repay their loans and  consequently  adversely affect our financial condition and performance 
further  we place substantial reliance on real estate as collateral for our loan portfolio 
a sharp downturn in real estate values in our market area could leave many of our loans undersecured 
if we are required to liquidate the collateral to satisfy the debt securing a loan during a period of reduced real estate values  our earnings could be adversely affected 
if our allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses  our earnings would decrease 
in an attempt to mitigate any loan losses we may incur  we maintain an allowance for loan losses based on  among other things  national and regional economic conditions  and historical loss experience and delinquency trends among loan types 
however  we cannot predict loan losses with certainty and we cannot assure you that charge offs in future periods will not exceed the allowance for loan losses 
in addition  regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  review our allowance for loan losses and may require additions to the allowance based on their judgment about information available to them at the time of their examination 
factors that require an increase in our allowance for loan losses could reduce our earnings 
loss of our key personnel or an inability to hire and retain qualified personnel could adversely affect our business 
our future operating results are substantially dependent on the continued service of patrick m 
ryan  our president and chief executive officer  jay g 
destribats  our chairman of the board  and other key personnel 
the loss of the services of mr 
ryan would have a negative impact on our business because of his lending expertise and years of industry experience 
in addition  the loss of the services of mr 
ryan or mr 
destribats could have a negative impact on our business because of their business development skills and community involvement 
our success also depends on the experience of our branch managers and our lending officers and on their relationships with the communities they serve 
the loss of these or other key persons could negatively impact our banking operations 
although we have employment agreements with mr 
ryan  mr 
destribats and our other key personnel  our employees may voluntarily terminate their employment at any time 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our key personnel or attract the qualified personnel necessary for the management of our business 
changes in interest rates may adversely affect our earnings and financial condition 
our net income depends primarily upon our net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on loans  investments and other interest earning assets and the interest expense incurred on deposits and borrowed funds 
different types of assets and liabilities may react differently  and at different times  to changes in market interest rates 
we expect that we will periodically experience gaps in the interest rate sensitivities of our assets and liabilities 
that means either our interest bearing liabilities will be more sensitive to changes in market interest rates than our interest earning assets  or vice versa 
when interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly than interest earning assets  an increase in market rates of interest could reduce our net interest income 
likewise  when interest earning assets mature or reprice more quickly than interest bearing liabilities  falling interest rates could reduce our net interest income 
we are unable to predict changes in market interest rates  which are affected by many factors beyond our control  including inflation  recession  unemployment  money supply  domestic and international events and changes in the united states and other financial markets 
we may not be able to successfully integrate acquisitions  which may adversely affect our business 
we intend to consider future strategic acquisitions  some of which could be material to us and which may include companies that are substantially equivalent or larger in size compared to us 
we continually explore and conduct discussions with third parties regarding possible acquisitions 
as of the date of this report  we have not entered into any definitive agreement and we do not have any definitive plans relating to any specific acquisitions 
we will have to integrate any acquisitions into our business 
the difficulties of combining the operations  technologies and personnel of companies we acquire include coordinating and integrating geographically separated organizations and integrating personnel with diverse business backgrounds 
we may not be able to effectively manage or integrate the acquired companies 
further  we may not be successful in implementing appropriate operational  financial and management systems and controls to achieve the benefits expected to result from these acquisitions 
our efforts to integrate these businesses could be affected by a number of factors beyond our control  such as regulatory developments  general economic conditions and increased competition 
in addition  the process of integrating these businesses could cause an interruption of  or loss of momentum in  the activities of our existing business and the loss of key personnel and customers 
the diversion of management s attention and any delays or difficulties encountered in connection with the transition and integration of these businesses could negatively impact our business and results of operations if any of the above adverse effects were to occur 
further  the benefits that we anticipate from these acquisitions may not be obtained 

table of contents competition from other financial institutions in originating loans and attracting deposits may adversely affect our profitability 
we face substantial competition in originating loans 
this competition comes principally from other banks  savings institutions  mortgage banking companies and other lenders 
many of our competitors enjoy advantages  including greater financial resources and higher lending limits  a wider geographic presence  more accessible branch office locations  the ability to offer a wider array of services or more favorable pricing alternatives  as well as lower origination and operating costs 
this competition could reduce our net income by decreasing the number and size of loans that we originate and the interest rates we may charge on these loans 
in attracting deposits  we face substantial competition from other insured depository institutions such as banks  savings institutions and credit unions  as well as institutions offering uninsured investment alternatives  including money market funds 
many of our competitors enjoy advantages  including greater financial resources  more aggressive marketing campaigns and better brand recognition and more branch locations 
these competitors may offer higher interest rates than we do  which could decrease the deposits that we attract or require us to increase our rates to retain existing deposits or attract new deposits 
increased deposit competition could adversely affect our ability to generate the funds necessary for lending operations and increase our cost of funds 
we also compete with non bank providers of financial services  such as brokerage firms  consumer finance companies  insurance companies and governmental organizations which may offer more favorable terms 
some of our non bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations that govern our operations 
as a result  such non bank competitors may have advantages over us in providing certain products and services 
this competition may reduce or limit our margins on banking services  reduce our market share and adversely affect our earnings and financial condition 
government regulation significantly affects our business 
the banking industry is extensively regulated 
banking regulations are intended primarily to protect depositors  consumers and the federal deposit insurance funds  not stockholders 
we are subject to regulation and supervision by the board of governors of the federal reserve system 
the bank is subject to regulation and supervision by the office of the comptroller of the currency 
regulatory requirements affect our lending practices  capital structure  investment practices  dividend policy and growth 
the bank regulatory agencies possess broad authority to prevent or remedy unsafe or unsound practices or violations of law 
we are subject to various regulatory capital requirements  which involve both quantitative measures of our assets and liabilities and qualitative judgments by regulators regarding risks and other factors 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements or comply with other regulations could result in actions by regulators that could adversely affect our ability to pay dividends or otherwise adversely impact operations 
in addition  changes in laws  regulations and regulatory practices affecting the banking industry may limit the manner in which we may conduct our business 
such changes may adversely affect us  including our ability to offer new products and services  obtain financing  attract deposits  make loans and achieve satisfactory spreads and impose additional costs on us 
as a public company  we are also subject to the corporate governance standards set forth in the sarbanes oxley act of  as well as any rules or regulations promulgated by the sec or the nasdaq stock market  inc we continually encounter technological change  and we may have fewer resources than many of our competitors to continue to invest in technological improvements  which could reduce our ability to effectively compete 
the financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes with frequent introduction of new technology driven products and services 
in addition to better serving customers  the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to reduce costs 
our future success will depend  in part  upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services to enhance customer convenience  as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations 
many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to effectively implement new technology driven products and services  which could reduce our ability to effectively compete 
our hardware and software systems are vulnerable to damage that could harm our business 
we rely upon our existing information systems for operating and monitoring all major aspects of our business  including deposit and loan information  as well as various internal management functions 
these systems and our operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters  power loss  network failure  improper operation by our employees  security breaches  computer viruses or intentional attacks by third parties 
any disruption in the operation of our information systems could adversely impact our operations  which may affect our results of operations and financial condition

results of operations overview we are a billion financial holding company headquartered in hamilton  new jersey 
we operate full service branches through our wholly owned banking subsidiary  the yardville national bank  in mercer  hunterdon  somerset  middlesex and burlington counties in new jersey and bucks county  pennsylvania 
our existing and target markets are located in the demographically attractive corridor between new york city and philadelphia 
we provide a broad range of lending and deposit products as well as other financial products and services with an emphasis on commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans to small to mid sized businesses 
we generate substantially all of our income from our loan and securities portfolios 
our earning asset base is primarily funded through deposits  and to a lesser degree  borrowed funds 
our primary objective is to increase our net interest income 
to accomplish this  we must continue to lower our cost of funds and expand our loan portfolio 
our most difficult challenge is attracting more deposits at a reasonable cost 
as our legal lending limit has risen  the size of loans requested has increased as well  exerting pressure on our branch network to provide the funds for our growth 
by implementing our retail strategy  we have increased the number of branches in our target markets  enhanced our brand image and introduced our products and services to an expanded geographic region 
this strategy  however  requires investment of resources in people  facilities  marketing and technology 
while we have seen many positive results  including a lower cost of funds  we have not yet fully realized all of the benefits of this strategic direction 
our commitment to the retail strategy did  however  contribute to the rise in non interest expenses of million in compared to during  we opened three new branches  including our first two in somerset county  and completed the first branch acquisition in our history  which further expanded our retail network in mercer county 
we believe that by expanding our geographic footprint and attracting lower cost deposits to fund our growth  we will enhance profitability and the value of our franchise 
despite strong growth in lower cost core deposits and commercial real estate loans  which resulted in net interest income growth of million in  profitability was hampered primarily due to two large loan charge offs and the resultant provision for loan losses in the fourth quarter 
we earned net income of million or per diluted share for the year ended december   compared to million or per diluted share for the year ended december  this represents a decrease of and  respectively 
the decrease in net income of million in was due to a million increase in the provision for loan losses  a million increase in non interest expenses  and million decline in net securities gains  partially offset by net interest income growth of million 
the decrease in diluted earnings per share was attributable to both lower net income and to the significantly greater number of weighted average shares outstanding due to the full year impact in of the december stock offering 

table of contents during the last quarter of  we charged off approximately million of a million commercial loan relationship after the borrower advised us that it had determined to cease operations 
in addition  approximately million of an million commercial loan relationship with another borrower was also charged off in the fourth quarter 
the resultant provision for loan losses of million for the fourth quarter of  primarily from these two loan relationships  negatively impacted earnings for overall credit quality  however  remained relatively strong with nonperforming assets of million  or of total assets at december  compared to million  or of total assets at the same date in one of the primary goals of our retail strategy is to lower our cost of interest bearing liabilities and increase net interest income 
as a result of our retail strategy and a continued lower interest rate environment  our cost of liabilities decreased million 
total deposits increased million or to billion at december  from billion at the end of comparatively lower cost average savings  money markets and interest bearing demand deposits increased million during also contributing to the growth in net interest income was loan growth 
total loans  led by commercial real estate loans  increased to billion compared with billion at the end of to monitor our financial performance  we review several profitability measurements which include return on average assets roa and return on average stockholders equity roe 
our roa decreased to from in  while roe decreased to in from in due primarily to our earnings performance 
we expect the pace of our earnings growth to substantially increase in due to our projected commercial loan growth  anticipated lower cost of funds  and controlled growth of non interest expenses  which should result in significant improvement to these two profitability ratios 
our efficiency ratio increased to in from in the efficiency ratio is calculated by dividing total operating expenses by net interest income and other income 
our higher level of net interest income was offset by higher expenses from our retail strategy  growth  costs associated with originating loans and compliance with new regulations  all of which had a negative impact on our efficiency ratio 
while we are disappointed in the financial results  we anticipate that our financial performance will rebound in we have taken steps to limit the growth in our largest non interest expense category  salaries and employee benefits 
expense control and fee collection initiatives instituted in the second half of should contribute to an improving bottom line 
we believe the combination of a lower cost of funds  double digit commercial loan growth and a return to our traditional loan quality performance should result in improved earnings performance in critical accounting policies our accounting policies are integral to understanding the results reported 
accounting policies are described in detail in note  summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the disclosures included in this annual report are based on our audited consolidated financial statements 
these statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
these estimates result in judgments regarding the carrying values of assets and liabilities where these values are not readily available from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate the estimates used  including the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
we believe our policies with respect to the determination of the allowance for loan losses involve a high degree of complexity and require us to make difficult and subjective judgments which often require assumptions or estimates about highly uncertain matters 
the allowance for loan losses is determined based on our assessment of several factors reviews and evaluations of specific loans  current economic conditions  historical loan loss experience and the level of classified and nonperforming loans 
net interest income net interest income is the largest and most significant component of our operating income 
net interest income is the difference between income on interest earning assets and expense on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income depends upon the relative amount and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and the interest rate earned or paid on them 
net interest income is also impacted by changes in interest rates and the shape of market yield curves 
the following table sets forth an analysis of net interest income by each major category of average interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the related yields and costs for the years ended december     and average yields for each year are derived by dividing income by the average balance of the related assets  and average costs are derived by dividing expense by the average balance of the related liabilities 
the yields and costs include fees  costs  premiums and discounts  which are considered adjustments to interest rates

for the purpose of calculating loan yields  average loan balances include nonaccrual loans with no related interest income 
the interest rate spread is the difference between the average yield on interest earning assets and the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the net interest margin is equal to net interest income divided by average interest earning assets 
in order to present pre tax income and resultant yields on tax exempt investments and loans on a basis comparable to those on taxable investments and loans  a tax equivalent adjustment is made to interest income 
the tax equivalent adjustment has been computed using a federal income tax rate of and has the effect of increasing interest income by     and  for the years ended december      and  respectively

net interest income totaled million in  an increase of million or from net interest income of million in a lower cost on interest bearing liabilities of basis points decreased interest expense by million in this decrease in interest expense was the primary reason for the improvement in net interest income in compared to the same period in also contributing to the improvement in net interest income were increased volumes of loans offset by lower yields on interest earning assets 
in  the interest rate spread increased basis points to 
the net interest margin  on a tax equivalent basis  increased basis points to from in the net interest margin is generally greater than the interest rate spread due to the additional income earned on those assets funded by non interest bearing liabilities  primarily demand deposits and stockholders equity 
during  interest income rose to million  compared to million for average interest earning assets increased by million or to billion for  compared to billion in the growth in average interest earning assets was mostly offset by a basis point decline in the yield on average earning assets to for as compared to for the historically low interest rate environment that existed in remained for and resulted in continued pressure on earning asset yields 
loans averaged billion for representing an increase of million  or when compared with billion for during this same period  loan yields declined basis points to  partially offsetting higher loan balances 
interest and fees on loans increased in compared to the composition of our commercial loan portfolio  which includes commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans  contributed to the decrease in the overall loan yield 
approximately of our commercial loans have floating rates typically tied to the prime rate of interest 
in  the average prime rate declined to compared to in further impacting loan yields in were the lower rates earned on fixed rate loans 
the performance of the loan portfolio is expected to be enhanced in a gradually increasing interest rate environment 
the level of nonaccrual loans also impacted our loan yield and net interest income 
historically  the level of nonaccrual loans in our portfolio has had a minimal negative impact to net interest income and our net interest margin 
nonaccrual loans totaled million at december   an increase of million from the million reported in had these nonaccrual loans performed at original contract terms  we would have recognized additional interest income of approximately  in and  in moreover  our net interest margin  on a tax equivalent basis  would have been higher in and higher in the improvement to our net interest margin was not as great as expected due principally to the significant decrease in the yield on the securities portfolio 
interest on securities declined million as the yield on the securities portfolio decreased basis points to in from in there were several factors which contributed to the lower securities yield in the most significant factors deal with the largest segment of our securities portfolio  mortgage backed securities 

table of contents higher than projected prepayment speeds resulted in significant cash flows throughout prepayment activity in the second half of shortened the anticipated average life of our mortgage backed securities 
this required acceleration of premium amortization on mortgage backed securities  particularly collateralized mortgage obligations cmos  led to a significantly lower yield on these securities 
the reinvestment of principal cash flows in a lower interest rate environment resulted in lower yields on newly purchased securities during to a lesser extent  the reinvestment of higher yielding callable bond proceeds and the elimination by the federal home loan bank of new york fhlb of their fourth quarter dividend also contributed to the lower yield on securities in the third quarter dividend income received from the fhlb was approximately  see securities for additional information 
during  interest expense declined by million  or to million when compared to million in  while our overall funding costs were reduced by basis points to during this same period 
the low interest rate environment reduced our funding costs as generally higher cost time deposits repriced lower to market levels or were replaced by lower cost savings  money market and interest bearing demand deposits 
also contributing to our lower funding costs was the increase in non interest demand deposits in partially offsetting the decline in interest expense during was a million  or  increase in average interest bearing liabilities 
our greater focus on retail banking  in addition to our strength in establishing long term business relationships  has resulted in an increase in core business and personal checking accounts in growth in average demand deposits of million or to million in positively impacted our net interest margin 
average savings  money market and interest bearing demand deposits increased million  or to million during this past year 
the corresponding cost of funds on those deposits declined basis points to 
average time deposits decreased million during  with the related cost of funds declining by basis points to 
the combination of lower interest rates and the change in composition of our interest bearing deposits led to the basis point decline in the cost of these deposits to for compared to average total borrowings increased by million  or to million during  while related borrowing costs declined by basis points to 
during  we paid off million in fhlb advances at their maturity dates 
the retirement of million in higher cost advances and the lower cost of floating rate advances resulted in the lower interest expense on borrowed funds in compared to average total subordinated debentures increased by million to million during however  the interest expense associated with these subordinated debentures declined basis points and reduced interest expense by  in the first quarter of  we retired million of fixed rate subordinated debentures with a cost of 
correspondingly  we issued floating rate subordinated debentures of million in the first quarter and subsequently an additional million of floating rate subordinated debentures in the third quarter 
the interest rate  priced off of libor  for the floating rate subordinated debentures issued in the first and third quarters of  was and  respectively  at december  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
over the last several years  we have followed a strategy that manages a portion of our investment portfolio utilizing borrowed funds with the primary objectives of enhancing return on average stockholders equity and earnings per share  called the investment growth strategy 
with our focus clearly on enhancing the value of our franchise  this strategy  while successful  has been significantly reduced in importance 
the amount of securities managed in this strategy totaled only million or of our assets at december  compared to million  or of our assets at december  the targeted spread on this strategy  after tax  has resulted in a negative impact on our net interest margin of approximately basis points in compared to basis points in improving our net interest margin in is critical to achieving our profitability goals 
our cost of funds  which has historically been higher than most peers  has continued to decline as we continue the execution of our retail strategy 
the expansion of our branch network in new and existing markets  the enhancement of our brand image and the targeted marketing of successfully introduced products eg simply better checking are expected to further increase core deposits  lower the cost of funds and improve our net interest margin 
the impact of higher cost fhlb advances currently on our balance sheet are expected to be reduced over time 
from an earning asset perspective  changes were made in the latter half of regarding securities purchases as described below 
based on the size of our floating rate commercial loan portfolio  the duration of our securities portfolio was extended during the latter part of mortgage backed securities  with projected stable cash flows  were purchased in the third and fourth quarters at levels at or close to par 
this should reduce the securities yield fluctuations experienced in the second and third quarters of due to large premium amortization writedowns 
these actions have positioned our securities portfolio to perform better in in either a stable  or a gradually increasing or decreasing  interest rate environment 
provision for loan losses we provide for possible loan losses by a charge to current income to maintain the allowance for loan losses at an adequate level determined according to our documented allowance adequacy methodology 
the provision for loan losses totaled million for an increase of million when compared to million for  with the increase attributable to the two loan charge offs previously discussed  the increase in nonperforming loans and the overall loan growth 
the allowance for loan losses increased by  to million compared to million at the end of the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was at december  compared with at december  see asset quality and allowance for loan losses for additional detail and information 

table of contents non interest income in  the major components of non interest income consisted of service charges on deposit accounts  income on bank owned life insurance boli  net securities gains and other service fees 
non interest income totaled million in compared to million in  a decrease of  or non interest income  excluding securities gains and the sale of our former operations building  rose  or to million for when compared to million for the increase was achieved through higher service charge income and other service related fees of  due to a greater number of transactional deposit accounts and the expansion of our customer base using fee based services 
additional income on boli of  contributed to the increase in non interest income in the components of non interest income are presented in the following table 
year ended december  in thousands service charges on deposit accounts income on bank owned life insurance securities gains  net other service fees investment and insurance fees other non interest income total service charges on deposit accounts represent the largest single source of core non interest income 
service charges on deposit accounts increased  due principally to increased income from overdraft fees and to additional branch locations generating a larger base of transaction accounts 
we intend to continue targeted marketing campaigns to attract lower cost or non interest demand deposit accounts designed to continue to lower our cost of funds and generate additional service charge and transactional fee income 
we provide deferred compensation plans for executive management and for non employee directors 
to offset the costs associated with these plans  we have purchased boli assets 
income on boli assets are tax free  providing a high rate of return relative to alternative earning assets  and reducing our overall effective tax rate 
the increase in boli earnings in was primarily due to the purchase of an additional million of boli assets in december there were no boli assets purchased in there are no further premiums paid associated with boli assets after their initial purchase 
earnings on boli assets are impacted by the interest crediting rate determined on an annual basis by the insuring companies 
net securities gains realized during were million compared to million in greater securities gains were realized in when longer term fixed rate securities were sold to achieve the goal of reducing longer term interest rate risk in a rising interest rate environment 
repositioning securities continued in to achieve asset and liability objectives  which include enhancing interest income in future periods 
we also generate non interest income from a variety of fee based services 
these include automated teller machine fees charged to non customers  second check fees and check fees 
other service fees increased to million in from million in other non interest income totaled  in  an increase of  when compared to  in accounting for this increase was the sale of our former operations building to a board member  which resulted in a  gain  and to a lesser extent  income derived from mortgage servicing and safe deposit box rentals 
non interest income  excluding securities gains and the sale of our former operations building  represented of total revenues in compared to in in  we offered enhanced internet and cash management products and services to our customers 
while it will take time to build our non interest income base  we did experience modest success in increasing investment and insurance fee income in as we expand our footprint into new markets  our greatest opportunity to increase non interest income will come through the addition of checking accounts  which we believe will result in additional service fee income 
non interest expense non interest expense consists of salaries and employee benefits  occupancy  equipment and all other operating expenses we incur 
non interest expense totaled million in  an increase of million or compared to million in the largest increases in non interest expense in were primarily in salaries and employee benefits  equipment  marketing and other expenses 
as illustrated in the following table  the increases in the various major components of non interest expense are reflective of our continued growth in a highly regulated environment 
as we continue to grow and implement our retail strategy  the investments we make in personnel  training and branch facilities and equipment  have at times preceded our realization of the full benefits of our investment

we continued to increase lending  administrative  product support and risk management staffing during also included in the increase of salary expense were annual merit increases 
full time equivalent employees increased to at december  from at december  employee benefit expense totaled million  an increase of  or from increases in benefits costs were primarily related to higher health benefit costs on a larger employee base  higher payroll taxes  and the expenses for our employee stock ownership plan esop 
net occupancy expense increased  or to million in from million in total rent expense on leased properties and buildings repairs and maintenance increased  and  respectively  and were the primary reasons for the increase in occupancy expense in the increases in rent expense and other facility related expenses was primarily due to the full year s occupancy expenses associated with three new branches opened in three additional branches  opened in  also contributed to higher occupancy expenses 
opening new branches in target markets is an important component of our retail strategy 
equipment expense increased  or to million in from million in the increase in equipment expense was primarily related to additional equipment maintenance and depreciation costs 
the costs associated with automated teller machines have also risen as our branch network has grown 
marketing expenses increased by  or in to million  compared to million in the increase in marketing expenses was attributable to focused marketing campaigns designed to increase low cost deposits  further develop our brand image  and our continued support of community activities 
other expenses were primarily comprised of costs associated with the origination of commercial loans  bad check and fraud losses  community reinvestment act expenses  various professional fees and other operating expenses 
other expenses totaled million in compared to million in also included in other expenses is the deposit intangible amortization from our purchase of a branch in december 
we paid a premium of approximately on deposits totaling approximately million 
that expense is estimated to be approximately  in we continuously assess the efficiency of our operations  seeking ways to best serve our customers while reducing operating costs 
an important industry productivity measure is the efficiency ratio 
an increase in the efficiency ratio can indicate that more resources are being utilized to generate the same volume of income while a decrease would indicate a more efficient use of resources 
ynb s efficiency ratio increased in to compared to in excluding net securities gains and the sale of our former operations building in  our efficiency ratio was and for and  respectively 
increasing net interest income and effectively managing the level of non interest expenses are key strategies to lower our efficiency ratio in income taxes the provision for income taxes  comprised of federal and state income taxes  was million in compared to million in the provisions for income taxes for and were at effective tax rates of and  respectively 
the decrease in tax expense was due to lower taxable income 
our effective tax rate declined principally due to higher levels of tax exempt income  and tax benefits from ownership of certain real estate assets used by the bank in a real estate investment trust subsidiary 

table of contents financial condition total assets our assets were billion at december  compared to billion at year end  an increase of million or 
the growth in ynb s asset base during was primarily due to an increase in commercial real estate loans 
average loans grew by in we believe in establishing and building relationships in the communities we serve 
our emphasis and strength as a business focused community lender is reflected in our balance sheet growth over the last several years 
our growth is supported by the renewed focus on our retail strategy 
headquartered in mercer county for over three quarters of a century  we have expanded our philosophy of community relationship banking into the demographically attractive markets of hunterdon  somerset and middlesex counties in new jersey 
we have expanded lower cost core deposits  strengthened our brand image and enhanced the value of our franchise 
average interest earning assets in were billion  an increase from billion in the growth in average interest earning assets was principally funded by the increase in lower cost savings  money market and interest and non interest bearing demand deposits 
loans we continue to emphasize commercial real estate and commercial and industrial lending to individuals and small to mid sized businesses 
our strength as a commercial lender  relationship banking philosophy and expansion into new markets has resulted in robust commercial loan growth 
from december  to december   we increased loans from million to billion resulting in a compound annual growth rate exceeding 
the expansion of our capital base has resulted in a higher legal lending limit  which has enabled us to attract larger loan relationships and increased business from existing customers 
we continue to stress quality growth and product and industry diversification  while maintaining strict underwriting standards

a majority of commercial loans are secured by real estate and business assets  and most are supported by the personal guarantees and other assets of the principals 
we monitor the composition and quality of the overall commercial loan portfolio including significant credit concentrations by borrower or industry 

table of contents commercial real estate loans increased by million  or in to million from million at december  commercial real estate loans consist of owner occupied  investor occupied  and construction and development loans 
investor occupied and owner occupied loans grew by million and million  respectively  in growth in commercial real estate loans accounted for of the total loan growth in compared to in  and was primarily attributable to new and expanded business relationships developed as a result of our expansion into new markets  as well as greater penetration in existing markets 
commercial real estate loans generally have a final maturity of five to fifteen years 
construction and development loans include residential and commercial projects 
loans are typically made to experienced residential or commercial construction developers 
residential construction loans include single family  multi family  and condominium projects 
commercial construction loans include office and professional development  retail development and other commercial related projects 
generally  construction loan terms run between one and two years and are interest only  adjustable rate loans indexed to the prime rate 
real estate underwriting standards include various limits on loan to value ratios based on the type of property and consideration of the creditworthiness of the borrower  the location of the real estate  the condition of the security property  the quality of the organization managing the property  and the viability of the project including occupancy rates  tenants and lease terms 
additionally  underwriting standards require appraisals  periodic inspections of the properties and ongoing monitoring of operating results 
collateral values are established based upon independently prepared appraisals

our residential mortgage loans are secured by first liens on the underlying real property 
we are a participating seller and servicer with the federal national mortgage association fnma and the federal home loan mortgage corporation fhlmc and we generally underwrite our single family residential mortgage loans to conform with standards required by these agencies 
multi family loans  which represented million of the total  primarily consist of loans secured by apartment complexes 
commercial and industrial loans include term loans  lines of credit  and demand loans

the expansion of our retail network has generated additional opportunities to increase the size of our consumer loan portfolio 
substantially all of our business is with customers located within mercer county and contiguous counties 
changes in the region s economic environment and real estate market conditions could adversely affect loan growth

a sharp downturn in real estate values in our market area could leave many of our loans undersecured 
if we are required to liquidate the collateral to satisfy the debt securing a loan during a period of reduced real estate values  our earnings could be adversely affected 
adverse economic and business conditions in our market area could reduce our growth  affect our borrowers ability to repay their loans  and consequently  adversely affect our financial condition and performance 
in the last quarter of  we charged off approximately million of a million commercial loan relationship after the borrower determined to cease operations 
at this time  we do not anticipate additional material charge offs on this relationship 
in addition  approximately million of an million commercial loan relationship to another borrower was charged off in the fourth quarter 
we are continuing to work closely with this borrower to reach a resolution 
the ultimate collectibility of the remaining balance  however  cannot be determined at this time 
our overall asset quality trends  excluding the two loan relationships above  have remained relatively strong 
over the last several years  we have successfully grown our loan portfolio while maintaining high asset quality standards 
based on our strict underwriting standards  collateral based approach to lending and depth of lending experience  we are expecting a return to our traditional loan quality performance in the following table sets forth nonperforming assets in our loan portfolio by type for the years indicated 
nonperforming assets december  in thousands nonaccrual loans commercial real estate residential commercial and industrial consumer total nonaccrual loans restructured loans loans days or more past due residential commercial and industrial consumer total loans days or more past due total nonperforming loans other real estate total nonperforming assets nonperforming assets increased million to million at december  compared to million at december  for the five years ended december   ynb s nonperforming assets have averaged approximately million 
credit quality has remained relatively strong during periods of robust commercial loan growth 
nonperforming assets represented of total assets at december  and at december  the ratio was up modestly due primarily to the increase in nonperforming assets 
nonperforming assets as a percentage of total loans and other real estate were at december   compared to at december  due to the two large loan charge offs in the last quarter of  the ratio of net loan charge offs as a percent of average total loans increased to for the year ended december  compared to for the same period in nonperforming assets consist of nonperforming loans and other real estate owned 
nonperforming loans are comprised of loans on a nonaccrual basis  loans which are contractually past due days or more as to interest or principal payments but have not been classified as nonaccrual  and loans whose terms have been restructured to provide a reduction or deferral of interest or principal because of a deterioration in the financial position of the borrower 
our policy regarding nonaccrual loans varies by loan type 
generally  commercial loans are placed on nonaccrual when they are days past due  unless these loans are well secured and in the process of collection or  regardless of the past due status of the loan  when management determines that the complete recovery of principal or interest is in doubt 
consumer loans are generally charged off after they become days past due 
residential mortgage loans are not generally placed on nonaccrual status unless the value of the real estate has deteriorated to the point that a potential loss of principal or interest exists 
subsequent payments are credited to income only if collection of principal is not in doubt 
if principal and interest payments are brought contractually current  and future collectibility is reasonably assured  loans are returned to accrual status 

table of contents loans are classified as restructured loans when  for economic or legal reasons related to the borrower s financial condition  we grant concessions to the customer that we would not otherwise consider 
generally  this occurs when the cash flow of the borrower is insufficient to service the loan under its original terms 
restructured loans remain on nonaccrual until collectibility improves and a satisfactory payment history is established  generally at least six consecutive monthly payments 
nonperforming loans totaled million at december   an increase of million from the million at december  the increase in nonperforming loans resulted from an increase in nonaccrual loans 
nonaccrual loans were million  or of total loans at december   an increase of million from the december  total of million 
nonaccrual commercial and industrial loans represented approximately of total nonaccrual loans 
in addition to the two large charge offs previously discussed  approximately million of the total nonaccrual loans at december  are associated with the remaining balance of those two lending relationships 
there were no restructured loans at december  compared to  at december  based upon the satisfactory payment history  the restructured loan from was returned to accrual status in january nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets percentage at december   loans that were days or more past due but still accruing interest represented  or of total loans  compared to  or of total loans at december  management s decision to accrue interest on these loans is based on the level of collateral and the status of collection efforts 
in the fourth quarter of  our remaining two ore properties were sold 
there were no ore properties remaining on our books at december  this compares to million in ore at december  ore is reported at the lower of cost or fair value at the time of acquisition and at the lower of fair value  less estimated costs to sell  or cost thereafter 
our objective remains to maintain high credit standards that are reflected in our financial results 
we believe that the relatively low level of nonperforming assets we have experienced over the past five years is indicative of our sound credit culture  which includes strict underwriting standards  active loan review  and strong credit policies 
while we believe the events of the fourth quarter to be isolated  a number of factors beyond our control could cause nonperforming asset levels to rise from their current or historical levels  which would have a negative impact on our financial performance 
allowance for loan losses we have identified the allowance for loan losses to be a critical accounting policy 
based on internal reviews and valuations performed by our lending staff we rate substantially all of our loans based on their respective risk 
these evaluations are  in turn  examined by our internal loan review staff 
a formal loan review function is in place  independent of loan origination  to identify and monitor risk classifications 
our emphasis on commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans has provided higher earnings 
these loans  however  entail greater risk than residential mortgage and consumer loans 
the primary emphasis in our risk rating system is on commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans 
risk is measured by use of a matrix  which is customized to measure the risk of each loan type 
risk ratings of to are considered to be acceptable risk and consist of loans rated as either minimal  modest  better than average  average and acceptable 
loans with acceptable risk were reserved at a range of to at december  risk ratings of between and are considered higher than acceptable risk and consist of loans rated as special mention  substandard  doubtful and loss 
due to the higher level of risk  these loans were reserved at a range of to at december  loans with a risk rating of are considered to be a loss and would be reserved at 
at december   there were no rated loans 
residential mortgage loans were assigned an individual risk reserve percentage of due to the strong secured nature of these loans and the low levels of losses that have been experienced historically 
consumer loans were assigned reserve percentages of for the lowest risk to for the highest risk depending on the unsecured or secured status 
the reserve percentage assigned to each risk rating category is determined quarterly from historical loan loss rates based on an eight quarter rolling trend utilizing migration analysis 
in addition  we use our judgment concerning the anticipated impact on credit risk of economic conditions  real estate values  interest rates  level of business activity and other factors 
we closely monitor delinquencies and delinquency trends 
all criticized assets are reviewed on a quarterly basis 
allocations for the allowance for loan losses  both specific and general  are determined after this review 
we provide for possible loan losses by a charge to current income to maintain the allowance for loan losses at an adequate level according to our documented allowance adequacy methodology 
for additional information on the provision for loan losses see results of operations provision for loan losses

it is our assessment  based on our judgment and analysis  that the allowance was appropriate in relation to the credit risk at december  the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans was   and  at december    and  respectively 
another measure of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is the ratio of the allowance to total nonperforming loans 
at december   this ratio was versus at december  extending credit to businesses and consumers exposes us to credit risk 
we manage credit risk in the loan portfolio through adherence to strict underwriting standards  guidelines and limitations 
various approval levels  based on the amount of the loan and other credit considerations  have also been established 
we recognize that despite our best efforts to manage credit risk  losses will occur 
in times of economic slowdown  either within our markets or nationally  the risk inherent in our loan portfolio may increase 
the timing and amount of loan losses that may occur is dependent upon several factors  most notably current and expected general  regional and local economic conditions and the specific financial condition of our borrowers 
although we use the best information available  the level of the allowance for loan losses remains an estimate which is subject to significant judgment and short term changes 
allocation of the allowance for loan losses the following table describes the allocation of the allowance for loan losses among various categories of loans and certain other information as of the dates indicated 
an unallocated allowance is distributed proportionately among each loan category 
this unallocated portion of the loan loss allowance is important to maintain the overall allowance at a level that is adequate to absorb potential credit losses inherent in the total loan portfolio 
the allocation is made for analytical purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the categories in which future loan losses may occur 
the total allowance is available to absorb losses from any segment of loans

mbss represented of total securities at december  and provide a source of cash flows that are impacted by changes in interest rates 
during  we repositioned a portion of our afs portfolio out of shorter term us agency callable bonds and  to a lesser extent  corporate bonds  into longer term mbss to take advantage of the steepness of the treasury yield curve and enhance the yield of the afs portfolio 
these actions extended the duration of our securities portfolio from approximately years at the end of to approximately years at december  the amount of floating rate loans in our loan portfolio allowed us to extend the duration of the securities portfolio to increase the yield and protect interest income streams in a stable or falling rate environment 
our goal for managing the mbs portfolio is to obtain a dependable income stream and cash flows regardless of the interest rate environment

in a rising interest rate environment  mbs prepayment activity should decrease  extending the weighted average lives 
accordingly  we would be required to amortize net premiums into income over a longer period of time  thereby increasing mbs yields and net interest income 
conversely  the opposite would occur in a declining interest rate environment 
at december   we had total mbs balances of million  of which million were fixed rate 
at december   we had mortgage backed securities totaling million  of which million were fixed rate 
cmos represented million and million of total outstanding mbs balances at december  and  respectively 
lower interest rates in resulted in higher than projected prepayment speeds which generated substantially greater cash flows totaling million compared to million in during the latter half of  mbss were purchased at or close to par to mitigate the negative impact to mbs yields we were experiencing due to premium amortization 
these purchases were typically securities with stable cash flow projections and limited extension risk in a gradually rising interest rate environment

at december   we determined that all unrealized losses were temporary in nature 
this conclusion was based on several factors  including the strong credit quality of the securities with unrealized losses  the performing nature of these securities  and the low level and short time frame of the unrealized 
table of contents losses 
management believes that the unrealized losses in the securities portfolios were caused by changes in interest rates  market credit spreads  and perceived and actual changes in prepayment speeds on mortgage backed securities 
at december   there were issues that had unrealized losses of less than twelve months 
these issues included one us treasury bond  issues of agency callable bonds  agency named mortgage backed securities  including cmos  and obligations of state and political subdivisions tax free municipal bonds all of which had an investment grade rating at the time of purchase and at year end 
at december   there were eight issues that had unrealized losses of twelve months or longer 
three of the issues were agency named mortgage backed securities  including cmos  and one was a tax free municipal bond all of which had an investment grade rating at the time of purchase and at year end 
the remaining four issues were floating rate trust preferred securities issued by financial institutions 
all four of these issues were sold in february  which resulted in an approximate net loss of deposits deposits represent our primary funding source supporting earning asset growth 
in  we continued the expansion of our branch network in mercer county and opened our first branches in demographically attractive somerset county 
the continued strengthening of our brand image and targeted marketing of products and services has contributed to our success in attracting lower cost core deposits 
the successful bidding on surrogate s deposits in several new jersey counties and public fund accounts has helped strengthen liquidity and reduce the need for higher cost  time deposits 
we also believe that deposit growth has also benefited from the volatility in the financial markets 
in december  we completed the first branch acquisition in our history by acquiring the lawrence branch of first savings bank  a subsidiary of first sentinel bancorp  inc  further expanding ynb s retail network in our primary market of mercer county 
the acquisition added approximately million to our deposit base and has been well received by our new customers 
we paid a premium of approximately for these deposits 
total deposits grew to billion at december  compared to billion at year end  an increase of million or 
core deposit balances  which include non interest and interest bearing demand  savings  and money market deposits  increased during  with the growth primarily led by interest bearing demand deposits  money markets and non interest bearing demand deposits

by attracting and increasing balances in non interest demand deposits  we expect to continue to reduce our cost of deposits and increase net interest income 
during  average non interest bearing demand deposits increased by million  or to million from million for while we have experienced success in establishing new consumer interest bearing checking accounts and relationships  the increase in non interest bearing demand deposits was primarily attributable to the growth in new and existing business relationships 
the introduction of business dda plus to our small business customers contributed to the increase in balances 
average interest bearing demand and money market deposits in increased and  or million and million  respectively  as compared to average savings deposits also increased in there were two factors that led to the outstanding growth of average interest bearing demand deposits 
in  we introduced simply better checking in our northern region comprised 
table of contents of hunterdon  middlesex and somerset counties in new jersey  as well as in bucks county  pennsylvania 
simply better checking is a relationship oriented interest bearing demand deposit account with an above average interest rate during its initial six month period 
marketing and targeted direct mail supported the successful introduction of this product during for  net new accounts were opened with approximately million in balances 
also  in january  we were awarded approximately million in new surrogate s deposits through a competitive bidding process 
the average cost of these deposits was approximately 
approximately million of these deposits was up for bid in december in january  we were successful in retaining these deposits and added an additional million in new surrogate s deposits 
with time deposits less attractive in the current rate environment  depositors have continued to be attracted to our competitively priced premier money market account  supporting the growth in this segment of our deposit base 
the average cost of these deposits decreased basis points from in to in total deposits at year end dollars in millions total average time deposits  which consist of certificates of deposit of  or more and other time deposits  which include individual retirement accounts  decreased or million to million from million in the average months to maturity on the entire cd portfolio at december  was approximately months 
due to the repricing characteristics and pricing of time deposits in relation to other deposit products  the average cost of time deposits declined basis points in to from in we market cds through our branch network and nationally through a computer software based service and these cds totaled million at december  compared to million at year end while typically more costly than cds raised through our branch network  these cds have represented a dependable source of liquidity during times of increased loan demand 
the following table details amounts and maturities for certificates of deposit of  or more for the years indicated december  in thousands maturity range within three months after three months but within six months after six months but within twelve months after twelve months total the continued execution of our retail strategy is expected to attract lower cost core deposits  reduce our cost of funds  and raise net interest income levels 
the addition of new cash management services and the introduction of new deposit products to our business customers and to consumers in an expanding marketplace should have a positive impact on creating and expanding profitable customer and business relationships 
simply better checking was introduced in our primary mercer county marketplace in february based on our results in other markets we expect significant deposit growth in from this product 
competition in our markets  our ability to fund our loan growth with lower cost core deposits  and our customers desire to achieve the highest return possible on their money  could affect deposit growth  net interest income and our net interest margin 
borrowed funds while it is our preference to fund our asset growth through core deposits  we have utilized borrowed funds for our earning asset growth not supported by deposit generation and also for asset and liability and liquidity management purposes 
borrowed funds consist primarily of fhlb advances 
borrowed funds totaled million at december   a decrease of million or when compared to million at december  the decrease in borrowed funds was due to the decrease in fhlb advances 
at december   borrowed funds represented of our assets compared to at year end fhlb advances totaled million at december  compared to million at december  the million decrease in advances in was due to the maturity of advances totaling million in the first half of our fhlb advance portfolio  backed by securities and mortgages residential and commercial as collateral  includes callable advances that have terms of two to ten years and are callable after periods ranging from three months to five years 
callable borrowings totaled million at december   of which million have call dates in generally  when rates rise  some or all of these advances could be called and we expect would then need to be replaced with higher cost borrowings 
conversely  when interest rates fall  advances are not likely to be called 
based on our analysis at year end  we believe that an increase of basis points in interest rates in would not be likely to result in significant calls 
as a member of the fhlb  we have utilized advances for funding earning asset growth  enhancing liquidity  managing interest rate risk and funding the investment growth strategy 
fhlb advances require no deposit insurance premiums and operational overhead costs are considerably less than those associated with deposits 
there are  however  stock requirements associated with borrowings provided by the 
table of contents fhlb 
we currently own million of fhlb stock 
the fhlb of new york suspended its fourth quarter cash dividend  negatively impacting our net interest income in the last quarter 
although the dividend was reinstated in the first quarter of  however at a lower level  management will continue to monitor the financial health of the fhlb of new york and adjust funding strategies as needed 
borrowed funds also include  related to our employee stock ownership plan esop 
in may  the esop purchased  shares of our common stock from our k savings plan for approximately  borrowed funds averaged million in  an increase of million from the million average reported in the average cost of borrowed funds decreased basis points during the year to compared with in the retirement of million in higher cost advances and the lower cost of floating rate advances resulted in the lower interest expense on borrowed funds in compared to at december   we had million in fhlb advances backed by securities collateral and million backed by mortgage collateral 
as additional commercial and residential mortgages qualify as collateral  it is our intent to replace securities collateral with mortgage collateral when advances are renewed to enhance our liquidity profile 
in  million in fhlb advances  all libor based  will mature 
the average rate paid on those advances is approximately 
although our goal is to continue to reduce borrowed funds as a percentage of our funding base  we may continue to use borrowed funds  within approved policy guidelines  as an alternative funding source or to meet desired business  asset and liability  and liquidity objectives 
we have taken actions over the last several years which will mitigate future long term interest rate risk from fhlb advances 
with the de emphasis of the investment growth strategy  the use of year callable advances for that purpose has been eliminated 
in this historically low interest rate environment the higher cost callable fhlb advances have limited our ability to improve our net interest margin 
we have evaluated several options to reduce the cost of these borrowings 
should it become economically feasible we would retire or restructure all or a portion of these borrowings to improve future period earnings 
as our deposit base continues to grow  we expect borrowed funds  as a percentage of assets  to continue to diminish in importance 
contractual obligations  commitments  contingent liabilities  and off balance sheet arrangements the following table presents  as of december   our significant fixed and determinable contractual obligations by payment date 
the payment amounts represent those amounts contractually due to the recipient and do not include any unamortized premiums or discounts  or other similar carrying value adjustments 
payments due by period less than more than in thousands year years years years total contractual obligations time deposits borrowed funds subordinated debentures operating lease obligations other long term liabilities total in the normal course of business  we enter into certain contractual obligations 
such obligations include obligations to make future payments on debt and lease arrangements as well as payments on deferred compensation and postretirement benefits 
we have no capital lease obligations or other significant long term contractual obligations 
time deposits are shown at the maturity date 
borrowed funds include periodic payments of principal 
noncallable borrowed funds are shown at maturity date while callable borrowed funds are shown at either the call date  if a call was deemed likely at december   or otherwise at the maturity date 
subordinated debentures are shown at the maturity date 
we enter into a variety of financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and letters of credit  both of which involve  to varying degrees  elements of risk in excess of the amount reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
credit risk for letters of credit is managed by limiting the total amount of arrangements outstanding and by applying normal credit policies to all activities with credit risk 
collateral is obtained based on management s credit assessment of the customer 
the contract amounts of off balance sheet financial instruments as of december  and for commitments to extend credit were million and million  respectively  and for letters of credit  were million and million  respectively 
commitments to extend credit and letters of credit may expire without being drawn upon  and therefore  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash flow requirements 
further discussion of our other commitments and contingent liabilities is included in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  we have commitments and obligations under other postretirement benefit plans as described in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents asset and liability management the objective of asset and liability management is the prudent control of market risk  liquidity risk and the appropriate use of capital  while maximizing profitability 
one of the primary goals of asset and liability management is to prudently maximize net interest income 
the risk to net interest income is derived from the difference in the maturity and repricing characteristics between assets and liabilities 
market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
market risk arises principally from interest rate risk inherent in loans  securities  deposits and borrowings 
we seek to manage our asset and liability portfolios to help reduce any adverse impact on net interest income caused by fluctuating interest rates 
interest rate risk due to a sudden and significant change in interest rates may adversely impact our earnings to the extent that the interest rates of assets and liabilities do not change at the same speed  to the same extent or on the same basis 
accordingly  we actively analyze and manage our interest rate exposures 
our asset and liability committee alco provides oversight to the interest rate risk management process 
alco recommends policy guidelines regarding exposure to interest rates for approval by the board of directors 
adherence to these policies is monitored on an ongoing basis and decisions related to the management of interest rate exposure due to changes in balance sheet composition and or market interest rates are made when appropriate and agreed to by alco and approved by the board of directors 
the primary goal of our interest rate risk management is to control exposure to interest rate risk inherent in the balance sheet  determine the appropriate risk level given our strategic objectives  and manage the risk consistent with alco and the board of directors approved limits and guidelines 
these limits and guidelines reflect our tolerance for interest rate risk over both short and long term time horizons 
our alco meets monthly to discuss pertinent asset and liability issues 
on a quarterly basis  we provide a detailed review of our interest rate risk position to the board of directors 
we manage and control interest rate risk by identifying and quantifying interest rate risk exposures through the use of net interest income simulation and economic value at risk models 
both measures may change periodically as the balance sheet composition and underlying assumptions change 
we also use a traditional gap analysis that complements the simulation and economic value at risk modeling 
the gap analysis does not assess the relative sensitivity of assets and liabilities to changes in interest rates and also does not fully account for imbedded options  caps and floors 
the gap analysis is prepared based on the maturity and repricing characteristics of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities for selected time periods 
one measure of interest rate risk is the gap ratio  which is defined as the difference between the dollar volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within a specified period of time as a percentage of total assets 
a positive gap results when the volume of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds that of interest rate sensitive liabilities within comparable time periods 
a negative gap results when the volume of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds that of interest rate sensitive assets within comparable time periods 

table of contents the following table reflects our gap position at december  rate sensitive assets and liabilities december  six more than more than more than more than under months one year two years five years ten years six through through through through and not in thousands months one year two years five years ten years repricing total assets cash and due from banks federal funds sold and interest bearing deposits available for sale securities investment securities loans other assets  net total assets liabilities and stockholders equity non interest bearing demand savings and interest bearing demand money market certificates of deposit of  or more other time deposits total deposits borrowed funds subordinated debentures other liabilities stockholders equity total liabilities and stockholders equity gap cumulative gap cumulative gap to total assets as indicated in the table  our one year gap position at december  was 
the negative gap in the table above includes over million of at the money or in the money floors on prime related commercial loans 
these floors  for gap purposes  effectively convert these floating rate loans to fixed rate loans 
approximately million of the floor contracts expire within months 
should interest rates increase  and loan rates rise above their floors  the yield on these loans would increase 
this benefit to rising rates is not reflected in the gap table 
if this benefit were reflected  the effective one year gap position would become a positive 
gaps  as a static measurement  cannot capture the effects of options on earnings 
generally  a financial institution with a positive gap position will most likely experience an increase in net interest income during periods of rising rates and decreases in net interest income during periods of falling interest rates 
included in the analysis of our gap position are certain savings  money markets and interest bearing demand deposits  which are less sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates than other interest bearing sources of funds 
in determining the sensitivity of such deposits  we review the movement of our deposit rates over the last months relative to market rates 
historically  we had used regression analysis to determine deposit sensitivity  but due to the lower interest rate environment experienced over the last two years  recent pricing patterns are considered a more accurate tool 
simulation modeling the simulation model measures the volatility of net interest income to changes in market interest rates 
we dynamically model our interest income and interest expenses over specified time periods under different interest rate scenarios and balance sheet structures 
we measure the sensitivity of net interest income over and month time horizons  based on assumptions approved by alco and ratified by the board of directors 
the board has established certain policy limits for the potential volatility of net interest income as projected by the simulation model 
in our base case simulation  the composition of the balance sheet is kept static 
volatility is measured from a base case where interest rates are assumed to be flat and is expressed as the percentage change  from the base case  in net interest income over and month periods with a change in interest rates of plus and minus basis points over a month period and continuation of rates at that level for the second year 
due to the low interest rate environment  a minus basis point scenario was used 
the base case scenario is measured within a policy guideline of change in net interest income in year one and change in year two 
the following table reflects the estimated change in net interest income from the base case scenario for a one and two year period based on our december  balance sheet percentage change in net interest income change in market interest rates basis points flat basis points 
table of contents based on our simulation analysis we believe our interest rate risk position is fairly balanced over the next to months whether we experience either rising or falling interest rates 
our net interest income will benefit most from gradually rising interest rates 
changes in the composition of the balance sheet in have positioned net interest income levels to rise in and move our net interest margin higher in either a flat or rising rate environment 
by reducing our reliance on time deposits and building core deposits in  we have reduced interest expense  which will contribute to greater net interest income 
during  the percentage of our floating rate commercial loans allowed us to extend the duration of the investment portfolio 
the combination of these two actions should result in higher levels of net interest income in as a natural hedge against lower interest rates  most commercial loans booked over the last two years have contractual interest rate floors  which may mitigate the impact to net interest income  should rates decline 
we also measure  through simulation analysis  the impact to net interest income based on expected balance sheet growth scenarios in addition to rate ramps greater than over and month periods 
when factoring our financial projections growth scenario into the simulation model  we see similar results 
based on our simulation analysis  we believe our net interest income would be fairly comparable  assuming expected changes in balance sheet composition 
due to the assumptions used in preparing our simulation analysis actual outcomes could differ significantly from the simulation outcomes 
economic value at risk we also measure long term interest rate risk through the economic value of equity eve model 
this model involves projecting cash flows from our assets and liabilities over a long time horizon  discounting those cash flows at appropriate interest rates  and then aggregating the discounted cash flows 
our eve is the estimated net present value of these discounted cash flows 
the variance in the economic value of equity is measured as a percentage of the present value of equity 
the sensitivity of eve to changes in the level of interest rates is a measure of the sensitivity of long term earnings to changes in interest rates 
we use the sensitivity of eve principally to measure the exposure of equity to changes in interest rates over a relatively long time horizon 
the following table lists our percentage change in eve in a plus or minus basis point rate shock at december  and the policy guideline is 
due to the low interest rate environment in and  not all interest rates could be shocked basis points 
percentage change in eve change in market interest rates rate shock basis points basis points based on the underlying assumptions used  we were within the policy guideline at year end during  our long term interest rate risk profile was negatively impacted in an immediate interest rate increase of basis points by several factors 
the lengthening of the duration of the investment portfolio caused by the purchase of longer duration mortgage backed securities  particularly cmos  while improving the yield on the portfolio contributed to the increased risk in a basis point rate shock 
the callable fhlb advance portfolio  due to the higher cost as compared to market levels  results in a significantly lower present value of equity 
this lower present value of equity magnifies the variance in eve when rate shocks are applied to the balance sheet 
over time  the impact of the callable fhlb advance portfolio on eve should decline as these advances move closer to their maturity dates 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the previously discussed interest rate risk measurements 
modeling changes in the simulation and eve analysis require the making of certain assumptions  which may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates 
there are many factors that management evaluates when constructing the assumptions used in short term and long term interest rate risk models 
one of the most important assumptions involves deposits without fixed maturity dates 
these include non interest bearing demand  interest bearing demand  savings and money market deposits and represent a significant portion of our deposit base 
we believe these deposits are less sensitive to changes in interest rates than our deposits and assets on our balance sheet 
the balance of these deposits and the rates paid on them may fluctuate due to changes in market interest rates  competition or by the fact that customers may add or withdraw these deposits at any time at no cost 
these characteristics and the lack of a maturity date makes modeling these deposits for both simulation and eve purposes very difficult 
a modest change in the maturity term or repricing characteristics can result in very different outcomes 
since each financial institution assigns different repricing and maturity terms to these non maturity deposits  comparing risk between institutions without understanding the treatment of non maturity deposits has limited value 
another source of uncertainty reflects the options embedded in many of our financial instruments  which included loans  investments and callable fhlb advances 
to deal with the many uncertainties when constructing either short or long term interest rate risk measurements  management has developed a number of assumptions 
depending on the product or behavior in question  each assumption will reflect some combination of market data  research analysis and business judgment 
assumptions are reviewed periodically with changes made when deemed appropriate 
accordingly  although these models provide an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time  such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on ynb s net interest income or economic value of equity and may differ materially from actual results 
we believe that more likely scenarios include gradual changes in interest rate levels 
we continue to monitor our gap position and rate shock analyses to detect changes to our exposure to fluctuating interest rates 
we have the ability to shorten or lengthen maturities on assets  sell securities  enter into derivative financial instruments  or seek funding sources with different repricing characteristics in order to change our asset and liability structure for the purpose of mitigating the effect of interest rate risk changes 

table of contents liquidity risk the objective of liquidity management is to meet the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers  as well as the operating cash needs of ynb at the lowest possible cost 
liquidity risk arises from the possibility we may not be able to satisfy current or future financial commitments as well as the risk of not being able to meet unexpected cash needs or unexpected deposit outflows 
alco is responsible for liquidity risk management 
this committee recommends liquidity policy limits that are approved by the board of directors and receives detailed monthly reports on our liquidity position  including compliance with limits and guidelines 
it includes a review of forecast liquidity needs over time frames up to one year and the adequacy of funding sources to meet these needs 
as part of liquidity risk management  we have developed a detailed contingency funding plan 
on a quarterly basis  alco reviews the adequacy of funding in adverse environments due to changes in interest rates  credit markets or other external risks through its contingency funding report 
traditional sources of liquidity include deposit growth  asset prepayments and maturities 
in addition  we have used and expect to continue to use borrowed funds to support and enhance liquidity 
in addition to the execution of our retail strategy in  which has increased core deposits  we utilize a nationwide computer software based service to raise funds through placement of cds to bolster liquidity and fund loan growth 
brokered cd facilities are also available as another source of liquidity 
asset prepayments include proceeds from principal on loans and mortgage backed securities 
mortgage backed securities represented approximately of total securities during and generated substantial cash flows of approximately million which strengthened liquidity 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and mbs are generally a predictable source of funds  deposit flows and securities prepayments are greatly influenced by interest rates and competition 
we are eligible to borrow additional funds from the fhlb subject to its stock and collateral requirements  and individual advance proposals based on fhlb credit standards 
fhlb advances are collateralized by securities as well as residential and commercial mortgage loans 
we also have the ability to borrow at the federal reserve discount window 
we also maintain unsecured federal funds lines totaling million with five correspondent banks for daily funding needs 
at the financial holding company level  we use cash to pay dividends to stockholders and interest due on subordinated debentures 
the principal source of funding for these payments comes from dividends from the bank 
during  we took actions to further strengthen our liquidity profile 
the continued implementation of our retail strategy has increased core deposits and enhanced liquidity 
we hold a diversified portfolio of marketable securities from which funds could be promptly generated 
total unpledged securities were approximately million at december  in addition  mortgage backed securities have provided cash flows to support asset growth in effective liquidity planning and management will be critical in funding loan growth at a reasonable cost to achieve profitability targets in we believe the ongoing execution of our retail strategy  competitive bidding on surrogate s deposits  cash flows from our mortgage backed securities portfolio and the development of additional funding sources will provide the funding to achieve profitability goals in while maintaining a strong liquidity profile 
capital the management of capital in a highly regulated environment requires a balance between earning the highest return for stockholders while maintaining sufficient capital levels for proper risk management  satisfying regulatory requirements  and for future expansion 
our capital management is designed to assure that we are always well capitalized  as defined by regulatory authorities  and have the necessary capital for our expansion plans 
stockholders equity at december  totaled million compared to million at december  the decrease in stockholders equity was primarily due to the market depreciation of securities available for sale 
the decrease in equity of million or resulted from earnings of million  proceeds of  from exercised stock options  proceeds of  from shares issued through our dividend reinvestment plan   from allocated esop shares  and an increase of  associated with the fair market adjustment related to the allocation of shares from the esop  offset by cash dividend payments of million  a negative adjustment to equity of million from the tax adjusted depreciation in market value of securities available for sale  the purchase of shares from our k plan for our esop totaling  and the increase in treasury stock from the purchase of shares of our common stock associated with our previous dividend reinvestment plan 
on december   we completed the sale of million shares of our common stock in an underwritten common stock offering 
the common stock was sold at a price of per share and generated gross proceeds of million 
net proceeds after underwriting and other offering expenses were million  of which million was contributed to the bank to support asset growth 
we have an esop that permits eligible employees to share in our growth through stock ownership 
in may  the esop purchased an additional  shares from our k plan for  the ynb stock fund  a fund offered through our k plan  was discontinued in may the esop financed the stock purchase with a loan from a nonaffiliated financial institution 
the loan is for a term of two years with a maturity date of december  the balance of the new loan will be repaid in equal installments over the remaining term of the 
table of contents loan 
the shares purchased by the esop were used as collateral for the loan 
at december   the original loan used to purchase  shares for million  when the esop was initiated in  had been paid in full 
the balance of unallocated esop shares at december  was  the annual expenses associated with the esop were  in   in and  in these expenses include compensation expense  debt service on the loan and any adjustment required due to changes in the market value of the shares at time of allocation 
the reason for the increase in cost was related to the increase in the market value of our common stock 
at december   we were not in compliance with certain regulatory requirements and nasdaq standards relating to certain benefit plans and our dividend reinvestment plan  which were promptly addressed 
for a discussion of these matters  see notes to consolidated financial statements notes and in june  the stockholders approved a non qualified stock option plan for non employee directors the directors plan 
this plan allows for the granting of  shares of our common stock at an option price no less than the market value of the stock on the date of grant 
options granted under this plan vest immediately and have a term not to exceed ten years 
this plan provides for a grant of  options per year to each non employee director who is a director on the day immediately after each annual meeting of stockholders 
in addition  the plan allows for the granting of stock options to new non employee directors 
at december   there were  shares available for grant under the director plan 
dividends declared on common stock totaled per share or higher for compared to per share for the dividend payout ratio was for  compared to for the increase in the dividend payout ratio was due to lower earnings in and the increase in per share dividends on a greater number of shares 
regulatory capital we are subject to capital guidelines under federal banking regulations 
these banking regulations relate a company s regulatory capital to the risk profile of its total assets and off balance sheet items  and provide the basis for evaluating capital adequacy 
under these guidelines  assets and certain off balance sheet items are assigned to broad risk categories each with applicable weights 
the resulting capital ratios represent capital as a percentage of total risk weighted assets and certain off balance sheet items 
these guidelines require a minimum ratio of total risk based capital to total risk weighted assets total risk based capital of  including tier capital to total risk weighted assets tier risk based of and a tier capital to average total assets tier leverage of at least 
at december   the most recent notification from the appropriate federal regulator categorized the company as well capitalized under the regulatory framework 
under the capital adequacy guidelines  a well capitalized institution must maintain a total risk based capital ratio of at least  a tier risk based capital ratio of at least and a tier leverage ratio of at least 
the following table sets forth our regulatory capital ratios at december   and december  in thousands tier leverage tier risk based total risk based financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin was issued in january fin applies immediately to enterprises that hold a variable interest in variable interest entities created after january  it applies in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june  to enterprises that hold a variable interest in variable interest entities created before february  fin required us to deconsolidate our subsidiary trusts and could affect the tier capital treatment of trust preferred securities under federal banking regulations 
in july  the board of governors of the federal reserve system instructed bank holding companies to continue to include trust preferred securities in their tier capital for regulatory capital purposes until notice is given to the contrary 
there can be no assurance that the federal reserve will continue to allow institutions to include trust preferred securities in tier capital for regulatory capital purposes 
if the company was not allowed to include the million in trust preferred securities issued by subsidiary trusts in tier capital at december   the company would no longer be considered well capitalized but would be considered adequately capitalized 
the bank capital ratios would not be directly affected by the exclusion of trust preferred securities and the bank would still be considered well capitalized 

table of contents subordinated debentures trust preferred securities we obtained a portion of the funds needed to support the growth of the bank through the sale of subordinated debentures subordinated debentures of yardville national bancorp to our subsidiary statutory business trusts trusts 
these trusts exist for the sole purpose of raising funds through the issuance of trust preferred securities trust preferred securities  typically in private placement transactions  and investing the proceeds in the purchase of the subordinated debentures 
the interest rate on the subordinated debentures is identical to the interest rate on the trust preferred securities
