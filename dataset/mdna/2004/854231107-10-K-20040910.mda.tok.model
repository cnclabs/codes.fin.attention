item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview standex international corporation the company is a leading  focused diversified manufacturer 
the company produces a variety of products and services for selected market segments 
the company has five reporting segments food service equipment  air distribution products  engraving group  engineered products and consumer 
each of these segments reacts to different economic trends 
our diversification has helped to reduce the impact that many economic trends might otherwise have had on the company 
the company has a focused diversity strategy  the goals of which include creating a smaller number of larger more profitable operating units to compete effectively 
our strategy includes growing the earnings of our businesses which have demonstrated market leadership  acquiring companies that compliment our existing businesses and pursuing operational and strategic linkages among our businesses 
some of the economic trends that favorably impacted our businesses include new home construction starts and the timing of expansion plans within the food service equipment industry 
in addition  exchange rates have continued to have an overall positive impact on the businesses owned 
steel is a significant raw material used in the air distribution products  engineered products and food service equipment segments 
recent price increases for galvanized steel strip  stainless steel and carbon steel sheet material  copper wire and refrigeration components have required many of the company s businesses to either implement or plan to implement price increases to offset both the current and future expected price increases of these materials  the impact of which is further explained below 
there are several items that affect the comparability of performance information of the company between the periods discussed in this report 
these items include the following in the fourth quarter of we recognized a pre tax impairment charge for assets to be sold of million associated with the global operations of james burn international 
in the third quarter of we announced the consolidation of the rochester  new york engraving business into the richmond  virginia facility and recorded pre tax restructuring charges of million in our engraving segment 
in the second quarter of we acquired all of the outstanding common shares of nor lake  incorporated nor lake 
in the second quarter of we acquired magnetico  inc magnetico  a manufacturer of magnetic components 
in the second quarter of we sold substantially all the assets and transferred certain liabilities of the jarvis caster group 
in the second quarter of we announced the closing of the commercial printing business and recorded pre tax restructuring charges of million which is included in discontinued operations 
in the first quarter of we announced a plan to exit the roll technology engraving business located in germany and recorded pre tax restructuring charges of million which is included in discontinued operations 
in june of we acquired certain assets and liabilities of i r international and all the outstanding shares of dornbusch cia 
industria e com rico ltda 
in we closed and consolidated certain manufacturing facilities which were under utilized  and various properties were sold  resulting in a net pre tax gain of million 
the company monitors a number of key performance indicators including net sales  operating income  capital expenditure  backlog and gross profit margin 
a discussion of these key performance indicators is included within the discussion below 
consolidated results from continuing operations net sales net sales from continuing operations increased million  a increase 
acquisitions added million in sales in while exchange rates favorably impacted sales by million 
after taking these into account  organic sales increased million when compared to with the exception of the consumer segment  all of our segments reported strong sales growth with our food service equipment segment gaining the most year over year 
organic growth is comprised of both increases in volume as well as price increases introduced to offset increased raw material costs 
a further discussion by segment follows 
net sales from continuing operations increased million  a increase from the fiscal sales include an extra month of european sales of million resulting from the company s decision to conform the accounting year of its european operations to the corporate fiscal year ending june foreign exchange rate changes favorably impacted the sales by approximately million 
this remaining increase in net sales was attributable to increases in organic sales in all but the consumer segment 
operating income income from operations increased million  a increase 
in  restructuring costs decreased million year over year 
see notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional detail on restructuring expenses 
in  the company incurred a cost of million associated with the early retirement of two former key executives 
after factoring these decreases in expenses  the remaining increase in operating income of million is attributable primarily to improved performances within the food service equipment segment  the consumer segment and the engraving segment offset by increased corporate expenses 
see further discussions below by segment 
income from operations decreased million in  a decline from in  the company incurred costs of million associated with the restructuring and realignment program 
in addition  the company incurred a cost of million associated with the early retirement of two former key executives 
excluding these costs  income from operations decreased million 
positive performances in food service equipment  engraving and engineered products segments were offset by the decreases in consumer  air distribution products and increased corporate expenses in capital expenditure in general  the company s capital expenditure over the long term will be equivalent to our annual depreciation costs 
capital expenditure for were million  well below annual depreciation of million 
the company invested cautiously in capital during the year 
capital expenditure increased million in  a increase over the company is investing in technologies primarily in our food service  air distribution products  engraving and engineered products segments 
the company anticipates spending between million and million in capital expenditure in decreased to million from million 
this decrease was in line with expectations as the restructuring and realignment program was launched 
in  the company implemented a lean manufacturing initiative as well 
these events coupled with the sales performance led to an overall decrease in capital expenditure 
backlog overall backlog for one year is up for the current year 
this increase is primarily noted within the food service equipment  engineered products and engraving segments 
with strong order activity and the benefits of acquisitions during the current year  these segments all reported stronger backlog numbers 
gross profit margin the gross margin for was compared to  a slight decrease year over year 
the impact of higher steel and other raw material costs throughout the year were essentially offset by the price increases implemented in the current year 
these price increases had a dilutive effect on gross profit margin 
the change is also attributable to the mix of product sales  with higher sales in air distribution products and food service equipment weighting the overall margin down when compared to the prior year levels 
the gross margin for was  down from in the year over year decline is primarily due to the substitution of lower margin sales in the food service equipment and engineered products segment for higher margin sales in the consumer group 
other items in october  we announced a restructuring and realignment plan in the amount of to million to be incurred over eighteen to twenty four months 
we designed the plan to improve the company s operating performance 
the plan involves disposal or closing of certain under performing operating plants  product lines  manufacturing processes and businesses  realignment and consolidation of certain marketing and distribution activities  and other cost containment actions  including selective personnel reductions 
we estimate that these actions will yield annual cost savings of million once fully implemented 
see notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information relating to the restructuring and realignment plan 
in  the company sold certain properties resulting in net pre tax gain of  in the second quarter of  the chief executive officer and the executive vice president operations elected early retirement 
the charges related to these retirements include costs that previously were being amortized to an anticipated retirement age of  the net present value of the conversion feature of life insurance policies  and a retirement bonus 
the majority of these benefits will be paid over the next ten years  and  accordingly  the total benefits have been discounted their present value of million  which is included in the caption other operating expenses  net in the statements of consolidated income 
income taxes the effective income tax rate from continuing operations for was  essentially unchanged from the prior year rate of 
included in the rate was a settlement  net of related fees  of  associated with a multi year research and development credit which was settled in the fourth quarter of excluding this additional credit  the rate from continuing operations would have been approximately 
the effective income tax rate from continuing operations for was  a slight decline from the rate of 
in  a credit of  associated with research and development activities was recorded while there was no credit taken in excluding this credit  the rate for would have been approximately compared to the in the rate was impacted by the implementation of tax planning strategies  transactional based benefits from distributions from foreign subsidiaries and decreased levels of various tax contingencies which resulted in one time benefits 
segment analysis net sales the following table presents net sales by business segment in thousands food service equipment consumer air distribution products engraving group engineered products food service equipment net sales increased by million in when compared to  a increase 
the acquisition of nor lake in december accounted for million of this increase 
favorable exchange rates between primarily the us dollar  the euro and the british pound resulted in an increase to sales of million 
excluding these impacts  net sales increased million  or 
this increase was fueled by the strong performances of our master bilt products  our useco products and our federal products 
master bilt continues to have great success with their major accounts and benefited from increased equipment orders in the food service segment 
federal capitalized upon its core businesses and expanded its export sales more than three times the prior year level for south america 
the useco business completed several product redesigns in the current year and were awarded a number of new contrac ts with hospital and other institutional customers in the current year 
volume at all of our food service equipment companies are at or near all time highs 
both lean initiatives and active participation in buying groups will be examined and implemented to continue expansion opportunities as well as the continued focus on international market opportunities 
net sales increased million in when compared to  a increase 
of this increase  million is attributable to an extra month of european sales while million was a result of favorable exchange rates 
master bilt s growth was aided by the expansion of distribution with new representatives and the ability to list the products with buying groups 
federal s performance improved year over year with increased market share gains  especially with the quick service restaurants 
procon s pumps continued to outperform competitors while the expansion into reverse osmosis and pesticide applications continued to show progress in new sales 
consumer net sales decreased million in  a change of 
this decrease was consistent with the company s efforts to focus these businesses on improving profitability 
sales within berean and standex direct have both shown recent improvements 
current year developments including several notable christian themed books and movies have aided berean in performing better in the second half of the year  with sales increases of in the most recent quarter 
standex direct continues to focus its marketing efforts to yield better returns  resulting in an increase in sales of in the fourth quarter 
with the closure of the commercial printing line now complete  standard publishing will now focus on the publishing business and review opportunities to build upon core products while expanding sales channels beyond those used traditionally 
consumer demand will continue to play a significant role in this segment and its future sales opportunities 
recent economic trends associated with consumer spending have been positive and the company is hopeful of the continued strengthening in consumer confidence 
fiscal was a disappointing year for this segment 
a decrease in sales was recorded from fiscal s million 
the results of the mail order business were negatively impacted by weak consumer demand and a shorter christmas holiday season 
in addition  higher marketing expenses were incurred to reach new customers  but did not yield the expected results 
the bookstore and publishing divisions also experienced weak consumer and church customer demand due to low consumer confidence 
additionally  marketing expenses increased in the publishing division due to the launch of a new product 
air distribution products net sales increased by million in  a increase 
sales increased as a result of the continued strong housing market  product price increases and penetration into the do it yourself market during the current year 
national accounts are a more significant market segment  which positions adp to take advantage of its eight manufacturing locations located strategically throughout the continental united states 
recent price increases have been implemented to help offset the rapidly rising steel prices experienced throughout the fiscal year 
the company often gives an advanced notice to customers of the price increases 
some of the sales gains made in the current year represent advance buying by those customers 
net sales increased million  or when compared to this increase was driven by a strong market position as well as the introduction of new plasma arc technology 
this new technology allowed adp to expand in its current market  providing packages to its core customers 
engraving group net sales increased by million in  or 
in june  the company completed the acquisition of i r international and dornbusch cia  a brazilian affiliate 
the effect of this acquisition to the engraving group net sales was an increase of million in favorable exchange rates added million to sale in during the fourth quarter of  the consolidation and closure of our rochester  ny facility into our virginia operations commenced 
the immediate need to focus on that move is expected to have a short term negative effect to sales 
net sales increased million  or over of this increase  million was attributable to favorable exchange rates and was attributable to the extra month of european sales 
the remaining increase was a result of market share gains made during  specifically in the automotive programs with large customers 
engineered products net sales increased by million in  or 
in  the company completed the acquisition of magnetico and its affiliate 
the effect of this acquisition was an increase in sales of million 
favorable exchange rates increased sales by million in  primarily in the us dollar to canadian and british currencies 
after taking these into consideration  organic sales increased million in  or 
this was led by our custom hoists unit  whose year over year sales increased million 
this increase in sales reflected the stronger core market for custom in telescoping lifts for the dump trailer and dump body industry 
this market has been in a recession for the last several years  with showing the first signs of recovery 
custom s lean initiatives have helped improve cycle times  deliveries and improve throughput  positioning custom to take advantage of expected increases in electronics organic sales increased million in the current year 
products including fluid level and other pressure indicators for the automotive industry helped to fuel this increase in net sales 
the increase in net sales in of million included  due to the extra month of european sales noted above  and  was due to the effect of changes in average foreign exchange rates 
the remaining increase of million was attributable to the strong performance of electronics as well as increased sales at spincraft offset by a weaker performance at custom hoists 
electronics led the group with an overall increase of from in net sales 
this increase was especially noted in the united kingdom  whose year over year net sales increased in income from operations the following table presents income from operations by business segment in thousands food service equipment consumer air distribution products engraving group engineered products restructuring other expenses  net corporate food service equipment income from operations our measure of segment performance increased by million in  a increase 
the company consolidated the manufacturing facility of useco into our master bilt facility in this consolidation significantly reduced the overhead and labor rate costs for our useco business 
the increase is also attributable to increased sales noted above and the improved margins obtained in our procon and federal units with the successful implementation of lean manufacturing and better sourcing of materials from alternative sources 
income from operations increased  in from  a improvement 
this increase was consistent with the increase in sales volume noted above 
consumer operating income increased by million in  a increase 
much of this increase is attributable to management s focus on improving profitability 
this was most noticeable with standex direct  whose operating income increased million year over year as a result of decreases in marketing expenses and improvement in operating efficiencies 
to further this improvement  the closure of our commercial printing operation improved standard publishing s profitability 
income from operations decreased million in  a change 
as mentioned  was a disappointing year for the consumer segment 
consumer spending  one of the key indicators for this segment  continued to show lackluster growth due to unknowns in the economy 
further  marketing expenses were higher than expected and yielded much lower returns than previous experience 
a plan was established toward the end of to improve the profitability within this segment 
the results above reflect the outcome of that plan 
air distribution products operating income grew by  in  a increase 
this improvement was driven by the increase in sales volume during the current year of partially offset by higher raw material costs for hot rolled galvanized steel 
this steel is a primary component for adp and the rapid price increases seen throughout the steel industry were offset  when possible  with sales price increases 
alternative sources for steel are always being investigated and the impact that future increases may have is evaluated regularly 
operating income for decreased million  a change 
included very favorable steel prices that directly impacted the performance of this segment 
various lean initiatives have been launched to offset the impact of raw material price fluctuations 
in addition  price competition while expanding into new markets put pressure on adp and its margins 
adp examined the existing manufacturing locations and shut down in one of the plants to eliminate overcapacity 
this facility s production was easily transferred to one of the other eight locations 
engraving group operating income rose by million in  a increase 
this increase is in line with the growth in sales overall for this segment 
restructuring activities within this group will continue into the first quarter of  with the closure of the rochester  ny facility and its consolidation into our virginia operations 
the engraving businesses are labor intensive and thus increased volume does not always yield increased margin improvements 
this segment continually evaluates new technologies to reduce the overhead involved in the manufacturing of their product 
the consolidation of facilities will help to reduce that overhead as well 
operating income in increased million  or when compared to a combination of higher sales and cost reductions led to the improved operating income 
engineered products operating income in decreased million in the current year  or when compared to the prior year 
our custom hoists unit more than doubled its operating income year over year  an increase of million  in connection with its growth in net sales 
this was offset by declines at our spincraft units and our electronics units 
our electronics units are undergoing a shift of production from higher cost locations to lower cost areas 
this shift should yield better operating income results in our spincraft units have been negatively impacted by the cost of raw materials and their ability to pass these increases onto customers 
our spincraft units continue to diversify their portfolio of products into newer markets and new customers 
lean initiatives are progressing and are expected to yield results towards the end of operating income in increased million when compared to  or 
this increase was primarily a result of the cost reductions due to lean manufacturing programs and the higher sales noted above 
corporate expenses in increased million  a increase 
the increase is attributable to increased professional fees incurred associated with the company s sarbanes oxley act compliance readiness  project costs recognized associated with the multi year research and development credit discussed above and higher audit fees totaling million 
in addition to those costs  increased pension expense costs of million and increased compensation costs of million also added to the expenses in the corporate expenses rose from million to million in this increase is due primarily to higher professional fees and a reduction in pension credits 
acquisitions our growth is dependent on not only organic growth within our existing businesses  but also the successful completion of acquisitions that align with the strategic goals of the company 
the ability to initiate these transactions is dependent upon the attraction of the target company and the acquisition multiples that the market is demanding 
acquisitions on december  we acquired all of the outstanding common shares of nor lake in an all cash deal 
the results of nor lake s operations have been included in the consolidated statement of operations since that date 
nor lake is one of the nation s largest suppliers of walk in coolers and freezers to the food service and scientific industries  with annual net sales of million 
we view nor lake as a strategic fit with our food service equipment segment for a number of reasons 
nor lake is a provider to the quick serve restaurant business 
we did not have a large presence in this business  and nor lake filled this void in our food service equipment product offerings 
we also believe that the combination of nor lake with our other food service equipment companies will provide opportunities to capitalize on their respective strengths in systems  technologies and manufacturing expertise  and that this combination will create natural synergies in our distribution and service network 
in december  substantially all of the assets of magnetico and its affiliate  trans american transformer  inc  were purchased in an all cash transaction 
the affiliated companies  with combined estimated annual sales of million  custom design and manufacture high reliability  flight critical magnetic components for us military and the aerospace and avionics industries 
this business unit is part of standex electronics in the engineered products segment 
the total purchase price for the two acquisitions was million and resulted in the recognition of million in goodwill 
acquisitions in june  the company completed the acquisition of certain assets and the assumption of certain liabilities of i r international  inc and substantially all of the outstanding stock of dornbusch cia  a brazilian affiliate for a total purchase price of million in cash and unregistered stock 
the aggregate number of shares of common stock comprising the stock portion of the purchase price was  based on an average market price for the stock of per share 
ir manufactures  distributes and sells industrial  gravure and embossing rolls and plates  laser and gravure engraving  texturing and coating services from facilities in virginia and brazil 
i r is highly complimentary to our existing engraving businesses 
the acquisition increased our current market penetration and will further our ability to reach new markets such as south america 
in addition to the acquisition of ir  standex acquired dornbusch cia dornbusch located in sao paolo  brazil 
ir and dornbusch will be fully integrated with standex engraving 
the purchase price was allocated to the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and resulted in the recognition of goodwill of approximately million 
in september  we purchased substantially all of the assets of cincinnati  ohio based cin tran  inc  a manufacturer of custom ul csa approved low frequency transformers 
in december  the company acquired millennium molds  a repairer of injection molds 
the combined purchase price of these acquisitions was million 
both were treated as purchases 
discontinued operations in june  the company s board of directors approved a plan to divest the james burn international jbi global operations 
the company is planning to sell the entirety of jbi business to one buyer in an all cash transaction 
in connection with this authorization  the company recorded a pre tax impairment charge for the assets to be sold of approximately million  including estimated costs to sell 
the assets associated with jbi have been included in other assets as assets held for sale 
jbi recorded annual sales of million in fiscal jbi specializes in wire binding supplies and equipment and has operations located primarily in the united states  mexico  united kingdom  france and singapore 
the wire binding market is experiencing great overcapacity and jbi s business has continued to decline over the last several years 
the company expects to complete this divestiture wi thin the next six months 
the operations of jbi have been included in discontinued operations for all periods presented 
as part of the realignment plan announced in october  the company sold its jarvis caster group previously included in the engineered products segment in november the caster market in the united states has been impacted by the influx of product from asia pacific and from excess global capacity 
these market conditions and the company s assessment of the jarvis caster group s sales and earnings growth potential  led the company to divest itself of the jarvis caster group 
the jarvis group recorded sales of million in the fiscal year ended june  the results of operations of the group  together with a first quarter reported gain from the sale of real estate  have been reclassified to discontinued operations 
also reclassified was an impairment charge  related to the jarvis caster group  of million recorded in the first quarter of the sale of the jarvis caster group did not have a material impact to net income 
during the second quarter  the company finalized its decision to close its printing operation included in the consumer segment and cease its commercial printing business 
in recent years  the printing industry has been undergoing a massive consolidation along with weak demand  overcapacity and rising costs 
the company believes that it can achieve a financial savings by outsourcing its printing needs 
this business unit had net sales of million in fiscal the company completed the closure of this operation at the end of march the company recorded a pre tax charge of million in the second quarter of fiscal as a result of the closure 
in october  the company announced it was exiting the german business for roll technology engraving products which had net sales of million in fiscal the operation  which was part of the engraving segment  had not been profitable for the past several years largely because the business lacked the scale to compete effectively with its two largest competitors in the european market  both of which are headquartered in germany 
as a result of the decision to close the business  a pretax charge of million was included in discontinued operations in the statements of consolidated income 
during  we exited our hf coors china company food service equipment and national metals industries engineered products businesses 
these actions were also taken as part of our realignment plan as we concluded that the two businesses either had limited growth prospects or that these businesses were not suited for long term strategic growth under our ownership 
the real property of hf coors china company and the business were sold in separate transactions while national metal industries was closed 
discontinued operations include the results of operations of these businesses and the gain realized on the sale of the hf coors china company property  net of our exit cost 
liquidity and capital resources cash flow our primary source of liquidity is cash flows from continuing operating activities and our revolving credit facility with eight banks 
in  continuing operations generated million compared to million last year in cash flow 
the decrease year over year came as a result of the large net working capital gains made in the prior year of million while the current year change was less than  from continuing operations 
net working capital is defined as accounts receivable plus inventories less accounts payable 
current year net working capital from continuing operations remained fairly flat with the beginning of the year levels as higher working capital needs were required to support the increased sales volume in cash flows from continuing operations were also impacted by approximately million in pension contributions made in the current year over the prior year contribution levels 
the remaining changes are attributable primarily to increased other receivables of million associated with recent tax claims and increased other notes receivable 
in addition  the sale of certain real estate generated million of incremental cash during the year while discontinued operations used million in cash during the year 
we redeployed those resources by investing million in cash to expand several core businesses by making two acquisitions and by investing million in capital expenditures 
the disposition of discontinued operations resulted in cash proceeds of million 
in addition  we returned million to shareholders through cash dividends million and share repurchases million 
we believe that cash flows from continuing operating activities in fiscal will be sufficient to cover capital expenditures  restructuring activities  operating lease payments  pension contributions  mandatory debt payments and dividends 
we expect to spend between million and million on capital expenditures in fiscal in addition  we regularly evaluate acquisition opportunities 
any cash needed for future acquisition opportunities would be obtained through a combination of any remaining cash flows from continuing operations and borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
in addition to cash flows from continuing operating activities  we have available borrowing capacity under various agreements of up to million as of june  capital structure during  we entered into a new million unsecured revolving credit facility with eight banks  of which million was unused and million was available at june  proceeds may be used for general corporate purposes or to provide financing for acquisition activity 
available borrowings under the revolving credit facility are reduced by unsecured short term borrowings 
in addition  at june   we have two money market credit facilities with banks 
the agreements provide for a maximum unsecured credit line of million 
there were no outstanding balances as of june  on any of these agreements 
in  we entered into a note purchase agreement with two institutional investors for million 
the following table sets forth the company s capitalization at june year ended june in thousands short term debt long term debt total debt less cash total net debt stockholders equity total capitalization stockholders equity increased year over year primarily as a result of the changes in the additional pension liability net of tax benefit of million plus favorable foreign currency movements of million 
the remaining changes are attributable to the treasury stock activity offset by the additional paid in capital increases associated with stock option exercises in the current year 
short and long term net debt decreased by million to million at june  even with the above  the company s net debt to capital percentage improved to from in historically low interest rates  prior years of negative performance of the equity markets  and changes in actuarial assumptions including mortality rates caused standex to suffer higher pension liabilities and lower pension assets 
these assumptions are more fully described in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
as a result  the company recorded a million after tax equity charge in the fourth quarter of to reflect the additional minimum liability under these plans 
current year investment performance coupled with contributions reduced the after tax equity charge to million in the after tax equity charge and the change year to year did not impact cash or earnings and could reverse in future periods should either interest rates increase and or market performance and plan returns continue to improve 
pension expenses are expected to increase by approximately between  to million in as a result of the funded status of the pension plans and changes in actuarial assumptions 
cash contribution requirements in are expected to be approximately million 
the company has an insurance program for certain retired key executives 
the underlying policies have a cash surrender value of million and are reported net of loans of million for which the company has the legal right of offset 
these policies have been purchased to fund supplemental retirement income benefits for certain retired executives 
the aggregate present value of future obligations was  and  at june  and  respectively 
the company is contractually obligated under various operating leases for real property 
the company sponsors a number of both defined benefit plans and defined contribution plans 
we have evaluated the current and long term cash requirements of these plans 
as noted above  the operating cash flows from continuing operations is expected to be sufficient to cover required contributions under erisa and other governing rules 
contractual obligations of the company as of june  are as follows in millions payments due by period less more than than contractual obligations total year years years years long and short term obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term contractual liabilities reflected on the company s balance sheet under gaap total off balance sheet items the company had no other material off balance sheet items at june  other matters inflation certain of the company s expenses  such as wages and benefits  occupancy costs and equipment repair and replacement  are subject to normal inflationary pressures 
foreign currency translation the company s primary functional currencies used by its non us subsidiaries are the euro and the british pound sterling pound 
during the current year  both these currencies have experienced significant increases in value relative to the us dollar  the company s reporting currency 
since june  the euro has appreciated by relative to the us dollar  and the pound has appreciated by relative to the us dollar 
these higher exchange values were used in translating the appropriate non us subsidiaries balance sheets into non us dollars at the end of the current quarter 
environmental matters the company is party to various claims and legal proceedings  generally incidental to its business 
as explained more fully in the notes to consolidated financial statements  we do not expect the ultimate disposition of these matters to have a material adverse effect on our financial statements 
seasonality typically  the second and fourth quarters have been the best quarters for our consolidated financial results 
due to the gift giving holiday season  the consumer segment has experienced strong sales benefiting the second quarter performance 
the fourth quarter performance has been enhanced by increased activity in the construction industry 
employee relations the company maintains a solid working relationship with all of its unions and good employee relations are a focus of management throughout the company 
the company has labor agreements with a number of union locals in the united states and a number of european employees belong to european trade unions 
there were no work stoppages during fiscal year and a total of collective bargaining contracts will expire in fiscal although we believe we have good employee relations  there can be no assurances that work stoppages can be avoided in future periods 
critical accounting policies the condensed consolidated financial statements include accounts of the company and all its subsidiaries 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
although we believe that materially different amounts would not be reported due to the accounting policies described below  the application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
we have listed a number of accounting policies which we believe to be the most critical  but we also believe that all of our accounting policies are important for dis closure purposes 
collectibility of accounts receivable accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
our estimate for the allowance for doubtful accounts related to trade receivables includes evaluation of specific accounts where we have information that the customer may have an inability to meet its financial obligation together with a general provision for unknown but existing doubtful accounts 
actual collection experience may improve or decline 
realizability of inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market and are reduced by a reserve for excess and potentially obsolete inventories 
the company regularly reviews inventory values on hand using specific aging categories  and records a provision for obsolete and excess inventory based on historical usage and estimated future usage 
as actual future demand or market conditions may vary from those projected by management  adjustments to inventory valuations may be required 
realization of goodwill we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangibles effective july  under sfas no 
 goodwill is not amortized  however  goodwill must be tested for impairment at least annually 
therefore  annually in the fourth quarter we test for goodwill impairment by estimating the fair value of our reporting units using the present value of future cash flows method 
in addition  goodwill of a reporting unit is tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit 
an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value 
the nature of the estimates made in projecting future cash flows could adversely affect the calculations made by the company if actual cash flows are less 
we are subject to financial statement risk to the exten t that goodwill becomes impaired 
cost of employee benefit plans we provide a range of benefits to our employees  including pensions and some post retirement benefits 
we record expenses relating to these plans based on calculations specified by us gaap  which are dependent upon various actuarial assumptions such as discount rates  assumed rates of return  compensation increases  turnover rates  and health care cost trends 
the expected return on plan assets assumption is based on our expectation of the long term average rate of return on assets in the pension funds and is reflective of the current and projected asset mix of the funds and considers the historical returns earned on the funds 
the discount rate reflects the current rate at which pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year 
the discount rate is determined by matching our expected benefit payments from a stream of aa or higher bonds available in the marketplace  adjusted to eliminate the effects of call provisions 
we review our actuarial assumptions on at least an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate 
based on information provided by our actuaries and other relevant sources  we believe that our assumptions are reasonable 
the cost of employee benefit plans includes the selection of assumptions noted above 
a one percentage point decrease increase in the expected return on plan assets assumptions  holding our discount rate and other assumptions constant  would increase decrease pension expense by approximately million per year 
a basis point decrease increase in our discount rate  holding all other assumptions constant  would increase decrease pension expense by approximately  see the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding pension plans 
the company has other important accounting policies that at any point may be considered to be material to the company 
the company has described all significant accounting policies within the footnotes to the financial statements and  when such policies are determined to be material  they are included above 
adoption of sfas and new accounting pronouncements none item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management we are exposed to market risks from changes in interest rates  commodity prices and changes in foreign currency exchange 
to reduce these risks  we selectively use  from time to time  financial instruments and other proactive management techniques 
we have internal policies and procedures that place financial instruments under the direction of the treasurer and restrict all derivative transactions to those intended for hedging purposes only 
the use of financial instruments for trading purposes except for certain investments in connection with the keysop plan or speculation is strictly prohibited 
the company has no majority owned subsidiaries that are excluded from the consolidated financial statements 
further  the company has no interests or relationships with any special purpose entities 
exchange risk the company is exposed to both transactional risk and translation risk associated with exchange rates 
regarding transactional risk  the company mitigates certain of its foreign currency exchange rate risk by entering into forward foreign currency contracts from time to time 
these contracts are used as a hedge against anticipated foreign cash flows  such as dividend and loan payments  and are not used for trading or speculative purposes 
the fair value of the forward foreign currency exchange contracts is sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  as an adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates from market rates would decrease the fair value of the contracts 
however  any such losses or gains would generally be offset by corresponding gains and losses  respectively  on the related hedged asset or liability 
due to the absence of forward foreign currency contracts at june   th e company did not have any fair value exposure for financial instruments 
within our foreign operations we are also exposed to transactional risks  specifically with our subsidiaries using the euro and the british pound sterling 
this transactional risk is mitigated  in large part  by natural hedges developed with locally denominated debt service 
a hypothetical appreciation or depreciation of the value of the euro to the us dollar at june  would result in an increase in short term debt of  on our consolidated balance sheet 
our primary translation risk was with the euro and the british pound sterling 
we do not hedge our translation risk 
as a result  fluctuations in currency exchange rates can affect our stockholders equity 
interest rate the company s interest rate exposure is limited primarily to interest rate changes on its variable rate borrowings 
from time to time  the company will use interest rate swap agreements to modify our exposure to interest rate movements 
as of june   a hypothetical immediate increase in interest rates would increase the company s annual interest expense by  the company had an interest rate swap agreement to fix the interest rate on million of its variable rate borrowings 
this agreement expired in may at june  and  the company has no outstanding interest rate swap agreements 
the company also has million of long term debt at fixed interest rates as of june  there would be no immediate impact on the company s interest expense associated with its long term debt due to fluctuations in market interest rates 
however  based on a hypothetical immediate decrease in market interest rates  the fair value of the company s long term debt would be increased by approximately million as of june  such fair value changes may affect the company s determination as to whether to retain  replace or retire its long term debt 
credit risk the company has a diversified customer base 
as such  the risk associated with concentration of credit risk is inherently minimized 
as of june and  no one customer accounted for more than of our consolidated outstanding receivables or of our sales 
in certain segments  some customers represent greater than of the segments revenues 
in our engineered products segment  one customer accounts for of segment annual revenue 
we have a long term supply agreement with this aerospace customer 
although we believe our relationship with this customer is good and will be ongoing  there can be no assurances that this will continue for the entire term of the supply agreement 
in our food service equipment segment  many of our national accounts regularly review their selection of vendors 
although our companies have historically prevailed and even gained market share under these circumstances  the outcome of future reviews can not be predicted 
commodity prices the company is exposed to fluctuating market prices for commodities  primarily steel 
each of our segments is subject to the effects of changing raw material costs caused by the underlying commodity price movements 
in general  we do not enter into purchase contracts that extend beyond one operating cycle 
during the current year  the air distribution products  engineered products and food service equipment segments experienced price increases for steel products and other metal commodities 
among those items impacted were the prices of galvanized steel strip  stainless steel and carbon steel sheet material  copper wire and refrigeration components 
these are key elements in the products manufactured in these segments 
our affected divisions began implementing price increases in the fourth quarter which offset the majority of the increase in steel during the year 
recently  many of our affected segments have become aware of additional future price increases 
wherever possible  the company will implement price increases to offset the increased raw material costs 
while these higher prices are expected to be accepted by our customers there can be no certainty that the price increases implemented will in f act be accepted by our customers 
the ultimate acceptance of these price increases will be impacted by our affected divisions competitors and the timing of their price increases 
the company continually evaluates alternative sources of steel  including increasing the percentage of steel purchased from foreign sources  as alternatives to buying steel from us based mills
