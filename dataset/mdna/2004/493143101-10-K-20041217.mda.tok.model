the foundation laid in fiscal will enable the company to continue its growth strategy in fiscal and beyond 
application of critical accounting policies the company has identified its critical accounting policies  the application of which may materially affect the financial statements  either because of the significance of the financial statement item to which they relate  or because they require management judgment to make estimates and assumptions in measuring  at a specific point in time  events which will be settled in the future 
the critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates  which management believes have the most significant effect on the financial statements are set forth below revenue recognition allowances for doubtful accounts valuation of inventories long lived assets allowances for warranties accounting for income taxes management has discussed the development  selection and related disclosures of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the company s board of directors 
revenue recognition 
the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been provided  the sale price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
additionally  the company sells its goods on terms which transfer title and risk of loss at a specified location  typically shipping point  port of loading or port of discharge  depending on the final destination of the goods 
accordingly  revenue recognition from product sales occurs when all factors are met  including transfer of title and risk of loss  which occurs either upon shipment by the company or upon receipt by customers at the location specified in the terms of sale 
revenue earned from services is recognized ratably over the contractual period or as the services are performed 
if any contract provides for both equipment and services multi ple deliverables  the sales price is allocated to the various elements based on objective evidence of fair value 
each element is then evaluated for revenue recognition based on the previously described criteria 
the company s sales arrangements provide for no other  or insignificant  post shipment obligations 
if all conditions of revenue recognition are not met  the company defers revenue recognition 
in the event of revenue deferral  the sale value is not recorded as revenue to the company  accounts receivable are reduced by any amounts owed by the customer  and the cost of the goods or services deferred is carried in inventory 
in addition  the company periodically evaluates whether an allowance for sales returns is necessary 
historically  the company has experienced little  if any  sales returns 
if the company believes there are potential sales returns  the company would provide any necessary provision against sales 
the company believes that revenue recognition is a critical accounting es timate because the company s terms of sale vary significantly  and management exercises judgment in determining whether to recognize or defer revenue based on those terms 
such judgments may materially affect net sales for any period 
management exercises judgment within the parameters of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap in determining when contractual obligations are met  title and risk of loss are transferred  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
at september   the company had deferred million of revenue compared to million deferred at september  allowances for doubtful accounts 
the company establishes allowances for doubtful accounts for specifically identified  as well as anticipated  doubtful accounts based on credit profiles of customers  current economic trends  contractual terms and conditions  and customers historical payment patterns 
factors that affect collectibility of receivables include customer satisfaction and general economic or political factors in certain countries that affect the ability of customers to meet current obligations 
the company actively manages its credit risk by utilizing an independent credit rating and reporting service  by requiring certain percentages of down payments  and by requiring secured forms of payment for customers with uncertain credit profiles or located in certain countries 
forms of secured payment could include irrevocable letters of credit  bank guarantees  third party le asing arrangements or ex im bank guarantees  each utilizing uniform commercial code filings  or the like  with governmental entities where possible 
the company believes that the accounting estimate related to allowances for doubtful accounts is a critical accounting estimate because it requires management judgment in making assumptions relative to customer or general economic factors that are outside the company s control 
as of september   the balance sheet included allowances for doubtful accounts of  actual charges to the allowance for doubtful accounts for fiscal and were  and  respectively 
accruals for bad debt expense increases in the allowance for fiscal and were  and  respectively 
if the company experiences actual bad debt expense in excess of estimates  or if estimates are adversely adjusted in future periods  the carrying value of accounts receivable would decrease and charges for bad debts would increase  r esulting in decreased net earnings 
deterioration in receivables could also adversely affect the borrowing base available under the company s credit facilities 
valuation of inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
the company s inventory includes purchased raw materials  manufactured components  purchased components  work in process  finished goods and demonstration equipment 
provisions for excess and obsolete inventories are made after periodic evaluation of historical sales  current economic trends  forecasted sales  estimated product lifecycles and estimated inventory levels 
the factors that contribute to inventory valuation risks are the company s purchasing practices  electronic component obsolescence  accuracy of sales and production forecasts  introduction of new products  product lifecycles and the associated product support 
the company actively manages its exposure to inventory valuation risks by maintaining low safety stocks and minimum purchase lots  utilizing just in time purchasing practices  managing product end of life issues brought on by aging components or new product introductions  and by utilizing inventory minimization strategies such as vendor managed inventories 
the company believes that the accounting estimate related to valuation of inventories is a critical accounting estimate because it is susceptible to changes from period to period due to the requirement for management to make estimates relative to each of the underlying factors ranging from purchasing to sales to production to after sale support 
at september   cumulative inventory adjustments to lower of cost or market totaled million compared to million as of september  if actual demand  market conditions or product lifecycles are adversely different from those estimated by management  inventory adjustments to lower market values would result in a reduction to the carrying value of inventory  an increase in inventory write offs  a decrease to gross margins  and could adversely affect the borrowing base available under the company s credit facilities 
long lived assets 
the company regularly reviews all of its long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment  investments in joint ventures  and amortizable intangible assets  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
if the total of projected future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of these assets  an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets  is recorded 
in addition  goodwill is reviewed based on its fair value at least annually 
as of september   the company held million of property  plant and equipment  investments in joint ventures  goodwill and other intangible assets  net of depreciation and amortization 
there were no changes in the company s long lived assets that would result in an adjustment of the ca rrying value for these assets 
estimates of future cash flows arising from the utilization of these long lived assets and estimated useful lives associated with the assets are critical to the assessment of fair values 
the company believes that the accounting estimate related to long lived assets is a critical accounting estimate because it is susceptible to change from period to period due to the requirement for management to make assumptions about future sales and cost of sales generated throughout the lives of several product lines over extended periods of time  and the potential effect that recognizing an impairment could have on the assets reported on the company s balance sheet and the potential material adverse effect on reported earnings or loss 
changes in these estimates could result in a determination of asset impairment  which would result in a reduction to the carrying value and a reduction to net earnings in the affected period  and may affect the company s ability to meet the tangible net worth covenant of its credit facilities 
allowances for warranties 
the company s products are covered by warranty plans that extend between days and years  depending upon the product and contractual terms of sale 
the company establishes allowances for warranties for specifically identified  as well as anticipated  warranty claims based on contractual terms  product conditions and actual warranty experience by product line 
company products include both manufactured and purchased components  and therefore  warranty plans include third party sourced parts which may not be covered by the third party manufacturer s warranty 
ultimately  the warranty experience of the company is directly attributable to the quality of its products 
the company actively manages its quality program by using a structured product introduction plan  process monitoring techniques utilizing statistical process controls  vendor quality metr ics  a quality training curriculum for every employee and feedback loops to communicate warranty claims to designers and engineers for remediation in future production 
warranty expense has varied widely in the past due to such factors as significant new product introductions containing defects and design errors on individual projects 
the company believes that the accounting estimate related to allowances for warranties is a critical accounting estimate because it is susceptible to significant fluctuation period to period due to the requirement for management to make assumptions about future warranty claims relative to potential unknown issues arising in both existing and new products  which assumptions are derived from historical trends of known or resolved issues  and risks associated with third party supplied components being manufactured using processes that the company does not control 
as of september   the balance sheet included warranty reserves of  while m illion of warranty charges were incurred during the fiscal year then ended  compared to warranty reserves of  as of september  and warranty charges of million for the fiscal year then ended 
if the company s actual warranty costs are higher than estimates  warranty plan coverages are adversely varied  or estimates are adversely adjusted in future periods  reserves for warranty would decrease  warranty expense would increase and gross margins would decrease 
accounting for income taxes 
the company s provision for income taxes and the determination of the resulting deferred tax assets and liabilities involves a significant amount of management judgment 
the quarterly provision for income taxes is based partially upon estimates of pre tax financial accounting income for the full year and is affected by various differences between financial accounting income and taxable income 
judgment is also applied in determining whether the deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part 
in management s judgment  when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of specific deferred tax assets such as foreign tax credit carryovers will not be realized  a valuation allowance must be established for the amount of the deferred tax assets that are determined not to be realizable 
there was no valuation allowance at september  due to anticipated utilization of all the deferred tax assets as the company believes it will have sufficient net income combined with the lengthy expiration periods on carryforward items to utilize these assets 
the company maintains reserves for estimated tax exposures in jurisdictions of operation 
these tax jurisdictions include federal  state and various international tax jurisdictions 
potential income tax exposures include potential challenges of various tax credits  export related tax benefits  and issues specific to state and local tax jurisdictions 
exposures are typically settled primarily through audits within these tax jurisdictions  but can also be affected by changes in applicable tax law or other factors  which could cause management of the company to believe a revision of past estimates is appropriate 
during fiscal   and  there have been no significant changes in these estimates 
management believes that an appropriate liability has been established for estimated exposures  however  actual results may differ materially from these estimates 
during the fiscal year ended september   income tax expense was reduced by approximately  due to revisions in estimated permanent tax differences versus actual results in prior year s federal and state tax returns 
during the fiscal year ended september   income tax expense was reduced by approximately  due primarily to changes in tax laws which re characterized previously non deductible items 
the company believes that the accounting estimate related to income taxes is a critical accounting estimate because it relies on significant management judgment in making assumptions relative to temporary and permanent timing differences of tax effects  estimates of future earnings  prospective application of changing tax laws in multiple jurisdictions  and the resulting ability to utilize tax assets at those future dates 
if the company s operating results were to fall short of expectations  there by affecting the likelihood of realizing the deferred tax assets  judgment would have to be applied to determine the amount of the valuation allowance required to be included in the financial statements established in any given period 
establishing or increasing a valuation allowance would reduce the carrying value of the deferred tax asset  increase tax expense and reduce net earnings 
in october  the tax creation act of was enacted 
the company believes this legislation will not impact its ability to utilize its deferred tax assets 
in addition  this legislation phases out the extra territorial income exclusion eti beginning january  through december  the eti exclusion reduced the company s effective tax rate by in the most current fiscal year 
the legislation also provides for a new deduction for manufacturing income  which phases in beginning in the company s fiscal year through although regulations have not been written for the new manufacturing income deduction  the company anticipates that this deduction will largely  if not completely  offset the loss of the eti exclusion 
however  the effects in individual fiscal years during the phase in periods may vary and increase the company s effective tax rate during these periods 
the company does not believe that other provisions of the new legislation will have a material effect on the company s taxes 
results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal net sales decreased to million in fiscal  down million from million in fiscal sales declined in the company s automated inspection systems product line  primarily in the tobacco sorter product line 
contributors to the decline were local competition in china and a strategy change by one of our customers to push product inspection down to its local suppliers 
partially offsetting the decline in tobacco sorters was increased sales in the combined optyx prism lines 
net sales in the company s process systems product line declined in fiscal with reductions appearing in its vibratory lines both in the us and in europe 
sales of parts and service grew on a year over year basis due to increased demand for upgrades and a growth in parts sales 
service sales also showed an improvement year over year of 
gross profit decreased million to million in fiscal from million in gross profit as a percent of sales  however  improved from in to in the dollar decrease is attributable to the volume drop in process systems which also had a slight decrease in gross profit as a percent of sales 
the company s automated inspection systems  while reflecting an overall volume drop from fiscal  delivered improved gross profit margin percentages  particularly in the tegra and optyx product lines 
tobacco sorters  though lower in sales volume  also delivered good gross profit margins 
partially offsetting the volume drop in process systems and automated inspection systems  aftermarket parts and service sales showed volume improvement with resulting gross profit contribution 
also affecting gross profit for fiscal was a price increase in stainless steel  wh ich is used in many of the company s product lines 
although protected somewhat by supply contracts  the higher stainless steel prices resulted in higher component costs and reduced margins on certain product lines by approximately million 
operating expenses increased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  and represented and of net sales in each year  respectively

net earnings from continuing operations for fiscal was million  or per diluted share  compared to million  or per diluted share  for fiscal the principal reasons for the reduced net earnings of fiscal compared to fiscal were lower business volume and increased operating expenses as described above

fiscal compared to fiscal net sales increased to million in fiscal  up million from million in fiscal sales growth occurred over all three of the company s major product lines 
the company handled two large projects totaling million in fiscal that added to both automated inspection system and process system sales 
automated inspection systems sales were higher than in the previous year with increases in the tegra  optyx  and tobacco sorter product lines 
process systems sales grew by in year over year comparison helped by vibratory product line growth as well as strong growth in the company s netherlands subsidiary 
parts sales grew by over fiscal partly due to price increases but also due to orders for tobacco sorter upgrades and a greater emphasis on after sale customer support 
gross profit increased million to million  or of net sales  in fiscal from million  or of net sales  in the gross profit  as a percentage of net sales in fiscal as compared to fiscal  improved due to the growth in higher margin parts sales  favorable manufacturing efficiencies due to volume  and cost reductions  primarily in warranty expenses 
warranty expenses in fiscal included non recurring costs related to two large european projects and to the launch of the optyx product line 
additionally  the company s netherlands subsidiary showed significant improvements in manufacturing efficiencies and cost reductions

cash flow from operating activities was derived from net earnings before non cash expenses  such as depreciation and amortization  of million 
these cash flows were offset by increases in non cash working capital of million 
these increases were primarily due to a reduction of million in customer deposits caused by a reduced customer order backlog at september  versus september  working capital also increased as a result of a reduction of million in accrued payroll liabilities primarily from the payment of profit sharing and other employee incentive plans which were accrued as of the end of fiscal and paid in fiscal these increases in working capital were partially offset by reductions of inventory of million due primarily to inventory management activity that r eflected the reduced backlog at september  compared to the prior year end

 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted material spoilage 
this statement is effective october  the company is currently assessing  but has not yet determined the effect of sfas no 
on its financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company has assessed its exposure to market risks for its financial instruments and has determined that its exposures to such risks are generally limited to those affected by the value of the us dollar compared to the euro and to a lesser extent the australian dollar 
the terms of sales to european customers are typically denominated in either euros or us dollars 
the terms of sales to customers in australia are typically denominated in their local currency 
the company expects that its standard terms of sale to international customers  other than those in europe and australia  will continue to be denominated in us dollars 
for sales transactions between international customers  including european customers  and the company s domestic operations  which are denominated in currencies other than us dollars  the company assesses its currency exchange risk and may enter into forward contracts to minimize such risk 
at september   the company was not a party to any currency hedging transaction 
as of september   management estimates that a change in foreign exchange rates would affect net earnings before taxes by approximately  on an annual basis as a result of converted cash  accounts receivable and sales or other contracts denominated in foreign currencies 
during the company s fiscal  the euro gained a net of in value  ranging between a and gain for the period  against the us dollar 
the effect of the weaker dollar on the operations and financial results of the company were translation adjustments of  net of income tax  were recognized as a component of comprehensive income in the company s consolidated statement of shareholders equity as a result of converting the euro denominated balance sheet of key technology bv into bv dollars  and to a lesser extent  the australian dollar balance sheet of key technology australia pty 
ltd 
foreign exchange gains of  were recognized in the other income and expense section of the consolidated statement of operations as a result of conversion of euro and other foreign currency denominated receivables and cash carried on the balance sheet of the us operations  as well as the result of the conversion of other non functional currency receivables  payables and cash carried on the balance sheet of the european operations 
a relatively weaker us dollar on the world markets makes the company s us manufactured goods relatively less expensive to international customers when denominated in us dollars or potentially more profitable to the company when denominated in a foreign currency 
a relatively weaker us dollar on the world markets  especially as measured against the euro  may favorably affect the company s market and economic outlook for international sales 
under the company s current credit facilities  the company may borrow at the lender s prime rate plus between and basis points 
at september   the company had million of borrowings which had variable interest rates 
during the year then ended  interest on its various credit facilities varied from to 
at september   the rate was on its domestic credit facility and on its european credit facility 
as of september   management estimates that a basis point change in the interest rates would affect net income before taxes by approximately  on an annual basis
