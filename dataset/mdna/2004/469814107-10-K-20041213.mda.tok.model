significant customers for the fiscal years ended september      and  revenues earned directly or indirectly from agencies of the united states federal government accounted for     and respectively  of total revenues 
financial information about geographic areas for financial information regarding geographic areas in which we operate  please refer to note to the consolidated financial statements listed in item  below 
contracts while there is considerable variation in the pricing provisions of the contracts we undertake  our contracts generally fall into three broad categories cost reimbursable  fixed price  and guaranteed maximum price 
the following table sets forth the percentages of total revenues represented by these types of contracts during each of the five preceding fiscal years ended september cost reimbursable fixed price guaranteed maximum price page 
table of contents in accordance with industry practice  most of our contracts are subject to termination at the discretion of the client 
contracts typically provide for reimbursement of costs incurred and payment of fees earned through the date of termination 
when we are directly responsible for engineering  design  procurement  and construction of a project or the maintenance of a client s plant or facility  we reflect the costs of materials  equipment  and subcontracts in both revenues and costs 
on other projects  where the client elects to pay for such items directly  and we have no associated responsibility for such items  these amounts are not reflected in either revenues or costs 
the following table presents the approximate amount of such pass through costs included in revenues for each of the five preceding fiscal years ended september in millions cost reimbursable contracts cost reimbursable contracts generally provide for reimbursement of costs incurred plus an amount of profit 
the profit element may be in the form of a simple mark up applied to the labor costs incurred or it may be in the form of a fee  or a combination of a mark up and a fee 
the fee element can also take several forms 
the fee may be a fixed amount as specified in the contract  it may be an amount based on a percentage of the costs incurred  or it may be an incentive fee based on targets  milestones  or performance factors defined in the contract 
in general  we prefer cost reimbursable contracts because we believe the primary reason for awarding a contract to us should be our technical expertise and professional qualifications rather than price 
fixed price contracts fixed price contracts include both negotiated fixed price contracts and lump sum bid contracts 
under a negotiated fixed price contract  we are selected as the contractor first and then we negotiate a price with our client 
negotiated fixed price contracts frequently exist in single responsibility arrangements where we perform some portion of the work before negotiating the total price of the project 
under lump sum bid contracts  we are required to bid against other contractors based on specifications the client furnishes 
this type of pricing presents certain inherent risks that are reduced by the negotiation process  including the possibility of ambiguities in the specifications received  problems with new technologies  and economic and other changes that may occur over the contract period 
thus  although both types of contracts involve a firm price for the client  the lump sum bid contract provides the greater degree of risk to us 
however  because of economies that may be realized during the contract term  both negotiated fixed price and lump sum bid contracts may offer greater profit potential than the other types of contracts 
over the past five years  most of our fixed price work has been either negotiated fixed price contracts or lump sum bid contracts for project services rather than turn key construction 
guaranteed maximum price contracts guaranteed maximum price contracts are performed in the same manner as cost reimbursable contracts  however  the total actual cost plus the fee cannot exceed the guaranteed price negotiated with the client 
if the total actual cost of the contract exceeds the guaranteed maximum price  then we will bear at least some  if not all  of the excess 
in those cases where the total actual cost and fee are less than the guaranteed price  we will often share the savings on a predetermined basis with the client 
these contracts are not our preferred form of contract because they often contribute to an adversarial relationship with clients  which is contrary to our relationship based business model

table of contents competition we engage in a highly competitive business 
some of our competitors are larger than we are or are subsidiaries of larger companies  and therefore may possess greater resources than we do 
furthermore  because the technical professional aspects of our business do not usually require large amounts of capital  there is relative ease of market entry for a new entrant possessing acceptable professional qualifications 
accordingly  we compete with regional  national  and international firms 
within any specific geographic area  certain competitors  including regional competitors  may possess greater resources than we do 
the extent of our competition varies according to the industries and markets we serve as well as the geographic areas in which we operate 
our largest competitors for engineering  construction  and maintenance services for process plants include the bechtel group  inc  fluor corporation  foster wheeler corp  washington group international  kellogg brown root  aker kvaerner  technip  and amec plc 
in the area of buildings  our competitors include several of the competitors previously mentioned as well as hdr  inc  hellmuth  obata kassabaum  aecom technology  turner construction  and day zimmermann 
in the area of infrastructure  our competitors include several of the competitors previously mentioned as well as parsons brinckerhoff  urs corporation  hntb  and ws atkins 
in the area of pulp and paper  our principal competitors also include be k 
and in the area of federal programs  our principal competitors include several of the companies listed above as well as the shaw group  montgomery watson  saic  chm hill  boeing  northrop grumman  lockheed martin corporation  and computer sciences corporation 
employees at september   we had approximately  full time  staff employees including contract staff 
additionally  as of september   there were approximately  persons employed in the field on a project basis 
the number of field employees varies in relation to the number and size of the maintenance and construction projects in progress at any particular time 
available information we regularly file various reports with the securities and exchange commission sec 
these reports include annual reports on form k and quarterly reports on form q 
we also file from time to time current reports on form k

we maintain sales offices at many of our principal locations 
the majority of our offices and locations are leased 
we also rent a portion of our construction equipment on a short term basis 
item legal proceedings in the normal course of business  we are subject to certain contractual guarantees  litigation and investigations 
generally  such guarantees relate to project schedules and plant performance 
most of the litigation involves us as a defendant in workers compensation  personal injury  environmental  environmental exposure  professional liability  and other similar lawsuits 
in addition  as a contractor for many agencies of the united states government  we are subject to many levels of audits  investigations and claims by  or on behalf of  the government with respect to contract performance  pricing  costs  cost allocations and procurement practices 
management believes  after consultation with counsel  that such guarantees  litigation  united states government contract related audits  investigations and claims should not have any material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in addition to the matters described above  we are involved in a dispute with a client relating to a large waste incineration project in europe 
the contract was entered into by one of our subsidiaries several years ago  prior to the acquisition of that subsidiary 
the dispute involves proper waste feed  content of residues  final acceptance of the plant  and costs of operation and maintenance of the plant 
we have initiated litigation against the client and are seeking in excess of million approximately million in damages 
the client has filed a counterclaim against us  which we believe is without merit 
we believe our claims are valid and enforceable and that we will be ultimately successful in obtaining a favorable judgment

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the purpose of this management s discussion and analysis md a is to provide an overview of the company s financial condition and results of operations as well as an analysis of the factors that caused certain key elements of our financial statements to change from one year to the next 
in this discussion  we may make statements that are not based on historical fact 
all such statements are forward looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of private securities litigation reform act of although such statements are based on management s current estimates and expectations  and currently available competitive  financial  and economic data  forward looking statements are inherently uncertain  and we caution the reader that a variety of factors could cause business conditions and results to differ materially from what is contained in our forward looking statements 
a list of some of the factors most likely to occur that could cause actual results to differ from our forward looking statements is presented at the end of this md a 
in this md a  we use certain terms and abbreviations that are defined as follows apb accounting principles board backlog backlog represents the total dollar amount of revenues we expect to record in the future as a result of performing work under contracts that have been awarded to us 
our policy with respect to o m contracts  however  is to include in backlog the amount of revenues we expect to receive for one succeeding year  regardless of the remaining life of the contract 
for federal programs other than federal o m contracts  our policy is to include in backlog the full contract award  whether funded or unfunded  and exclude option periods

operating profit from the consolidated statements of earnings  operating profit means revenues  less direct costs of contracts and sg a expenses 
sfas statement of financial accounting standards  an accounting standard adopted by the financial accounting standards board fasb 
sg a expenses from the consolidated statements of earnings  sg a expenses means selling  general and administrative expenses 
overview our operating results for fiscal reflected growth in earnings that was below management s expectations 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we had several projects where our work was either suspended or delayed  and one project that was cancelled entirely 
although changes in the timing of when work required by large projects commences is not unusual  the magnitude of the delays and cancellation that occurred during the third quarter of fiscal had a significant impact on our results of operations for both the third and fourth fiscal quarters 
these delays and cancellations contributed to a decline in revenues  and hindered our ability to absorb the increase in our sg a expenses 
also contributing to the decrease in revenues during fiscal as compared to fiscal was a decline in pass through costs 
when we are responsible for subcontract labor or third party materials and equipment  we reflect the costs of such items in both revenues and costs 
since pass through costs which are incurred primarily on projects requiring field services typically do not have page 
table of contents significant margins  we can experience a decline in revenues without experiencing a corresponding decline in our gross margins and operating profit 
the increase in the technical and professional services component of our revenues  relative to pass through costs  was the chief reason for the improved gross margins for fiscal as compared to fiscal gross margins increased by million  or  during fiscal as compared to last year 
however  due to increased g a spending in support of higher home office services  our operating profit percentage remained at of revenues for fiscal  the same percentage as fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we completed the acquisition of the babtie group for a total cash purchase price of million approximately million 
headquartered in scotland  the babtie group is a leading provider of technical and professional services to clients in the infrastructure  facilities  environmental  defense  and governmental outsourcing markets  among others 
although the babtie group employs approximately  people and generates approximately million of revenues annually  the effect of the acquisition on our fiscal results of operations was not material 
because i the entire value of contracts is added to backlog as soon as the contracts are awarded to us rather than adding the contracts to backlog gradually over time  and ii many of our contracts require us to provide services that span over a number of fiscal quarters and sometimes over fiscal years  we evaluate our backlog on a year over year basis  rather than on a sequential  quarter over quarter basis 
our backlog at september  increased by million  or  to billion from billion at september  the increase in backlog during fiscal was attributable primarily to the addition of the babtie group  combined with new awards from clients within the oil gas and refining industries  and the us federal program area of our business 
backlog at september  reflects the project cancellation discussed above 
in addition  approximately million of procurement backlog was removed during the third quarter of fiscal  as well as approximately million of backlog relating to public sector work when it was determined that we would not receive the full value of the contract award 
our cash balances remained strong during fiscal in spite of the cash used to acquire the babtie group and an increase in acquisitions of property and equipment  cash and cash equivalents totaled million at september  compared to million at september  our cash balances  combined with a borrowing capacity of million under our long term  unsecured revolving credit facility  present sufficient capital resources for us to fund our on going operations 
additions to property and equipment totaled million during fiscal this was million  or  higher than the amount spent during fiscal contributing to the increase was certain initiatives to expand office space in several of our larger offices in the united states and united kingdom 
critical accounting policies in order to better understand changes that may occur to key elements of our financial condition and operating results  a reader of this md a should understand the critical accounting policies we apply in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
the consolidated financial statements contained in this report were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  and the financial statements of any business entity performing long term engineering and construction type contracts  requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect both the entity s results of operations as well as the carrying values of its assets and liabilities 
although our significant accounting polices are described in note of the notes to page 
table of contents consolidated financial statements  the following discussion is intended to describe those accounting policies most critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue accounting for contracts and use of joint ventures in accounting for long term engineering and construction type contracts  we follow the provisions of the aicpa s statement of position accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
in general  we recognize revenues at the time we provide services 
depending on the commercial terms of the contract  we recognize revenues either when costs are incurred  or using the percentage of completion method of accounting by relating contract costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion 
this method of revenue recognition requires us to prepare estimates of costs to complete contracts in progress 
in making such estimates  judgments are required to evaluate contingencies such as potential variances in schedule  the cost of materials and labor  and productivity  and the impact of change orders  liability claims  contract disputes  and achievement of contractual performance standards 
many of our engineering and construction contracts provide for reimbursement of costs plus a fixed or percentage fee 
in some of the markets we serve there is an increasing trend towards cost reimbursable contracts with incentive fee arrangements 
in certain instances  we base our incentive fees on achievement of target completion dates  target costs  and or other performance criteria 
failure to meet these targets or increases in contract costs can result in unrealized incentive fees or non recoverable costs  which could exceed revenues recognized from the project 
one such contract is with the us department of energy for the fernald closure project 
this contract provides for incentive fees based on schedule and cost 
in addition  the terms of the contract stipulate that the incentive fees may not be fully billed to the doe until the completion of the project  currently estimated to occur in at september  we had recognized million of deferred fees relating to this contract 
we provide for contract losses in their entirety in the period they become known  without regard to the percentage of completion 
the nature of our business results in clients  subcontractors or vendors occasionally presenting claims against us for recovery of costs they incurred in excess of what they expected to incur  or for which they believe they are not contractually responsible 
similarly  and in the normal course of business  we may present claims to our clients for costs we have incurred for which we believe we are not contractually responsible 
in those situations where a claim against us may result in additional costs to the contract  we would include in the total estimated costs of the contract and therefore  the estimated amount of margin to be earned under the contract an estimate  based on the relevant facts and circumstances available  of the additional costs to be incurred 
in those situations where we have incurred additional costs for which we believe the client is contractually responsible  we may present a claim to the client for such costs 
in such situations  we include in revenues the amount of costs incurred  without profit  to the extent it is probable that the claims will result in additional contract revenue  and the amount of such additional revenue can be reliably estimated 
costs associated with unapproved change orders are included in revenues using substantially the same criteria used for claims 
certain cost reimbursable contracts with government customers as well as certain commercial clients provide that contract costs are subject to audit and adjustment 
in this situation  revenues are recorded at the time services are performed based upon the amounts we expect to realize upon completion of the contracts 
in those situations where an audit indicates that we may have billed a client for costs not allowable under the terms of the contract  we estimate the amount of such nonbillable costs and adjust our revenues accordingly 
as is common in the industry  we execute certain contracts jointly with third parties through various forms of joint ventures 
for certain of these joint ventures ie  where we have an undivided interest in the assets and liabilities of the venture  we recognize our proportionate share of joint venture page 
table of contents revenues  costs and operating profit in our consolidated statements of earnings 
for other investments in engineering and construction joint ventures  we use the equity method of accounting 
accounting for stock issued to employees we account for stock based employee compensation using the intrinsic value method  in accordance with apb opinion no 
accounting for stock issued to employees 
accordingly  on the date a stock option is granted to an employee  we measure compensation cost based on the excess  if any  of the market price of the company s common stock over the exercise price of the awarded option 
in accordance with current accounting standards  we compute a pro forma expense amount for stock options issued  and we disclose this pro forma expense amount in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to compute the pro forma expense amount 
the black scholes model  however  was developed for use in estimating the value of publicly traded options that have no vesting restrictions and which are fully transferable 
in addition  the black scholes model requires the use of assumptions in order to compute the hypothetical  fair value of an option 
changes in these assumptions can cause drastically different values being assigned to a stock option 
accordingly  we caution the readers of our consolidated financial statements that the results of applying the black scholes model are not necessarily a reliable measure of the true fair value of stock options granted to employees 
accounting for pension plans in accounting for pension plans  we follow the provisions of sfas no 
employers accounting for pensions 
sfas requires the use of assumptions and estimates in order to calculate periodic pension cost  and the value of the plans assets and liabilities 
these assumptions involve discount rates  investment returns  and projected salary increases  among others 
we rely on qualified actuaries to assist us in valuing the financial position of the plans  and to provide advice regarding the actuarial assumptions used 
during fiscal  we lowered slightly our expected rate of return on plan assets from a range of to in fiscal to a range of to in fiscal we believe this reduction better reflects the long term returns expected on the plans assets  considering projected rates of inflation  the diversification of the plans assets  and the expected real rates of market returns 
changes in the actuarial assumptions may have a material affect on the plans assets and liabilities  and the associated pension expense 
management  together with our actuaries  monitors trends in the marketplace within which our pension plans operate in order to assure the fairness of the actuarial assumptions used 
in connection with the fiscal acquisition of certain engineering and contracting businesses from stork nv  we are negotiating the value of certain plan assets and prior service obligations that may be transferred from a multiemployer pension plan into a new  single employer pension plan we formed during fiscal for the benefit of our employees in the netherlands 
if such a transfer were to occur presently  we believe the value of the assets we would receive would be less than the value of the prior service pension obligations we would assume 
included in other deferred liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at september  is approximately million for the prior service obligations relating to the multiemployer pension plan in the netherlands 
accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for income taxes 
judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes 
in the normal course of our business  we may engage in numerous transactions every day for which the ultimate tax outcome including the period in which the transaction will ultimately be included in taxable income or deducted as an expense is uncertain 
additionally  we file income  franchise  gross receipts and similar tax returns in many jurisdictions 
our tax returns are subject to audit and investigation by the internal revenue service  most states in the united states  and by various government agencies representing many jurisdictions outside the united states 
although our effective tax rate has been during fiscal  and  we continually monitor the page 
table of contents appropriateness of the rate  and we adjust our income tax expense in the period it is probable that actual results will differ from our estimates 
insurance matters  litigation  claims  and contingencies in the normal course of business  we are subject to certain contractual guarantees and litigation 
generally  such guarantees relate to project schedules and plant performance 
most of the litigation in which we are concerned involves the company as a defendant in workers compensation  personal injury  environmental  environmental exposure  professional liability  and other similar lawsuits 
we maintain insurance coverage for various aspects of our business and operations 
however  we have elected to retain a portion of losses that may occur through the use of various deductibles  limits  and retentions under our insurance programs 
this situation may subject us to some future liability for which we are only partially insured  or completely uninsured 
in addition  as a contractor providing services to various agencies of the united states federal government  we are subject to many levels of audits  investigations  and claims by  or on behalf of  the us federal government with respect to contract performance  pricing  costs  cost allocations  and procurement practices 
in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for contingencies  we record in our consolidated balance sheets amounts representing our estimated liability relating to such claims  guarantees  litigation  and audits and investigations 
we rely on qualified actuaries to assist us in determining the level of reserves to establish for both insurance related claims that are known and have been asserted against us as well as for insurance related claims that are believed to have been incurred based on actuarial analysis  but have not yet been reported to our claims administrators as of the respective balance sheet dates 
we include any adjustments to such insurance reserves in our consolidated results of operations 
testing goodwill for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  the amount of goodwill carried in our consolidated balance sheets is tested annually for possible impairment 
in conducting the impairment test  we may apply  in accordance with the provisions of sfas  various techniques to estimate the fair value of our reporting units 
these techniques are inherently subjective and the resulting values are not necessarily representative of the values we might obtain in a sale of our reporting units to a willing third party 
since the adoption of sfas in fiscal  we have not recorded any impairment loss associated with our goodwill 
operations outside the united states in general  our principal exposure to fluctuating exchange rates relates to the effects of translating the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries  which are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  into the us dollar 
we follow the provisions of sfas no 
foreign currency translation in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
we believe our exposure to the effects that fluctuating foreign currencies may have on our consolidated results of operations is limited because our various operations invoice clients and satisfy their financial obligations primarily in their respective local functional currencies 
in situations where our operations incur contract costs in currencies other than their functional currencies  we strive to have a portion of the related contract revenues denominated in the same currencies as the costs 
results of operations general our business focuses exclusively on providing technical  professional  and construction services to a large number of industrial  commercial  and governmental clients around the world 
the services we provide generally fall into four broad categories project services which includes engineering  design  architectural  and similar services  page 
table of contents construction services which includes revenues earned from traditional field construction activities as well as modular construction activities  operations and maintenance o m services which includes revenues from contracts requiring us to operate and maintain large  complex facilities on behalf of clients as well as contracts involving process plant maintenance services and activities  and process  scientific  and systems consulting services which includes revenues earned from providing a wide variety of scientific and consulting services to clients 
the scope of services we can provide our clients  therefore  ranges from consulting and conceptual design services which are often required by clients in the very early stages of a project to complete  single responsibility  design build operate contracts 
the following table sets forth our revenues by type of service for each year ended september in thousands project services construction operations and maintenance process  scientific and systems consulting beginning with the second quarter of fiscal  we classify certain elements of revenues as construction that were classified previously as project services 
in addition  certain amounts for fiscal and have been reclassified to conform to the fiscal presentation 
we focus our services on certain industry groups and markets that we believe have sufficient common needs to permit cross utilization of our resources 
the following table sets forth our revenues by these industry groups and markets for each year ended september in thousands oil gas and refining federal programs pharmaceuticals and biotechnology chemicals and polymers technology and manufacturing buildings infrastructure pulp and paper other other includes projects for clients operating in a number of industries including food and consumer products  and basic resources such as mining  minerals  and fertilizers 
fiscal compared to fiscal we recorded net earnings of million  or per diluted share  for fiscal year ended september   compared to net earnings of million  or per diluted share for fiscal page 
table of contents total revenues for fiscal remained relatively unchanged from fiscal at billion 
the amount of pass through costs included in revenues in fiscal declined by approximately million  or  as compared to fiscal the level of pass through costs included in revenues and costs will vary between reporting periods depending principally on the amount of procurement that clients choose to do themselves as opposed to using our services as well as on the normal winding down of field services activities on construction and o m projects 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of pass through costs 
off setting this decline in field services activity in part was approximately million of revenues of the babtie group  which we acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal the babtie group is a leading provider of technical and professional services to clients in the infrastructure  facilities  environmental  defense  and governmental outsourcing markets  among others 
as a percentage of revenues  direct costs of contracts were for fiscal compared to for fiscal the percentage relationship between direct costs of contracts and revenues will fluctuate between reporting periods depending on a variety of factors including the mix of business during the reporting periods being compared as well as the level of margins earned from the various types of services provided 
in general  the percentage improvement in this performance indicator from fiscal to was due primarily to a higher portion of our total revenues being derived from technical professional services versus field services 
sg a expenses for fiscal increased by million  or  to million  compared to million for fiscal included in sg a expenses for fiscal is approximately million of sg a expenses from the babtie group 
the balance of the increase was due primarily to the effects of foreign currency translation  and higher spending in support of our professional technical services activities 
operating profit for fiscal totaled million  relatively unchanged from the fiscal amount of million 
as a percentage of revenues  operating profit was for both fiscal and interest income increased by million to million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal the increase in interest income was due primarily to higher cash balances on deposit during fiscal as compared to fiscal interest expense increased by million  or  to million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal the increase in interest expense was due primarily to slightly higher borrowings under our long term  revolving credit facility 
we recorded income tax expense of million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
our overall effective tax rate was for both fiscal years 
in the normal course of our business  we may engage in numerous transactions every day for which the ultimate tax outcome including the period in which the transaction will ultimately be included in taxable income or deducted as an expense is uncertain 
additionally  we file income  franchise  gross receipts and similar tax returns in many jurisdictions 
our tax returns are subject to audit and investigation by the internal revenue service  most states in the united states  and by various government agencies representing many jurisdictions outside the united states 
although our effective tax rate has been for fiscal and  we continually monitor the appropriateness of the rate  and we adjust our income tax expense in the period it is probable that actual results will differ from our estimates

our overall effective tax rate was for both fiscal and contractual obligations the following table sets forth certain information about our contractual obligations as of september  in thousands payments due by fiscal period total less than year years years more than years bank debt operating leases obligations under defined benefit pension plans a obligations under nonqualified deferred compensation plans b purchase obligations c total page 
table of contents a assumes that future contributions will be consistent with amounts projected to be contributed in fiscal  allowing for certain growth based on rates of inflation and salary increases  but limited to the amount recorded as of september  actual contributions will depend on a variety of factors  including amounts required by local laws and regulations  and other funding requirements 
b assumes that future payments will be consistent with amounts paid in fiscal  allowing for certain growth 
due to the nonqualified nature of the plans  and the fact that benefits are based in part on years of service  the payments included in the schedule was limited to the amount recorded as of september  c represents those liabilities estimated to be under firm contractual commitments as of september  backlog the following table summarizes our total backlog at september   and in millions technical professional services total in accordance with industry practice  substantially all of our contracts are subject to cancellation or termination at the option of the client 
however  we have not experienced cancellations that have had a material effect on the reported backlog amounts 
in a situation where a client terminates a contract  we would ordinarily be entitled to receive payment for work performed up to the date of termination and  in certain instances  we may be entitled to allowable termination and cancellation costs 
while management uses all information available to it to determine backlog  our backlog at any given time is subject to changes in the scope of services to be provided as well as increases or decreases in costs relating to the contracts included therein 
in fiscal we began classifying as field services backlog certain engineering and scientific and systems consulting activities relating to operations and maintenance contracts that had been classified previously as technical professional services backlog 
backlog for fiscal years has been reclassified to conform to the fiscal presentation 
total backlog at september  included approximately billion or of total backlog  relating to work to be performed either directly or indirectly for the us federal government and its agencies 
this compares to approximately billion or and billion or of us federal backlog at september  and  respectively 
most of our federal contracts extend beyond one year 
in general  these contracts must be funded annually ie  the amounts to be spent under the contract must be appropriated by the us congress to the procuring agency  and then the agency must allot these sums to the specific contracts 
our backlog for fiscal increased by million  or  to billion  compared to fiscal  and increased in fiscal by million  or  to billion  compared to fiscal the increase in backlog during fiscal as compared to fiscal was attributable primarily to the addition of the babtie group  combined with new awards from clients within the oil gas and refining industries  and the us federal program area of our business 
the increase in fiscal as compared to fiscal was attributable primarily to new awards from clients in the oil gas and refining industries combined with new us federal program awards

table of contents we estimate that approximately billion or of total backlog at september  will be realized as revenues within the next fiscal year 
effects of inflation during fiscal   and  approximately   and  respectively  of our consolidated revenues were realized from cost reimbursable type contracts 
because a significant portion of our revenues continues to be earned under cost reimbursable type contracts  the effects of inflation on our financial condition and results of operations continue to be generally low 
however  as we expand our business into markets and geographic areas where fixed price and lump sum work is more prevalent  inflation may have a larger impact on our results of operations in the future 
to the extent permitted by competition  we intend to continue to emphasize contracts which are either cost reimbursable or negotiated fixed price 
for contracts with fixed price and lump sum terms  we closely monitor the actual costs on the project as compared to the original estimates 
on these projects  we also attempt to secure fixed price commitments from key subcontractors and vendors 
however  due to the competitive nature of our business  combined with the fluctuating demands and prices associated with personnel  equipment and materials we traditionally need in order to perform on our contracts  there can be no guarantee that inflation will not affect our results of operations in the future 
liquidity and capital resources we finance our operations primarily through cash provided by operations 
at september   our principal source of liquidity consisted of million of cash and cash equivalents  and million of available capacity under our million revolving credit facility discussed below 
during fiscal  our cash and cash equivalents decreased by million  to million 
this compares to a net increase in cash and cash equivalents of million  to million  during fiscal  and to a net decrease of million  to million  during fiscal during fiscal  we experienced net cash inflows from operating activities  and financing activities of million and million  respectively 
these inflows were offset by net cash outflows from investing activities and the effect of exchange rate changes of million and million  respectively 
our operations provided net cash of million during fiscal this compares to net cash inflows of million and million during fiscal and  respectively 
the million decrease in cash provided by operations in fiscal as compared to fiscal was due primarily to a decrease of million relating to the timing of cash receipts and payments within our working capital accounts 
also contributing to the decline in cash flows from operations was the effects of a million change in deferred income taxes  and a million increase in gains from the sales of assets the cash flows associated with which are shown in the investing section of the consolidated statements of cash flows 
the net cash we used for investing activities was million during fiscal this compares to net cash outflows of million and million during fiscal and  respectively 
the net increase of million in cash used for investing activities during fiscal as compared to fiscal was due primarily to an increase of million in cash used for acquisitions 
also contributing to the increase in cash used for investing activities was a million increase in additions to property and equipment  a million increase in investments and other non current assets  and a decrease in cash proceeds from the sales of investments 
off setting these increases in part was a million increase in proceeds from sales of property and equipment 
our financing activities resulted in net cash inflows of million during fiscal this compares to net cash outflows of million and million during fiscal and  respectively

table of contents compared to fiscal was due primarily to a million increase in borrowings  net of repayments  under our long term credit facilities  combined with a million reduction during fiscal of cash used to pay off short term indebtedness 
we believe we have adequate liquidity and capital resources to fund our operations and service our debt for the foreseeable future 
we had million in cash and cash equivalents at september   compared to million at september  our consolidated working capital position at september  was million  compared to million at september  we have a long term  unsecured revolving credit facility providing up to million of debt capacity  under which only million was utilized at september  in the form of direct borrowings 
we believe that the capacity  terms and conditions of our long term revolving credit facility is adequate for our working capital and general business requirements  as well as the working capital needs associated with the acquisition of the babtie group 
we also had  at september   million of borrowing capacity available to us through committed  short term credit facilities 
under our stock repurchase program  we are authorized by our board of directors to buy back up to million shares of the common stock of the company in the open market 
repurchases of common stock are financed from existing credit facilities and available cash balances 
from inception of the program through september   we have repurchased a total of  shares of common stock in the open market at a total cost of million 
no shares of common stock were repurchased during fiscal and substantially all shares of common stock held in treasury were eventually reissued for our employee stock purchase and incentive stock plans

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading  speculation or other purposes that would expose the company to market risk 
in the normal course of business  our results of operations are exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates 
interest rate risk our only source for long term credit is a million syndicated revolving credit facility 
the total amount outstanding under this facility at september  was million 
this agreement expires in august of  and provides for both fixed rate and variable rate borrowings 
our objectives in managing our interest rate risk are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows  and to lower our overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  we maintain fixed rate debt on a majority of our borrowings and minimize our outstanding borrowings by paying down debt from cash provided from operations 
foreign currency risk in general  our exposure to fluctuating exchange rates relates to the effects of translating the financial statements of our subsidiaries operating outside the united states  which are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  into the us dollar 
we follow the provisions of sfas no 
foreign currency translation in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
we believe our exposure to the effects that fluctuating foreign currencies may have on our consolidated results of operations is limited because  in general  our various operations invoice customers and satisfy their financial obligations in their respective local currencies 
in situations where our operations incur contract costs in currencies other than their own functional currencies  we strive to have a portion of the related contract revenues denominated in the same currencies as the costs 
in connection with the acquisition of the babtie group  we entered into a forward contract with a large  us bank in the notional amount of million approximately million 
the purpose of the contract was to hedge the company s foreign currency exchange exposure on a million intercompany loan between jacobs and one of its subsidiaries 
regardless of the degree to which the value of british sterling may decline against the us dollar  the maximum potential effect on our future earnings will be limited to million 
the forward contract qualifies as a cash flow hedge under the provisions sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities
