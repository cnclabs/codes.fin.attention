the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements contained herein and the notes thereto  along with the section entitled  critical accounting policies and estimates  set forth below 
overview our company operates primarily in the worldwide billion in vitro diagnostics business 
we develop  manufacture and market oral fluid specimen collection devices using proprietary oral fluid technologies  diagnostic products including immunoassays  and other in vitro diagnostic tests 
we also manufacture and sell a medical device for the removal of warts and other benign skin lesions by cryosurgery  or freezing 
our diagnostic product offerings primarily target the infectious disease and substance abuse testing segments of the larger in vitro diagnostic market  and are used in both laboratories as well as the emerging  and rapidly growing  point of care marketplace 
our orasure and intercept oral fluid collection devices  and their related assays  are processed in a laboratory  while the oraquick rapid hiv antibody test and uplink oral fluid rapid drug detection system are designed for use at the point of care 
our cryosurgical product  which is sold under the names histofreezer and freeze off  is also used at the point of care 
in vitro diagnostics have traditionally used blood or urine as the bodily fluids upon which tests are conducted 
however  we have targeted the use of oral fluid in our products as a differentiating factor  and believe that it provides a significant competitive advantage over blood and urine 
our oral fluid tests have sensitivity and specificity comparable to blood and or urine tests and  when combined with their ease of use  non invasive and dignified nature  and cost effectiveness  represent a very competitive alternative to the more traditional testing methods in the diagnostic space 
we have made significant progress in increasing our sales and gaining market acceptance for our products 
as a result  we reported strong financial results for our total revenues were million  or an increase of over  and our net loss for the year was million  representing an improvement of more than million over additionally  both the third and fourth quarters of were profitable 
our liquidity also improved  as we reported million in cash flow from operations in and we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments as of december  sales into the infectious disease testing market segment increased significantly in due to the market acceptance of our oraquick device 
this increase resulted largely from sales directly to various public health organizations  sales to the centers for disease control and prevention cdc for further distribution in the public health market  and sales to abbott laboratories for distribution primarily to hospitals 
in  the cdc placed purchase orders totaling million for  oraquick devices  with equal amounts to be shipped in and we expect that the cdc  and perhaps other federal governmental agencies  will make future bulk purchases of oraquick devices for further distribution to the public health and other markets throughout the united states 

table of contents in october  we announced the termination of our agreement with abbott for distribution of oraquick 
abbott disputed our termination  and this dispute was recently resolved by an arbitrator who ruled that the agreement was not terminated and will continue in effect 
in addition  consistent with the arbitrator s rulings we recently notified abbott that the agreement was converted from co exclusive to non exclusive 
we also announced our intent to establish an internal sales force for selling oraquick directly into the hospital market 
we have made progress in establishing this sales force with the recent hiring of a new director  hospital sales to lead it 
the success of this effort will impact the future sales of oraquick 
we also intend to address the market potential of physicians offices by engaging one or more distribution partners  as we believe it would be impractical to build and sustain an internal sales force large enough to adequately service that market 
we believe that the combined efforts of our company  abbott and our other distribution partners will help us gain significant market penetration with oraquick in the hospital  physicians office and other markets for rapid hiv testing 
during  two competitors received us food and drug administration fda approval for rapid hiv tests 
based on their current fda approvals  we expect that these tests will be sold  and will compete with our oraquick test  primarily in the hospital market in the united states 
we are still waiting for fda action on three pending pma submissions for oraquick 
if we receive these approvals  as we expect  the additional claims will allow oraquick to be used for detecting antibodies to both hiv and hiv and for testing oral fluid and plasma  in addition to finger stick and venipuncture whole blood samples 
we believe these approvals will give us the most versatile rapid hiv test in the world and provide a significant advantage over our competitors 
sales to the substance abuse testing market also increased in  reflecting the growing acceptance of our intercept collection device and related oral fluid drug assays  as companies and criminal justice customers are increasingly shifting to oral fluid and away from traditional urine based drug testing 
we expect continuing growth in the utilization of our intercept product line  primarily in the united states and united kingdom 
we also expect to launch our uplink oral fluid rapid drugs of abuse detection system in germany and other european countries with our partner  dr ger  beginning in april an application for k clearance of this system is currently pending with the fda 
assuming this clearance is received  and subject to completion of additional market research  we also intend to market the uplink system to the workplace and criminal justice markets in the united states beginning in sales to the cryosurgical systems market grew substantially in  largely because we entered the consumer or over the counter otc market for the first time 
the cryosurgical systems market represents sales of histofreezer into both the domestic and international physicians office markets and sales of the otc formulation of this product  called freeze off  to our partner  medtech holdings  inc medtech 
medtech distributes freeze off to consumers under its compound w trademark 
sales to medtech accounted for all of the growth in this market during and more than offset a decline of histofreezer revenues in the us professional market 
while we are pleased with the level of freeze off sales and hope that they continue at the same or higher levels  these sales were largely initial stocking orders and may not be indicative of the ongoing sales levels we can expect for this channel 
we believe that sales of histofreezer in the us professional market in should return to levels seen in we experienced a significant decline in sales to the insurance risk assessment market during  primarily as a result of the loss of urine assay sales to our largest customer  labone 
these products have experienced substantial competitive pressure from home brew assays internally developed by this customer 
sales of these products are not expected to recover 
we anticipate little growth and we may continue to experience declines in this market until we are successful in developing new oral fluid based diagnostic tests for additional predictive health markers desired by the insurance industry 

table of contents we currently are in the process of transferring the manufacture of our intercept and orasure collection devices and our oral fluid western blot hiv confirmatory test from oregon to our facilities in bethlehem  pennsylvania 
while this transfer has gone well to date  we are still waiting for fda approval for the transfer of our orasure device 
any disruption of this transfer could adversely affect our ability to sell these products 
because of the regulatory approvals needed for most of our products  we often are required to rely on sole source providers for critical components and materials 
this is particularly true for our oraquick test and oral fluid western blot hiv confirmatory product 
if we are unable to obtain necessary components or materials from these sole sources  the time required to develop replacements and obtain the required fda approvals could disrupt our ability to sell the affected products 
finally  we generated approximately of our revenues in the us marketplace 
consequently  we are evaluating strategies to increase our sales penetration in markets outside the us results of operations twelve months ended december  compared to december  total revenues increased to approximately million in from approximately million in  primarily as a result of increased sales of our oraquick rapid hiv antibody test  the successful launch of the freeze off wart removal product  and higher sales of our intercept oral fluid collection device and related drug assays  partially offset by a decline in assay revenues in the insurance risk assessment market and lower sales of histofreezer in the physicians office market in the us revenues derived from products sold in countries outside the us were approximately million and million  or and of total revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the table below shows the amount of our total revenues in thousands  except generated in each of our principal markets and by licensing and product development activities 
years ended december  dollars change percentage of total revenues market revenues insurance risk assessment infectious disease testing substance abuse testing cryosurgical systems product revenues licensing and product development total revenues sales to the insurance risk assessment market declined by to approximately million in from approximately million in  primarily as a result of lower insurance testing assay sales 
we expect that sales of our urine assays will continue to come under competitive pressure because of sluggish sales and competitive conditions in the life insurance testing market 
as a result of these conditions  our laboratory customers have reduced  and are expected to continue to reduce  their purchases of these products and instead use lower cost  internally developed ie  home brew assays or testing products purchased from our competitors 
for example  as of june   labone  inc  our largest customer  stopped purchasing our urine assays 
our revenues have been negatively impacted by the loss of this business in and will likely suffer a further decline of approximately million in  when compared to revenues in the insurance risk assessment 
table of contents market 
overall  we expect revenues from this market in to be equal to or less than the level of revenues generated in sales to the infectious disease testing market increased to approximately million in  primarily as a result of higher sales of our oraquick rapid hiv antibody test 
oraquick and orasure sales in totaled approximately million and million  respectively  as compared to approximately  and million  respectively  for the comparable period in in june  abbott became a co exclusive distributor of our oraquick rapid hiv antibody test in the united states under a five year agreement  which required minimum monthly purchases 
because abbott s purchases were below these levels  we declared the agreement terminated 
however  abbott disputed the termination  and this dispute was recently resolved through binding arbitration  which held that the agreement was not terminated and will continue in effect 
in addition  consistent with the arbitrator s rulings  we recently notified abbott that our agreement was converted from co exclusive to non exclusive 
as a result of the arbitration  we will be required to fulfill abbott s purchase orders at the agreed upon price contained in the original agreement 
during the quarter ending march   we expect to incur legal fees and expenses of approximately  associated with this arbitration 
in order to improve penetration of the hospital market  we have decided to expand our internal sales force so that we can sell directly to hospitals  which was a primary market targeted by abbott 
we believe that expanding our direct sales efforts will provide us with greater control over distribution  a higher margin contribution from this product and a channel for distributing other high value added products to these customers  and allow us to provide marketing support for hospital customers 
we currently intend to establish a small  but highly effective sales force focusing on the top metropolitan areas in the country  possibly supplemented with selective telemarketing and outside sales forces  and we may develop  purchase or license additional products to be sold by this sales force to hospitals in the future 
we may also engage one or more distributors to help us penetrate the physicians office market  which is another market targeted by abbott 
abbott purchased approximately  oraquick devices in  representing approximately of the total oraquick sales in that year 
we expect abbott to purchase substantially more devices in  largely because the oraquick test is now approved by the fda for use with venipuncture whole blood samples as discussed below 
in addition  we believe that our direct sales efforts  combined with the efforts of abbott and other distribution partners  will help us gain significant market penetration in the hospital  physicians office and other markets for rapid hiv testing 
as previously announced  we have received a total of million in purchase orders from the cdc for approximately  of our oraquick rapid hiv antibody tests 
pursuant to the cdc s first purchase order  we sold  devices to the cdc in the second purchase order for an additional million  which was received in late  requires us to supply the remaining  devices to the cdc by no later than september although sales of our oraquick test are expected to increase  such sales may negatively impact sales of our orasure oral fluid collection device in the infectious disease testing market 
customers who now or in the future may purchase our orasure device for hiv testing may elect instead to purchase our oraquick test 
it is not possible at this time  however  to estimate the timing or extent of such change in purchasing patterns or the financial impact of replacing orasure sales with sales of our oraquick test  if it occurs at all 
in september  we received approval from the fda for use of the oraquick device to detect hiv antibodies in venipuncture whole blood samples 
the device had previously received fda approval for use with finger stick whole blood samples  and has received a waiver under clia clinical laboratory improvement 
table of contents amendments of 
we believe the venipuncture whole blood claim will assist us in penetrating the hospital market with our oraquick device 
we have also filed for fda approval for use of the oraquick device to detect antibodies to hiv we have taken this action in anticipation of obtaining access to an hiv patent license  either directly with bio rad laboratories bio rad  the holder of the hiv patents  or through a distribution arrangement with a third party 
during september  we also completed the remaining clinical trials and filed an application with the fda for approval of the oraquick device for use with both oral fluid and plasma samples 
we believe that an oraquick device which is approved for detecting antibodies to both hiv and on multiple sample types would enhance the versatility of our oraquick test  provide a significant competitive advantage  and allow us to more fully implement a strategy to sell oraquick internationally 
however  there is no assurance that we will receive fda approval of an hiv claim or claims for oral fluid and plasma 
we have approached bio rad about securing a world wide non exclusive license for hiv and have completed negotiation of a license agreement that we believe is complete and satisfactory to both parties 
bio rad is now in the process of securing the necessary signatures and approval from several other licensees and other relevant parties 
sales to the substance abuse testing market increased to approximately million in as a result of higher sales of our intercept oral fluid collection device and related drug assays in the workplace  criminal justice and international marketplaces  which more than offset the absence of approximately  in laboratory equipment sales included in our substance abuse testing market revenues in sales of our intercept device and related drug assays in increased  or by approximately  over the comparable period in we expect continued growth in intercept sales in as customers shift from urine based to oral fluid based testing methods 
in september  we filed an application with the fda for k clearance of our uplink rapid point of care oral fluid drug detection system  including assays for the detection of drugs of abuse commonly identified by the national institute for drug abuse nida as the nida  ie cocaine  opiates  amphetamines methamphetamines  pcp and marijuana 
we do not expect to generate revenues from the sale of this product until mid  when our partner  dr ger safety  is expected to begin distributing this product primarily in the roadside testing market in europe 
sales of our products in the cryosurgical systems market which includes both the physicians office and otc markets increased to approximately million in this increase was primarily the result of million of sales of our otc cryosurgical system to medtech holdings  inc medtech  the owner of the compound w line of wart removal products  offset by lower sales of histofreezer in the professional markets in both the us and international markets 
we entered into an agreement with medtech following receipt of fda k clearance in february for the sale of histofreezer in the otc market in the us the product  which was launched by medtech in the third quarter of  is called freeze off and is being sold under medtech s compound w trademark 
the five year distribution agreement requires minimum purchases by medtech of at least million each year over the life of the contract in order for medtech to maintain its exclusive distribution rights to the otc market in the us however  based on additional purchase orders received to date  we expect sales of product to medtech to reach at least million during the first half of sales of our histofreezer product to physicians offices in the us and international markets declined and to approximately million and million  respectively  in  when compared to  as a result of lower distributor purchases 
we anticipate that us sales of histofreezer in the professional market will decrease further in the first quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of  as a result of a 
table of contents preannounced price increase which became effective in december this type of price increase normally causes distributors to purchase additional product in advance of the increase 
we are investing in promotional programs to raise the brand awareness of histofreezer in the us marketplace and expect our full year revenues to increase over and approximate the revenue levels generated in as a result of a focused sales and marketing effort 
sales in the international market are expected to remain at approximately the levels until we are able to secure additional distributors in countries where the product is currently not sold 
it is possible that sales of the freeze off product in the us otc market may reduce the number of individuals that will seek to obtain treatment of their warts by a physician  which in turn could negatively affect sales of our histofreezer product in the professional market 
however  it is not possible at this time to estimate the timing or financial impact of such a change  if it occurs at all 
labone  our largest customer  accounted for approximately and of total revenues for and  respectively 
medtech accounted for approximately of total revenues for  their first year of business with us 
licensing and product development revenues increased to approximately  in  from approximately  in the comparable period in licensing and product development revenues in were primarily related to our collaborative uplink and oral fluid research project with the university of pennsylvania  under a grant awarded by the national institutes of health 
the current phase of this grant expires in june and we expect to receive approximately  in additional revenues through that date 
further revenues beyond june will depend on progress achieved in the research and future funding awarded by the national institutes of health 
the company s gross margin was in  which was unchanged from our gross margin was positively impacted by increased sales of intercept devices and related assays and more efficient utilization of our manufacturing capacity resulting in lower scrap and spoilage and better absorption of overhead 
offsetting these were negative contributions realized through lower urine assay and reagent sales in the insurance risk assessment market and the lower sales of histofreezer in the us professional market 
research and development expenses decreased to approximately million in  from approximately million for the comparable period in  primarily as a result of lower staffing costs  partially offset by higher outside consulting fees 
research and development costs are expected to decrease as a result of lower clinical trial and product transfer costs in sales and marketing expenses increased to approximately million in from approximately million in this increase was primarily the result of higher expenditures for advertising and collateral marketing materials  travel  compensation expense  market research and public relations fees 
included in the advertising expense for was million paid to medtech as reimbursement for marketing expenses incurred for the compound w freeze off product 
we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase significantly during as a result of our recruitment and deployment of a sales force focused on selling our oraquick test in the hospital market 
sales and marketing expenses are also expected to increase as we attempt to increase market awareness for our oraquick  intercept and histofreezer products 
pursuant to our agreement with medtech  we will also continue to co invest in medtech s marketing activities for the compound w freeze off product  and we will reimburse medtech  on a declining basis over the first four years of the agreement  for a portion of medtech s out of pocket costs of advertising and promoting this product in the otc market 
general and administrative expenses increased to approximately million in from approximately million in this increase was primarily attributable to higher facility related expenses  partially offset by the absence of a  severance charge related to the departure of the company s former chief executive officer in general and administrative expenses are expected to increase in as a result 
table of contents of the additional costs to comply with the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of and higher professional fees 
interest expense decreased to approximately  in from approximately  in  as a result of lower effective interest rates 
interest income decreased to approximately  in from approximately  in  as a result of lower interest rates on investments  partially offset by significantly higher investment balances in the fourth quarter of as a result of investing approximately million in net proceeds from our october common stock offering 
during the year ended december   a  loss on foreign currency transactions was recorded 
during the year ended december   a provision for foreign income taxes of approximately  was recorded 
twelve months ended december  compared to december  total revenues decreased to approximately million in from approximately million in the decline in revenues was primarily the result of a million decrease in licensing and product development revenues  partially offset by higher product revenues 
product revenues were approximately million in  representing an increase of over levels

dollars percentage change inc dec 
percentage of total revenues market revenues insurance risk assessment infectious disease testing substance abuse testing cryosurgical systems product revenues licensing and product development total revenues sales to the insurance risk assessment market increased by to approximately million in from approximately million in  as a result of increased sales of our orasure laboratory based hiv test  partially offset by lower sales of our urine assays and reagents 
sales of our urine assays and reagents faced increased competition as the laboratories that purchase these products were facing pressure from their insurance customers to reduce the cost of testing services 
as a result  these laboratories reduced their purchases of our products and instead used lower cost internally developed assays or reagents ie  home brews or testing products purchased from our competitors 
sales to the infectious disease testing market increased to approximately million in from approximately million in  as a result of a million increase in sales of our orasure laboratory based hiv test into the public health market  offset by a  decrease in international sales of the oraquick rapid hiv antibody test 
in june  we entered into an agreement with abbott laboratories for the co exclusive distribution of the oraquick test in the united states 
we received fda approval of the oraquick test for detecting hiv in finger stick whole blood samples in november and received a clia waiver for this product in january we shipped an initial order for approximately  of oraquick 
table of contents devices to abbott in the fourth quarter of  representing our first domestic sale of this product following fda approval 
sales to the substance abuse testing market decreased to approximately million in from approximately million in  primarily as a result of a decrease of approximately  in sales of laboratory equipment manufactured by third party vendors and the absence of approximately  in sales of uplink analyzers  which occurred in  coupled with a  decrease in sales of domestic substance abuse products 
offsetting this aggregate decrease was an approximate  increase in international sales of our intercept collection device and related assays 
sales to the cryosurgical systems market  which consisted solely of our histofreezer wart removal system to physicians offices  increased to approximately million in from approximately million in  as a result of increased product sales in the united states partially offset by lower international sales 
the increase in domestic sales of histofreezer was partially attributable to distributors increasing their inventory levels in the fourth quarter of as a result of an announced price increase in the us market  which became effective in december as a percentage of total revenues  international revenues decreased to approximately in from approximately in  with histofreezer accounting for approximately of international revenues 
this decrease was primarily attributable to lower international sales of oraquick and the absence of uplink analyzer sales to dr ger  which occurred in labone  our largest customer  and osborne group  which was acquired by labone in  together accounted for approximately and of total revenues in and  respectively 
licensing and product development revenues decreased to approximately  in from approximately million in  reflecting a significant drop in funded research and development 
during  licensing and product development revenues were primarily derived from the continued development of the uplink drugs of abuse rapid detection system under our agreement with dr ger  development of infectious disease applications for uplink under our agreement with meridian bioscience  and the second phase of a grant from the national institutes of health nih for the development of an oral fluid syphilis test 
the decrease in resulted from the absence of research and development funding from both dr ger and meridian  as our projects with these companies advanced to a stage where we became responsible for funding  and the termination of work under the nih grant for the development of the syphilis test 
our gross margin decreased to approximately in from in this decrease was primarily the result of lower licensing and product development revenues  partially offset by a more favorable product mix and our ongoing cost savings efforts 
additionally  as we prepared for fda approval and the commercial launch of oraquick in the united states during  we incurred substantial expenses related to staffing  materials and overhead 
these expenses were included in our cost of goods throughout  however  we did not begin to generate revenues from oraquick until the initial sales of this product in the united states in december we also recognized approximately million of inventory scrap in research and development expenses declined to approximately million in from approximately million in decreased expenditures for staffing  consulting and travel were partially offset by increased clinical trial costs related to our efforts to obtain fda approval of the oraquick rapid hiv antibody test 
sales and marketing expenses increased to approximately million in from approximately million in this increase was primarily the result of additional consulting fees for the development of our strategic marketing plans and increased staffing costs  offset by lower travel expenses  sales commissions and freight costs 

table of contents general and administrative expenses declined to approximately million in from approximately million in this decrease was primarily the result of lower legal  recruiting  and staffing costs offset by an approximate  severance charge related to the departure of our former chief executive officer in the first quarter of restructuring related expenses were  in these costs included expenses for employee severance and travel and transport resulting from relocating and consolidating manufacturing operations 
there were no such costs in interest expense decreased by to approximately  in from approximately  in  as a result of lower average outstanding borrowings and lower effective interest rates 
interest income decreased by to approximately  in from approximately  in  as a result of lower cash and cash equivalents available for investment and lower interest rates 
gain on the sale of securities was  in as a result of the sale of labone common stock we received as part of an intercept distribution agreement with labone  entered into in there were no such sales in liquidity and capital resources december  december  in thousands cash and cash equivalents short term investments working capital the company s cash  cash equivalents and short term investments increased approximately million during to approximately million at december   primarily as a result of the company s common stock offering that raised million  proceeds of million from stock option exercises and million in cash flow from operations offset by net debt reduction of million and purchases of capital equipment and licenses of million 
at december   the company s working capital was approximately million 
net cash provided by operating activities was approximately million in  an increase of approximately million from the  used in operations in the million of cash provided by operating activities resulted primarily from an increase in accounts payable and accruals  together with depreciation and amortization offset by the company s net loss for the year of million and a million increase in accounts receivable 
accounts receivable are expected to grow as our sales increase and the proportion of sales increase to parties such as the cdc and medtech  which have day payment terms 
net cash used in investing activities during was million 
we purchased approximately million of property and equipment and expended  on licenses  product supply and distribution agreements 
additionally  we purchased a net of million of short term investments

we also expect to purchase additional information systems equipment and to upgrade certain older equipment in net cash provided by financing activities was approximately million  reflecting the proceeds of million received from the sale of common stock and approximately million from the exercise of stock options  offset by approximately million of net loan principal repayments 

table of contents in september  we entered into a million credit facility the credit facility with comerica bank 
the credit facility  when originally executed  was comprised of an  mortgage loan  a million term loan  a million non revolving equipment line of credit  and a million revolving working capital line of credit 
in september  we executed an amendment to the credit facility 
pursuant to this amendment  the million non revolving equipment line of credit the original non revolving line was replaced with a new million non revolving line of credit for the purchase of both capital equipment and software the new non revolving line 
as a result  the original non revolving line has expired and any new non revolving borrowings for equipment or software will be made under the new non revolving line 
borrowings outstanding under the original non revolving line at the time of the amendment will not be applied against the credit limit for the new non revolving line and will remain payable in accordance with their original terms 
the amendment also extended the maturity date of the million revolving working capital line of credit for one year  and provided for certain modifications to our financial covenants under the credit facility 
the term loan and mortgage were not affected by the amendment

in october  we entered into new agreements with biom rieux  inc bmx  which replaced existing agreements between the parties  for the supply by bmx of hiv antigen required to manufacture our oral fluid western blot hiv confirmatory test  and for the distribution by bmx of the oral fluid western blot product on an exclusive worldwide basis 
these agreements have an initial term ending december   which may be extended until december  under certain circumstances 
as consideration for bmx entering into the new agreements  we paid bmx  in installments through march  we have entered into a ten year facility lease with tech iii partners  llc tech partners  an entity owned and controlled by two of our executive officers see certain relationships and related transactions  included herein 
under the terms of this operating lease  we began leasing a  square foot facility in october at a base rent of  per year  increasing to  per year  during the initial ten year term 
the base rental may be increased after the fifth year of the initial term in order to reflect changes in the interest rate on debt incurred by tech partners to finance construction of the leased facilities 
we have not guaranteed any debt incurred by tech partners 
the lease also provides us with options to renew the lease for an additional five years at a rental rate of  per year  and to purchase the facility at any time during the initial ten year term based on a formula set forth in the lease 
the combination of our current cash position and available borrowings under our credit facility is expected to be sufficient to fund our foreseeable operating and capital needs 
however  our cash requirements may vary materially from those now planned due to many factors  including  but not limited to  the scope and timing of strategic acquisitions  the cost and timing of the expansion of our manufacturing capacity  the progress of our research and development programs  the scope and results of clinical testing  the magnitude of capital expenditures  changes in existing and potential relationships with business partners  the time and cost of obtaining regulatory approvals  the costs involved in obtaining and enforcing patents  proprietary rights and any necessary licenses  the cost and timing of expansion of sales and marketing activities  the timing of commercial launch of new products  market acceptance of new products  competing technological and market developments  the potential exercise of our options to purchase one  or both  of our leased facilities in bethlehem  pennsylvania  and other factors

on an on going basis  we evaluate our judgments and estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  revenue recognition  restructuring costs  contingencies  and litigation 
we base our judgments and estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the financial statements included in item of this report 
we consider the following accounting estimates  which have been discussed with our audit committee  to be most critical in understanding the more complex judgments that are involved in preparing our financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact our results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
revenue recognition 
we follow us securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab no 

this bulletin draws on existing accounting rules and provides specific guidance on revenue recognition of up front non refundable licensing and development fees 
we license certain products or technology to outside third parties  in return for which we receive up front licensing fees 
some of these fees can be significant 
in accordance with sab no 
 we recognize this revenue ratably over the related license period 
we also enter into research and development contracts with corporate  government and or private entities 
these contracts generally provide for payments to us upon achievement of certain research or development milestones 
product development revenues from these contracts are recognized only if the specified milestone is achieved and accepted by the customer and payment from the customer is probable 
any amounts received prior to the performance of product development efforts are recorded as deferred revenues 
recognition of revenue under these contracts can be sporadic  as it is the result of achieving specific research and development milestones 
furthermore  revenue from future milestone payments will not be recognized if the underlying research and development milestone is not achieved 
we recognize product revenues when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  title has passed and collection is reasonably assured 
product revenues are net of allowances for any discounts or rebates 
we do not grant price protection or product return rights to our customers  except for warranty returns 
where a product fails to comply with its limited warranty  we can either replace the product or provide the customer with a refund of the purchase price or credit against future purchases 

table of contents historically  returns arising from warranty issues have been infrequent and immaterial 
accordingly  we expense warranty returns as incurred 
while such returns have been immaterial in the past  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same rate of warranty claims as we have in the past 
any significant increase in product warranty claims could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the period in which the claims occur 
allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable 
accounts receivable are reduced by an estimated allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
on an ongoing basis  we perform credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon the customer s payment history and creditworthiness  as determined by a review of their current credit information 
we also continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers 
based upon historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that are identified  we use our judgment to establish and evaluate the adequacy of our allowance for estimated credit losses  which was  at december  while credit losses have been within our expectations and the allowance provided  these losses can vary from period to period   and  in  and  respectively 
furthermore  there is no assurance that we will experience credit losses at the same rates as we have in the past 
also  at december   approximately million or of our accounts receivable were due from two major customers 
any significant changes in the liquidity or financial position of these customers  or others  could have a material adverse impact on the collectibility of our accounts receivable and future operating results 
inventories 
our inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market  determined on a first in  first out basis  and include the cost of raw materials  labor and overhead 
the majority of our inventories are subject to expiration dating 
we continually evaluate the carrying value of our inventories and when  in the opinion of management  factors indicate that impairment has occurred  either a reserve is established against the inventories carrying value or the inventories are completely written off 
we base these decisions on the level of inventories on hand in relation to our estimated forecast of product demand  production requirements over the next twelve months and the expiration dates of raw materials and finished goods 
during  and  we wrote off inventory which had a cost of approximately  million and million  respectively  as a result of scrap levels and product expiration issues 
forecasting product demand can be a complex process  especially for a new product such as our oraquick rapid hiv antibody test  which was launched in the united states in november although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand could have a significant impact on the carrying value of our inventories and reported operating results 
long lived and intangible assets 
our long lived assets are comprised of property and equipment and an investment in a nonaffiliated entity  and our intangible assets primarily consist of patents and product rights 
together  these assets have a net book value of approximately million or of our total assets at december  our investment in a privately held nonaffiliated company is recorded under the cost method of accounting because we do not have a controlling interest in this company nor do we have the ability to exert significant influence over the operating and financial policies of this investee company 
property and equipment  patents and product rights are amortized on a straight line basis over their useful lives  which we determine based upon our estimate of the period of time over which each asset will generate revenues 
an impairment of long lived or intangible assets could occur whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the net book value of these assets may not be recoverable 
events which could trigger an asset impairment include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of an asset or in our strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  shortening of product life cycles or changes in technology  and negative financial performance of our nonaffiliated investee company 
if we believe impairment of an asset has occurred  we measure the amount of such impairment by comparing the net book value of the affected assets to the fair value of these assets  which is generally determined based upon the present value of the expected cash flows associated with the 
table of contents use of these assets 
if the net book value exceeds the fair value of the impaired assets  we would incur an impairment expense equal to this difference 
we currently believe the future cash flows to be received from our long lived and intangible assets will exceed their book value and  as such  we have not recognized any impairment losses through december  any unanticipated significant impairment in the future  however  could have a material adverse impact to our balance sheet and future operating results 
deferred tax assets 
at december   we have federal net operating loss nol carryforwards of approximately million 
the deferred tax asset associated with these nols and other temporary differences is approximately million at december  in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the period in which those temporary differences become deductible 
we consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
based upon our cumulative and recent history of losses and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible  we believe that a full valuation allowance is necessary at december  our level of future profitability could cause us to conclude that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will be realizable 
upon reaching such a conclusion  we would immediately record the estimated net realizable value of the deferred tax asset and would begin to provide for income taxes at a rate equal to our combined federal and state effective rates  which we believe would approximate 
subsequent revisions to the estimated net realizable value of the deferred tax asset could cause our provision for income taxes to vary significantly from period to period 
contingencies 
in the ordinary course of business  we have entered into various contractual relationships with strategic corporate partners  customers  distributors  research laboratories and universities  licensors  licensees  suppliers  vendors and other parties 
as such  we could be subject to litigation  claims or assessments arising from any or all of these relationships 
we account for contingencies such as these in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
sfas no 
requires us to record an estimated loss contingency when information available prior to issuance of our financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
accounting for contingencies arising from contractual or legal proceedings requires that we use our best judgment when estimating an accrual related to such contingencies 
as additional information becomes known  our accrual for a loss contingency could fluctuate  thereby creating variability in our results of operations from period to period 
likewise  an actual loss arising from a loss contingency which significantly exceeds the amount accrued for in our financial statements could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the period in which such actual loss becomes known 
certain relationships and related transactions we have entered into a commercial lease the lease with tech iii partners  llc tech partners  which provided for the construction of a  square foot facility on land adjacent to our bethlehem  pennsylvania headquarters  and the lease of that facility to us 
tech partners is owned and controlled by michael j 
gausling  the company s president and chief executive officer  and dr 
r 
sam niedbala  the company s executive vice president and chief science officer 
the facility houses manufacturing and administrative operations required to support the expected growth of our business 
construction of the facility was completed in october the lease  as amended  has an initial ten year term ending in october and a base rent starting at  and increasing to  per year over that term 
the base rental rate may be increased after the fifth year of the initial term in order to reflect changes in the interest rate on debt incurred by tech partners to finance construction of the leased facilities 
we have not guaranteed any debt incurred by tech partners 
the lease also provides us with options to renew the lease for an additional five years at a rental rate of  per year  and to purchase the facility at any time during the initial ten year term based on a formula set forth in the lease 

table of contents prior to deciding to enter into the lease and an amendment increasing the base rental to reflect the cost of certain tenant fit out improvements  our board of directors retained imperial realty appraisal llc  an independent commercial real estate appraisal firm  to evaluate the proposed base rental rate 
imperial realty issued opinions indicating that the annual base rent set forth in the lease  as amended  is below the market rental rate we could otherwise expect to pay to lease a comparable commercial property in the same general geographic market 
the terms of the lease are otherwise substantially similar to a commercial lease we entered into with a third party for our existing bethlehem  pennsylvania headquarters 
in january  we terminated the employment agreement with robert d 
thompson  our former chief executive officer  and mr 
thompson entered into a severance agreement pursuant to which mr 
thompson received approximately  we also held a  note receivable previously made to mr

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not hold any amounts of derivative financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments and  accordingly  we have no material derivative risk to report under this item 
our holdings of financial instruments are comprised of certificates of deposit  commercial paper  us government and agency obligations  state and local government agency obligations  and us corporate bonds 
all such instruments are classified as available for sale securities 
our debt security portfolio represents funds held temporarily pending use in our business and operations 
we seek reasonable assuredness of the safety of principal and market liquidity by investing in rated fixed income securities while at the same time seeking to 
table of contents achieve a favorable rate of return 
market risk exposure consists principally of exposure to changes in interest rates 
if changes in interest rates would affect the investments adversely  we could decide to hold the security to maturity or sell the security 
our holdings are also exposed to the risks of changes in the credit quality of issuers 
we typically invest in the shorter end of the maturity spectrum 
we do not currently have any foreign currency exchange contracts or purchase currency options to hedge local currency cash flows 
we have operations in the netherlands  which are subject to foreign currency fluctuations 
as currency rates change  translation of revenues and expenses for these operations from euros to us dollars affects year to year comparability of operating results 
sales denominated in a foreign currency represented approximately million or of our total revenues for the year ended december  we do not expect the risk of foreign currency fluctuations to be material
