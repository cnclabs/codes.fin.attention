item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview cohu s primary business activity involves the development  manufacture  marketing  sale and servicing of test handling equipment for the global semiconductor industry 
during the three year period ended december   the semiconductor equipment industry experienced a severe business downturn 
our net sales in each of the last three years declined more than from the record year 
this decrease in revenue is generally comparable to most other companies in the semiconductor equipment industry  particularly the back end semiconductor equipment companies that would be considered the closest to cohu in terms of business cycles 
our operating results in the last three years have been impacted by charges to cost of sales related to excess and obsolete and lower of cost or market inventory issues 
these charges totaled approximately million during the three year period ended december  and were primarily the result of decreases to customer forecasts  competitive conditions in the test handler industry and  to a lesser extent  changes in our sales product mix as a result of new product introductions 
exposures related to inventories are common in the semiconductor equipment industry due to the narrow customer base  the custom nature of the products and inventory and the shortened product life cycles caused by rapid changes in semiconductor manufacturing technology 
increased competition  particularly in the last several years  has also negatively impacted our gross margins and we believe it is likely these conditions will exist for the foreseeable future 
our other operating costs consist of research and development r d and selling  general and administrative expenses sg a 
sg a has been relatively consistent during the last three years while our r d expense declined in  in part as a result of the closure of our columbus engineering operation 
our non semiconductor equipment businesses have comprised approximately of our revenues during the last three years 
the operating results of these businesses have deteriorated over the last several years and they accounted for a significant portion of our loss from operations in our financial condition remains very strong with significant cash and short term investments and no long term debt 
despite the severe downturn  during the three year period ended december  we generated million of net cash from operating activities and total cash and investments have increased from million at december  to million at december  critical accounting policies and estimates cohu s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon cohu s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires cohu to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  cohu evaluates its estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes  warranty obligations and contingencies and litigation 
cohu bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
cohu believes the following critical accounting policies  that are more fully described in the cohu consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k  affect the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition cohu generally recognizes revenue upon shipment and title passage for established products ie  those that have previously satisfied customer acceptance requirements that provide for full payment tied to shipment 
revenue for products that have not previously satisfied customer acceptance 
table of contents requirements or from sales where customer payment dates are not determinable is recognized upon customer acceptance 
accounts receivable cohu maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of cohu s customers deteriorates  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
warranty cohu provides for the estimated costs of product warranties in the period sales are recognized 
cohu s warranty obligation estimates are affected by historical product shipment levels  product performance and material and labor costs incurred in correcting product performance problems 
should product performance  material usage or labor repair costs differ from cohu s estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
inventory cohu records valuation reserves on its inventory for estimated excess and obsolete inventory and lower of cost or market concerns equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future product demand  market conditions and product selling prices 
if future product demand  market conditions or product selling prices are less or more favorable than those projected by management or if continued modifications to products are required to meet specifications or other customer requirements  changes to inventory reserves may be required 
income taxes cohu estimates income taxes based on the various jurisdictions where we conduct business 
this requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure and to assess temporary differences that result from differing treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities that are reflected in the consolidated balance sheet 
the net deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if  based upon all available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
establishing a valuation allowance or increasing this allowance in an accounting period results in tax expense in the statement of operations 
cohu must make significant judgments to determine the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against net deferred tax assets 
our net deferred tax asset balance as of december  was million  net of a valuation allowance of million 
we recorded the valuation allowance in the fourth quarters of and as a result of our recent losses and to reflect uncertainties concerning our ability to generate future taxable income and our corresponding ability to utilize our deferred tax assets 
the deferred tax assets consist primarily of deductible temporary differences  tax credit and net operating loss carryforwards 
intangible assets at december   intangible assets other than goodwill were evaluated for impairment using undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets as required by fasb statement no 
and we concluded there was no impairment loss 
cohu is required to assess goodwill impairment using the methodology prescribed by fasb statement no 
statement no 
requires that goodwill be tested for impairment on an annual basis and more frequently in certain circumstances 
the required annual goodwill impairment test is performed as of october of each year 
cohu did not recognize any goodwill impairment as a result of performing this annual test 
contingencies cohu is subject to certain contingencies that arise in the ordinary course of its businesses 
in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for contingencies  we assess the likelihood that future events will confirm the existence of a loss or an impairment of an asset 
if a loss or asset impairment is probable  as defined in statement no 
and the amount of the loss or impairment is reasonably estimable  we accrue a charge to operations in the period such conditions become known 
recent accounting pronouncements in june   the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
statement no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies emerging issues task force issue no 
the adoption of statement no 
is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after 
table of contents december   including the consolidation of cohu s columbus  ohio and littleton  massachusetts facilities in in november   the fasb emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
eitf issue no 
provides guidance on how to account for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services and or rights to use assets 
the provisions of eitf issue no 
apply to revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  the adoption of eitf issue no 
did not have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
in january   the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
fin was revised in december  and clarifies the application of arb to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support 
the application of fin may require that an entity be subject to consolidation even though the investor does not have a controlling financial interest that  under arb  was usually deemed to exist through ownership of a majority voting interest 
fin  as revised  is generally effective for all entities subject to the interpretation no later than the end of the first reporting period that ends after march  the company currently has no investments in entities within the scope of fin and as a result does not believe its application will have a material effect on the company s financial statements 
in april   the fasb issued statement no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement provides clarification on the financial accounting and reporting of derivative instruments and hedging activities and requires contracts with similar characteristics to be accounted for on a comparable basis 
the adoption of no 
 which is effective for contracts entered into or modified after june   had no material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
in may   the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
this statement establishes standards on the classification and measurement of financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity and is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may  the implementation of this pronouncement had no material effect on cohu s financial condition or results of operations 
results of operations the following table summarizes certain operating data as a percentage of net sales for the three year period ended december  net sales cost of sales gross margin research and development selling  general and administrative gain on sale of facilities acquired in process research and development loss from operations 
table of contents compared to net sales our net sales increased to million in  compared to net sales of million in sales of semiconductor test handling equipment in increased from the period and accounted for of consolidated net sales in  versus in sales of television cameras and other equipment accounted for of net sales in and decreased when compared to  while the combined sales of metal detection and microwave equipment decreased from at december   we had deferred revenue totaling approximately million and deferred profit of million 
at december   we had deferred revenue totaling approximately million and deferred profit of million 
gross margin gross margin as a percentage of net sales decreased to in from in  primarily as a result of changes in product mix  intangible asset amortization expense totaling million in and increased charges to cost of sales 
cohu computes the majority of its excess and obsolete inventory reserve requirements using a one year inventory usage forecast 
during and  we recorded charges to cost of sales of approximately million and million  respectively  primarily as a result of declines in customer forecasts for certain products  lower of cost or market inventory writedowns and other business issues that negatively impacted our forecasted inventory usage 
while we believe our reserves for excess and obsolete inventory and lower of cost or market concerns are adequate to cover our known exposures at december   reductions in customer forecasts or continued modifications to products  including our recently introduced delta edge handler  as a result of our failure to meet specifications or other customer requirements will result in additional charges to operations that could negatively impact our gross margin in future periods 
conversely  if our actual inventory usage is greater than our forecasted usage  our gross margin in future periods may be favorably impacted 
research and development expense r d as a percentage of net sales was in  compared to in  decreasing in absolute dollars from million in  to million in the decrease in r d was primarily the result of lower r d material and labor costs for product development in the semiconductor equipment business resulting  in part  from the closure of our facility in columbus  ohio 
in addition  in r d expense included million of intangible asset amortization 
selling  general and administrative expense sg a as a percentage of net sales increased to in  from in  increasing from million in to million in the increase in sg a was due to  among other things  higher insurance costs 
interest income interest income was million and million in and  respectively 
the decrease in interest income was due to lower interest rates in income taxes the provision benefit for income taxes expressed as a percentage of pretax income loss was in and in the provision benefit for income taxes differs from the u 
s federal statutory rate primarily due to tax credits  export sales benefits  changes in the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets and settlement of prior period tax returns and adjustments to prior year tax accruals 
at december   cohu assessed the need for a valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets 
realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon the company generating sufficient taxable income  in appropriate tax jurisdictions  in future years  to obtain benefit from the reversal of temporary differences and net operating tax loss and credit carryforwards 
at december   the company recorded a valuation allowance of approximately million compared to million at december  against deferred tax assets due to the uncertainties surrounding their 
table of contents realization 
the amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable was determined based on tax planning strategies and conservative estimates of future income and is subject to adjustment in future periods should cohu determine that estimates of future taxable income are reduced or increased 
the internal revenue service irs is currently conducting an examination of cohu s consolidated tax returns for the period through the company expects the irs examination to be completed in any adjustments that result from the irs examination will be reflected in our income tax accounts 
we believe that such adjustments  if any  are adequately provided for in the consolidated financial statements 
other items on april   cohu announced that its delta design subsidiary was relocating its littleton  massachusetts operation to its headquarters facility in poway  california 
cohu expects the consolidation to be substantially completed by march  cohu expects to incur charges in totaling approximately million for severance and other related exit costs 
we recorded charges to operations in the year ended december  totaling approximately million primarily for severance 
for further details see note to the consolidated financial statements in item in december   cohu invested million in kryotech  inc preferred stock 
in june   we wrote off the investment and recorded a million charge as the investment was deemed impaired and such impairment was considered other than temporary  under the guidelines of apb no 
in april   cohu s delta design subsidiary completed the relocation of its columbus  ohio operations to its headquarters facility in poway  california 
cohu recorded charges to operations in the year ended december   totaling million for severance and one time termination benefits and other related exit costs 
on april   cohu sold twelve acres of land in poway  california held for future development for million in net cash proceeds resulting in a pretax gain of approximately million 
in  cohu through its broadcast microwave services bms subsidiary  was awarded an million contract from the united arab emirates uae armed services to provide microwave communications equipment for a command center and infrastructure system for border security 
the contract  which utilizes our most advanced microwave communications technology that has not previously been installed in an application of this size and complexity  requires that of the total contract price be paid after the system has been fully accepted by the customer 
as a result of these factors and the inability to make reasonably dependable estimates of progress toward completion and acceptance  cohu will recognize all revenue and related costs under this contract in the period the system is accepted by the customer 
through december   we had shipped inventory with a sales value of million and deferred costs of approximately million resulting in deferred profit of approximately million under the contract 
in addition  at december  we had inventory to be delivered under the contract of approximately million and related accounts receivable of approximately million 
cohu has also provided the customer with a standby letter of credit totaling approximately million at december   that may be drawn upon if bms does not fulfill the terms of the contract 
we currently expect equipment and system installation to be completed in if bms is unable to successfully complete the installation of the equipment and obtain customer acceptance of the system  the related inventory and receivables may need to be written off  the customer might seek a refund of the million in payments made to bms under the contract and our business  results of operations and financial condition would be materially impacted 
as a result of the factors set forth above  our net loss was  in compared to a net loss of million in 
table of contents compared to net sales cohu continued to be impacted by the downturn in the semiconductor equipment industry that began in late despite the downturn  our net sales increased to million in  compared to net sales of million in sales of semiconductor test handling equipment in increased from the period and accounted for of consolidated net sales in  versus in sales of television cameras and other equipment accounted for of net sales in and decreased when compared to  while the combined sales of metal detection and microwave equipment increased 
gross margin gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased to in from in  primarily as a result of higher margins in the semiconductor equipment business 
within the semiconductor equipment segment  margins increased in  primarily as a result of decreased provisions for excess and obsolete inventory 
during and  we recorded charges to cost of sales of approximately million and million  respectively  primarily as a result of declines in customer forecasts that negatively impacted our forecasted inventory usage 
research and development expense r d as a percentage of net sales was in  compared to in  increasing in absolute dollars from million in  to million in the increase in r d was primarily the result of higher r d labor costs as a result of the automated systems acquisition completed in july   increased spending on product development in the semiconductor equipment business and the write off and amortization of certain intangible assets of million 
selling  general and administrative expense sg a as a percentage of net sales decreased to in  from in  primarily as a result of the increase in business volume 
sg a expense in  was favorably impacted by a million reduction in the allowance for doubtful accounts and bad debt expense 
interest income interest income was million and million in and  respectively 
the decline in interest income was due to lower interest rates 
income taxes the benefit for income taxes expressed as a percentage of the pretax loss was in and in the benefit for income taxes in  was higher than the u 
s federal statutory rate primarily due to tax credits  the settlement of prior tax returns and adjustments to prior year tax accruals and export sales tax benefits offset by the establishment of a valuation allowance of approximately million against deferred tax assets due to the uncertainties surrounding their realization 
other items cohu recognized a pretax gain in of approximately million from the sale of its san diego facilities and a pretax charge of approximately million for acquired in process research and development as a result of cohu s july  purchase of the assets of automated systems 
cohu evaluated the intangible assets other than goodwill for impairment at december   as required by fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets 
we compared the undiscounted net cash flows expected to result from the use of the intangible assets  including related goodwill  to their carrying value 
as a result of this analysis  we determined that the intangible assets  other than goodwill  that resulted from the automated systems acquisition were impaired and an impairment loss of million  representing the excess of the assets carrying value over their fair value  was recorded in the fourth quarter of the impairment loss and amortization previously recorded is included in r d expense 

table of contents as a result of the factors set forth above  our net loss was million in  compared to a net loss of million in liquidity and capital resources our net cash flows used for operating activities in totaled million 
the major components of cash flows used for operating activities were a net loss of  a million gain from the sale of land  deferred income taxes of million  a million investment writedown  the net change in current assets and liabilities totaling million and depreciation and amortization of million 
net cash used for investing activities included million for the purchase of short term investments  less sales and maturities  and purchases of property  plant and equipment and other assets of million  offset by a million payment on a note receivable and net proceeds of million from the sale of land 
cash provided by financing activities included million received from the issuance of stock upon the exercise of stock options  offset by million for the payment of dividends 
cohu has a million bank line of credit  of which approximately million has been allocated to outstanding standby letters of credit  and working capital of million at december  we anticipate that present working capital and available borrowings under the line of credit will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for at least the next twelve months 
off balance sheet arrangements during the ordinary course of business  cohu provides standby letters of credit instruments to certain parties as required 
as of december   the maximum potential amount of future payments that cohu could be required to make under these standby letters of credit was approximately million 
cohu has not recorded any liability in connection with these arrangements beyond that required to appropriately account for the underlying transaction being guaranteed 
cohu does not believe  based on historical experience and information currently available  that it is probable that any amounts will be required to be paid under these arrangements 
future payments for operating leases and inventory purchase commitments as of december  were as follows fiscal year total in thousands non cancelable operating leases purchase commitments trends  risks and uncertainties the semiconductor industry we serve is highly volatile and unpredictable 
cohu s operating results are substantially dependent on our semiconductor equipment business 
this capital equipment business is in turn highly dependent on the overall strength of the semiconductor industry 
historically  the semiconductor industry has been highly cyclical with recurring periods of oversupply and excess capacity  which often have had a significant effect on the semiconductor industry s demand for capital equipment  including equipment of the type manufactured and marketed by cohu 
we anticipate that the markets for newer generations of semiconductors and semiconductor equipment may also be subject to similar cycles and severe downturns  such as those experienced in  and late  continuing throughout  and reductions in capital equipment investment by semiconductor manufacturers and semiconductor test subcontractors will materially and adversely affect our business  financial position and results of operations 
in addition  the volatile and unpredictable nature of semiconductor equipment demand has in the past and may in the future expose us to significant excess and obsolete and lower of cost or market inventory write offs and reserve requirements 
in the years ended december   and  we recorded pretax inventory related charges of approximately million  million and million  respectively  primarily as a result of changes in customer forecasts 

table of contents a limited number of customers account for a substantial percentage of our net sales 
we rely on a limited number of customers for a substantial percentage of our net sales 
in the year ended december   two customers of the semiconductor equipment segment accounted for in  and in of our net sales 
during the past five years  the percentage of cohu s sales derived from each of these and other significant customers has varied greatly 
such variations are due to changes in the customer s business and their purchase of products from our competitors 
it is common in the semiconductor test handler industry for customers to purchase equipment from more than one equipment supplier  increasing the risk that our competitive position with a specific customer may deteriorate 
no assurance can be given that we will continue to maintain our competitive position with these or other significant customers 
furthermore  we expect the percentage of our revenues derived from significant customers will vary greatly in future periods 
the loss of  or a significant reduction in  orders by these or other significant customers as a result of competitive products  market conditions  outsourcing final semiconductor test to test subcontractors that are not our customers or other factors  would adversely impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
furthermore  the concentration of our revenues in a limited number of large customers may cause significant fluctuations in our future annual and quarterly operating results 
the semiconductor equipment industry in general  and the test handler market in particular  is highly competitive 
the semiconductor test handler industry is intensely competitive and we face substantial competition from numerous companies throughout the world 
the test handler industry  while relatively small in terms of worldwide market size compared to other segments of the semiconductor equipment industry  has an inordinately large number of participants resulting in intense competitive pricing pressures that have diminished the importance of installed base as a competitive advantage 
future competition may include companies that do not currently supply test handlers 
the japanese and korean markets for test handling equipment are large and represent a significant percentage of the worldwide market 
during the last five years we have had only limited sales to japanese and korean customers who have historically purchased test handling equipment from asian suppliers 
some of our competitors have substantially greater financial  engineering  manufacturing and customer support capabilities and offer more extensive product offerings than cohu 
in addition  there are emerging semiconductor equipment companies that provide or may provide innovative technology incorporated in products that may compete favorably against those of cohu 
we expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their current products and introduce new products with improved performance capabilities 
our failure to introduce new products in a timely manner  the introduction by our competitors of products with perceived or actual advantages  or disputes over rights of cohu or our competitors to use certain intellectual property or technology could result in a loss of our competitive position and reduced sales of or margins on our existing products 
we believe that competitive conditions in the semiconductor test handler market have intensified over the last several years 
this intense competition has adversely impacted our product average selling prices and gross margins 
if we are unable to reduce the cost of our existing products and successfully introduce new lower cost products we expect these competitive conditions to negatively impact our gross margin and operating results for the foreseeable future 
semiconductor equipment is subject to rapid technological change  product introductions and transitions may result in inventory write offs and our new product development involves numerous risks and uncertainties 
semiconductor equipment and processes are subject to rapid technological change 
we believe that our future success will depend in part on our ability to enhance existing products and develop new products with improved performance capabilities 
we expect to continue to invest heavily in research and development and must manage product transitions successfully  as introductions of new products  including our recently introduced delta edge handler  are likely to adversely impact sales or margins of existing products 
in addition  the introduction of new products by cohu or by our competitors  the concentration of our revenues in a limited number of large customers  the migration to new semiconductor test handling methodologies and the custom nature of our inventory parts increases the risk that our established products and related inventory may become obsolete  resulting in significant excess and obsolete inventory exposure 
this increased exposure resulted in 
table of contents significant charges to operations during each of the three years in the period ended december  future inventory write offs and increased inventory reserve requirements could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
the design  development  commercial introduction and manufacture of new semiconductor test handling equipment is an inherently complex process that involves a number of risks and uncertainties 
these risks include potential problems in meeting customer acceptance and performance requirements  integration of the test handler with other suppliers equipment and the customers manufacturing processes  transitioning from product development to volume manufacturing and the ability of the equipment to satisfy the semiconductor industry s constantly evolving needs and achieve commercial acceptance at prices that produce satisfactory profit margins 
the design and development of new test handling equipment is heavily influenced by changes in integrated circuit ic assembly  test and final manufacturing processes and ic package design changes 
we believe that the rate of change in such processes and ic packages is accelerating 
as a result of these changes and other factors  assessing the market potential and commercial viability of new ic test handling equipment is extremely difficult and subject to a great deal of risk 
in addition  not all ic manufacturers employ the same manufacturing processes 
differences in such processes make it difficult to design standard semiconductor test handler products that are capable of achieving broad market acceptance 
as a result  we might not accurately assess the semiconductor industry s future test handler requirements and fail to design and develop products that meet such requirements and achieve market acceptance 
failure to accurately assess customer requirements and market trends for new semiconductor test handler products may have a material adverse impact on our operations  financial condition and results of operations 
the transition from product development to the manufacture of new semiconductor equipment is a difficult process and delays in product introductions and problems in manufacturing such equipment are common 
we have in the past and continue to experience difficulties in manufacturing and volume production of our new test handlers including our latest product offering  the delta edge 
in addition  our after sale support and warranty costs have been significantly higher with new test handlers than with our established products 
future technologies  processes and product developments may render our current or future product offerings obsolete and we might not be able to develop  introduce and successfully manufacture new products or make enhancements to our existing products in a timely manner to satisfy customer requirements or achieve market acceptance 
furthermore  we might not realize acceptable profit margins on such products 
we are exposed to risks associated with acquisitions and investments 
cohu has made  and may in the future make  acquisitions of  or significant investments in  businesses with complementary products  services and or technologies 
in july   cohu acquired the assets of the automated systems business from schlumberger technologies  inc for million in cash 
a significant portion of the purchase price was allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets 
in the fourth quarter of  cohu invested million in kryotech  inc preferred stock  that was written off in june   and million in intangible assets for certain technology 
acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks  including  but not limited to difficulties and increased costs in connection with integration of the personnel  operations  technologies and products of acquired businesses  diversion of management s attention from other operational matters  the potential loss of key employees of acquired businesses  lack of synergy  or the inability to realize expected synergies  resulting from the acquisition  failure to commercialize purchased technology  and the impairment of acquired intangible assets and goodwill that could result in significant charges to operating results in future periods 
in addition  such acquisitions or investments may result in immediate charges to operating results 
mergers  acquisitions and investments are inherently risky and the inability to effectively manage these risks could materially and adversely affect cohu s business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents we have taken and may continue to take remedial measures to address the slowdown in the semiconductor equipment industry that may affect our ability to be competitive 
we have taken and will continue to assess the need to take remedial measures to address the slowdown in the market for our products 
in particular  we reduced our workforce  including reductions in september and october  and january and march   delayed salary increases  reduced senior executives pay  implemented furloughs  announced facilities consolidations and reduced expense budgets 
in january and april   we announced the consolidation of delta design s columbus  ohio and littleton  massachusetts operations into our poway  california facility 
further workforce reductions are possible if the market for our products does not improve or we are unable to achieve sustained profitability 
each of these measures could have long term effects on our business by reducing our pool of technical talent  decreasing or slowing improvements in our products and making it more difficult for us to respond to customers needs 
our backlog is limited and may not accurately reflect future business activity 
our order backlog has historically represented approximately three months of revenue and as a result our visibility of future business activity is limited 
due to the possibility of customer changes in delivery schedules  cancellation of orders  potential delays in product shipments  difficulties in obtaining inventory parts from suppliers  failure to satisfy customer acceptance requirements and the inability to recognize revenue under accounting requirements  our backlog at any point in time may not be representative of sales in any future period 
furthermore  all orders are subject to cancellation or rescheduling by the customer with limited penalty 
a reduction in backlog during any particular period could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  backlog at december   may not be a reliable indicator of revenues in future periods due to delayed delivery dates or customer requested changes to delivery schedules  order cancellations and delays in recognizing revenue due to accounting requirements 
the cyclical nature of the semiconductor equipment industry places enormous demands on our employees  operations and infrastructure 
the semiconductor equipment industry is characterized by dramatic and sometimes volatile changes in demand for its products 
changes in product demand result from a number of factors including the semiconductor industry s continually changing and unpredictable capacity requirements and changes in ic design and packaging 
sudden changes in demand for semiconductor equipment have a significant impact on our operations 
in response to a severe industry downturn in  we reduced our total workforce by approximately 
during  we increased our workforce by more than as business conditions in the semiconductor equipment industry and our order backlog improved 
in  we reduced our workforce approximately as a result of a downturn in the semiconductor equipment industry 
workforce reductions continued in the third and fourth quarter of and january and march  in january and april   we announced the consolidation of delta design s columbus  ohio and littleton  massachusetts operations into our poway  california facility 
such radical changes in workforce levels place enormous demands on our employees  operations and infrastructure since newly hired personnel rarely possess the expertise and level of experience of current employees 
additionally  these transitions divert management time and attention from other activities and adversely impact employee morale 
we have in the past and may in the future experience difficulties  particularly in manufacturing  in training and recruiting the large number of additions to our workforce 
the volatility in headcount and business levels  combined with the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry  may require that we invest substantial amounts in new operational and financial systems  procedures and controls 
we may not be able to successfully adjust our systems  facilities and production capacity to meet our customers changing requirements 
the inability to meet such requirements will have an adverse impact on our business  financial position and results of operations 
we have experienced a significant decline in gravity feed test handler sales to dram customers 
sales of gravity feed ic test handlers used in dram testing represented a significant percentage of cohu s total semiconductor equipment related revenue during the period through due to changes in ic package technology  gravity feed handlers are no longer suitable for handling many types of drams 
as a result  we have seen a significant decline in sales of our gravity feed test handler products 
pick and place ic handlers used 
table of contents in dram applications account for a significant portion of the worldwide ic handler market and cohu s market share in the dram segment is negligible 
cohu s share of the gravity feed handler market for the last five years has been negligible  and with the announced closure of our littleton  massachusetts operations  we will no longer sell gravity feed test handlers 
such handlers are used in numerous non dram applications and continue to represent a significant portion of the worldwide test handler market 
because we do not participate in the dram and or gravity feed market segments  our total available sales market is limited and as a result our business and results of operations have been and will continue to be negatively impacted 
we are exposed to the risks of operating a global business 
cohu has operations located in various parts of the world to support our sales and services to the global semiconductor industry 
in the fourth quarter of  we established a small manufacturing operation near manila in the philippines 
managing geographically dispersed operations presents difficult challenges associated with  among other things  organizational alignment and infrastructure  communications and information technology  inventory control  customer relationship management  terrorist threats and related security matters and cultural diversities 
in addition  maintaining these geographically dispersed locations is expensive 
we may not be able to manage our multiple operations in a cost effective and efficient manner 
if we are unsuccessful in managing such operations effectively  our business and results of operations will be adversely affected 
failure of critical suppliers to deliver sufficient quantities of parts in a timely and cost effective manner could adversely impact our operations 
we use numerous vendors to supply parts  components and subassemblies for the manufacture of our products 
it is not always possible to maintain multiple qualified suppliers for all of our parts  components and subassemblies 
as a result  certain key parts may be available only from a single supplier or a limited number of suppliers 
in addition  suppliers may cease manufacturing certain components that are difficult to replace without significant reengineering of our products 
on occasion  cohu has experienced problems in obtaining adequate and reliable quantities of various parts and components from certain key suppliers 
our results of operations may be materially and adversely impacted if we do not receive sufficient parts to meet our requirements in a timely and cost effective manner 
third parties may violate our proprietary rights or accuse us of infringing upon their proprietary rights 
cohu relies on patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws to establish and maintain proprietary rights in our technology and products 
any of our proprietary rights may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  and these rights may not provide significant competitive advantages 
in addition  from time to time  we receive notices from third parties regarding patent or copyright claims 
any such claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming to defend  result in costly litigation  divert management s attention and resources and cause cohu to incur significant expenses 
in the event of a successful claim of infringement against cohu and our failure or inability to license the infringed technology or to substitute similar non infringing technology  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
a majority of our revenues are generated from exports to foreign countries  primarily in asia  that are subject to economic and political instability and we compete against a number of asian test handling equipment suppliers 
during the year ended december   of our total net sales were exported to foreign countries  including of the sales in the semiconductor equipment segment 
the majority of our export sales are made to destinations in asia 
political or economic instability  particularly in asia  may adversely impact the demand for capital equipment  including equipment of the type manufactured and marketed by cohu 
in addition  we face intense competition from a number of asian suppliers that have certain advantages over us suppliers  including cohu 
these advantages include  among other things  proximity to customers  favorable tariffs and affiliation with significantly larger organizations 
in addition  changes in the amount or price of semiconductors produced in asia could impact the profitability or capital equipment spending programs of our foreign and domestic customers 

table of contents the loss of key personnel could adversely impact our business 
certain key personnel are critical to our business 
our future operating results depend substantially upon the continued service of our key personnel  many of whom are not bound by employment or non competition agreements 
our future operating results also depend in significant part upon our ability to attract and retain qualified management  manufacturing  technical  engineering  marketing  sales and support personnel 
competition for qualified personnel  particularly those with technical skills  is intense  and we cannot ensure success in attracting or retaining qualified personnel 
there may be only a limited number of persons with the requisite skills and relevant industry experience to serve in these positions and it may be increasingly difficult for us to hire personnel over time 
our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the loss of any of our key employees  by the failure of any key employee to perform in his or her current position  or by our inability to attract and retain skilled employees 
our non semiconductor equipment businesses have experienced little or no growth and are not profitable 
we develop  manufacture and sell products used in closed circuit television  metal detection and microwave communications applications 
these products are sold in highly competitive markets and many competitors are segments of large  diversified companies with substantially greater financial  engineering  marketing  manufacturing and customer support capabilities than cohu 
in addition  there are smaller companies that provide or may provide innovative technology incorporated in products that may compete favorably against those of cohu 
we have seen a significant decline in the operating results of these businesses over the last several years with increasing losses and the future prospects for certain of these businesses remain uncertain 
we may not be able to continue to compete successfully in these businesses 
new accounting rules may impact our future operating results 
in december   the staff of the securities and exchange commission issued sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
cohu adopted sab in the fourth quarter of  and  as required  changed its method of revenue recognition in certain instances 
as a result of this change  a cumulative effect adjustment was recorded in cohu s statement of income for the quarter ended march  further changes in revenue recognition practices resulting from initiatives by the fasb are possible 
in addition  the fasb recently advocated changing the accounting for stock based compensation requiring the recognition of compensation expense 
such changes could result in additional adjustments to our results of operations that may be reflected in future prior periods 
we have experienced significant volatility in our stock price 
a variety of factors may cause the price of our stock to be volatile 
in recent years  the stock market in general  and the market for shares of high technology companies in particular  including ours  have experienced extreme price fluctuations  which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies 
during the last three years the price of our common stock has ranged from to 
the price of our stock may be more volatile than other companies due to  among other factors  the unpredictable and cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry  our significant customer concentration  intense competition in the ic test handler industry  our limited backlog making earnings predictability difficult and our relatively low daily stock trading volume 
the market price of our common stock is likely to continue to fluctuate significantly in the future  including fluctuations related and unrelated to our performance 
recently enacted and proposed changes in securities laws and regulations are likely to increase our costs 
the sarbanes oxley act of sox that became law in july   requires changes in some of our corporate governance and securities disclosure or compliance practices 
sox also requires the sec to promulgate new rules on a variety of subjects  in addition to rule proposals already made  and nasdaq has issued revisions to its requirements for companies that are nasdaq listed 
in june  the sec adopted certain rules as directed by section of sox 
these rules require that publicly held companies  including cohu  include in their annual report to shareholders a report of management on the company s internal control over financial reporting 
our independent auditors will be required to attest to management s assessment of internal controls over financial reporting 
cohu will be required to comply with this new requirement in its annual report for the 
table of contents year ending december  if our financial reporting controls are not deemed effective  there will be an adverse impact on our reputation that could negatively impact our business 
we also expect these developments to increase our legal and accounting compliance costs  and to make some activities more difficult  such as stockholder approval of new stock option plans 
we also expect these developments to make it more difficult and expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance  and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage 
these developments could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors  or qualified executive officers 
we are presently evaluating and monitoring regulatory developments and cannot estimate the timing or magnitude of additional costs we may incur as a result 
the outbreak of sars and bird flu in asia and geopolitical instability caused by terrorist attacks and threats may adversely impact our operations and sales 
our asian sales and service headquarters is located in singapore and the majority of our sales are made to destinations in asia 
in addition  we recently organized a business in the philippines to fabricate certain component parts used in our semiconductor test handlers 
our operations and sales in this region may be adversely impacted by severe acute respiratory syndrome  or sars  or the recent outbreak of asian bird flu  if our business or the businesses of our customers are disrupted by travel restrictions or the illness and quarantine of employees 
furthermore  continued terrorist attacks or threats may cause increased geopolitical instability that may have an adverse effect on the world economy and our business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
at december   our investment portfolio includes fixed income securities with a fair value of approximately million 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase 
due to the relatively short duration of our investment portfolio  an immediate ten percent change in interest rates eg to would have no material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
foreign currency exchange risk 
we generally conduct business  including sales to foreign customers  in us dollars and as a result we have limited foreign currency exchange rate risk 
monetary assets and liabilities of cohu s foreign operations are not significant 
the effect of an immediate ten percent change in foreign exchange rates would not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations
