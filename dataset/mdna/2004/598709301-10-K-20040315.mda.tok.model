item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary company overview milacron is a year old company  headquartered in cincinnati  ohio  and focused primarily on manufacturing and selling plastics processing equipment and supplies 
we also manufacture and sell industrial 
table of contents fluids for metalworking applications 
we operate both businesses on a global basis 
with  employees  we have major manufacturing facilities in the united states  germany  italy  belgium and india  and we maintain sales and service offices in over countries around the world 
we operate in four business segments machinery technologies north america  machinery technologies europe  mold technologies and industrial fluids 
our machinery technologies segments manufacture and sell plastics processing equipment  including the three most common types injection molding  blow molding and extrusion machinery  as well as related tooling  parts and services throughout the world 
our mold technologies segment is the leading north american and a leading global supplier of mold bases and components used in the plastics injection molding process 
our industrial fluids segment blends and sells metalworking fluids globally for machining  stamping  grinding and cleaning applications 
milacron has served the plastics processing industries since the late s 
major customers for our plastics technologies are manufacturers of packaging  autos  building materials  industrial components  consumer goods  appliances and housewares  medical devices  and electrical products 
the automotive industry is by far the largest customer of our industrial fluids  followed by makers of industrial components and machinery  off road equipment  appliances and housewares  and aircraft 
we have made and sold industrial fluids since the late s 
plastics markets background and recent history global consumption of plastics has grown steadily since the second world war  as plastics and plastic composites continue to replace traditional materials such as metal  wood  glass and paper in an increasing number of manufactured products  particularly in the packaging  automotive  building materials  consumer goods  housewares  electrical and medical industries 
from to  global consumption of plastics grew at a compounded annual growth rate of  compared with for steel and for aluminum source basf ag  association of plastics manufacturers in europe  international iron steel institute  us geological survey 
plastic part production  like industrial production in general  has historically shown solid  mildly cyclical growth 
in every year from to  plastic part production in the us showed positive year over year increases  averaging compound annual growth source us federal reserve board 
the increases in plastics consumption and corresponding plastic part production have historically created cyclical but growing demand for our plastics machinery and related supplies 
in fact  between and  our sales of plastics equipment and supplies in north america grew at compounded annually excluding acquisitions or including acquisitions 
in the s  like many other us companies  milacron benefited from a strong  growing economy 
our plastics technologies sales were approaching billion with good profitability 
in  for example  on sales of million  our plastics technologies businesses generated over million in ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization and approximately million in ebit 
however  beginning in late through the third quarter of  the us manufacturing sector experienced the most severe and prolonged downturn since the s 
us industrial production  a key indicator of demand for our products  fell from june  to june   a much steeper and longer decline than in the prior downturn from june  to march  source us federal reserve board 
the plastics processing portion of the manufacturing sector was very severely impacted 
as plastic part production slowed  capacity utilization rates of our customers  us plastics processors  dropped from the previous peak of to a low of source us federal reserve board  and shipments of injection molding machines in north america fell over from a peak billion month moving total in to under million by the end of and through source the society of plastics industry 
during this deep recession in north america  with both european and asian markets also in decline  albeit more modestly  demand for many of our plastics machinery lines declined by to or more  and our total global plastics technologies sales fell 
despite a series of responsive actions  including a number 
table of contents of plant closings  head count reductions and a lowering of fixed costs by over million annually  the sales volume declines resulted in three loss years in  and manufacturing in north america started to recover in the fourth quarter of when total us manufacturing orders finally returned to their previous peak levels of and in january  the institute for supply management s manufacturing index  traditionally a very strong leading indicator  rose to its highest level in twenty years 
in the plastics sector  us processors capacity utilization reached for the first time since late historically  our experience has been that demand for machinery begins to grow two or three quarters after a pickup in production  when capacity utilization rates exceed 
in short  our customers need to return to sustained profitability before they can afford to significantly increase their investment in new equipment 
so  while demand for our plastics machinery remained at depressed levels through the end of  we are encouraged by recent economic developments and expect to benefit from a recovery in our plastics technologies businesses over time 
industrial fluids background and recent history during the manufacturing recession of  overall demand for our metalworking fluids declined by about  as our largest customer group  automakers  maintained reasonably good levels of production both in north america and worldwide 
profitability in this business  though impacted by lower sales volumes  held up fairly well throughout the recession  with earnings before interest and taxes in the range of to of sales 
consolidated results sales and new orders in were approximately even with those of after excluding currency translation effects  as the manufacturing recession continued in north america through the first three quarters of the year 
our net loss in was million and included two non cash charges a million charge for goodwill impairment and a million tax provision to establish valuation allowances against a portion of our deferred tax credits as well as million in restructuring costs 
opportunities and challenges entering there are many positive developments bolstering milacron s prospects for improved operating results as well as a number of challenges and risks 
in the fourth quarter of there was a noticeable pickup in industrial production in general and in the plastics processing industries in particular  a sign that an economic recovery in north america might be taking hold 
the economic outlook for europe appears positive and the asian markets are projected to show continued strong growth  especially in china  where we are working hard to expand our presence 
while we expect a pickup in our machinery businesses to lag the overall recovery by two quarters or more  our non machinery businesses currently representing over of total sales  should benefit more immediately 
we believe we are well positioned to expand our share in the higher margin after market sales and services sectors of the business 
internally we continue to implement lean manufacturing techniques and other efficiency measures to improve our profitability and cash flow 
finally  the weakening of the us dollar and the strengthening of the euro in should be competitively advantageous to our us built products in the long run 
although we ended the year with million of cash  the biggest challenge we faced going into was the refinancing of our debt  as our revolving credit agreement and our receivables securitization program were both due to expire and million of senior unsecured notes were due to mature all in the first quarter 
however  on march   we entered into two new financing arrangements that enabled us to repay these obligations by their scheduled maturity dates 
these refinancing arrangements are discussed in depth on pages through of this form k and in notes to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents the biggest risk we still face is the possibility of a stall or setback in the economic recovery of the manufacturing sector in north america  perhaps as a result of geopolitical instability and or rising energy prices 
acquisitions as described more fully in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  in the years through milacron completed a total of five acquisitions of smaller companies that are now included in its plastics technologies segments 
the most significant were the acquisitions of reform flachstahl reform and eoc normalien eoc  two businesses headquartered in germany that manufacture and distribute mold bases and components for injection molding 
in the aggregate  the five newly acquired businesses had annual sales of approximately million as of the respective acquisition dates 
in  we also purchased the remaining of the shares of a consolidated subsidiary in canada that also manufactures mold bases and components 
presence outside the us beginning with the acquisition of ferromatik in  milacron has significantly expanded its presence outside the us and become more globally balanced 
for  markets outside the us represented the following percentages of our consolidated sales europe  canada and mexico  asia  and the rest of the world 
as a result of this geographic mix  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations affect the translation of our sales and earnings  as well as consolidated shareholders equity 
during  the weighted average exchange rate of the euro was stronger in relation to the us dollar than in as a result  milacron experienced favorable currency translation effects on new orders and sales of million and million  respectively 
the effect on earnings was not material 
between december  and december   the euro strengthened against the dollar by approximately which caused the majority of a million favorable adjustment to consolidated shareholders equity 
if the euro should weaken against the us dollar in future periods  we could experience a negative effect in translating our european new orders  sales and earnings when compared to historical results 
significant accounting policies and judgments the consolidated financial statements discussed herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts that are included therein 
the following is a summary of certain accounting policies  estimates and judgmental matters that management believes are significant to milacron s reported financial position and results of operations 
additional accounting policies are described in the note captioned summary of significant accounting policies on pages through of this form k  which should be read in connection with the discussion that follows 
management regularly reviews its estimates and judgments and the assumptions regarding future events and economic conditions that serve as their basis 
while management believes that the estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are reasonable in the circumstances  the recorded amounts could vary under different conditions or assumptions 
deferred tax assets and valuation allowances at december   milacron had significant deferred tax assets related to us and us net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and to charges that have been deducted for financial reporting purposes but which are not yet deductible for income tax reporting 
these charges include the write down of goodwill and a charge to equity related to minimum pension funding 
at december   we have 
table of contents provided valuation allowances against some of the deferred tax assets 
valuation allowances serve to reduce the recorded deferred tax assets to amounts reasonably expected to be realized in the future 
the establishment of valuation allowances and their subsequent adjustment requires a significant amount of judgment because expectations as to the realization of deferred tax assets particularly those assets related to net operating loss carryforwards are generally contingent on the generation of taxable income  the reversal of deferred tax liabilities in the future and the availability of qualified tax planning strategies 
in determining the need for valuation allowances  management considers its short term and long range internal operating plans  which are based on the current economic conditions in the countries in which milacron operates  and the effect of potential economic changes on the company s various operations 
at december   milacron had non us net operating loss carryforwards principally in the netherlands  germany and italy totaling million and related deferred tax assets of million 
valuation allowances totaling million had been provided with respect to these assets as of that date 
management believes that it is more likely than not that portions of the net operating loss carryforwards in these jurisdictions will be utilized 
however  there is currently insufficient positive evidence in some non us jurisdictions primarily germany and italy to conclude that no valuation allowances are required 
at december   milacron had a us federal net operating loss carryforward of million  of which million and million expire in and  respectively 
deferred tax assets related to this loss carryforward  as well as to federal tax credit carryforwards million and additional state and local loss carryforwards million  totaled million 
additional deferred tax assets totaling approximately million had also been provided for book deductions not currently deductible for tax purposes including the writedown of goodwill  postretirement health care benefit costs and accrued pension liabilities 
the deductions for financial reporting purposes are expected to be deducted for income tax purposes in future periods  at which time they will have the effect of decreasing taxable income or increasing the net operating loss carryforward 
the latter will have the effect of extending its ultimate expiration beyond the transaction entered into with glencore finance ag and mizuho international plc on march  could substantially delay the timing of the utilization of certain of the us loss carryforwards and other tax attributes that are discussed in the preceding paragraph in future years see liquidity and sources of capital refinancing actions on page 
at december   no valuation allowances had been provided with respect to the us deferred tax assets based on a more likely than not assessment of whether they would be realized 
this decision was based on the availability of qualified tax planning strategies and the expectation of increased industrial production and capital spending in the us plastics industry 
the higher sales and order levels expected in and beyond  combined with the significant reductions in milacron s cost structure that had been achieved in recent years  were expected to result in improved operating results in relation to the losses incurred in and at june   however  management concluded that a recovery in the plastics industry and the company s return to profitability in the us would be delayed longer than originally expected 
as a result of these delays and the incremental costs of the restructuring initiatives announced in the third quarter of  the company expected to incur a cumulative operating loss in the us for the three year period ending december  in such situations  accounting principles generally accepted in the us include a presumption that expectations of earnings in the future cannot be considered in assessing the need for valuation allowances 
accordingly  a charge to the tax provision of approximately million was recorded in the second quarter of to establish valuation allowances with respect to a portion of the company s us deferred tax assets for which future income was previously assumed 
during the second half of  we increased us deferred tax assets by approximately million due to continued losses from operations and a goodwill impairment charge  the effects of which were partially offset by taxable income related to dividends from non us subsidiaries 
valuation allowances were also increased by million and as a result  there was no tax benefit for financial reporting purposes associated 
table of contents with the losses and the impairment charge 
as of december   us deferred tax assets net of deferred tax liabilities totaled million and us valuation allowances totaled million 
we continue to rely on the availability of qualified tax planning strategies and tax carryforwards to conclude that valuation allowances are not required with respect to us deferred tax assets totaling approximately million at december  management will reassess its conclusions regarding the amount of valuation allowances that are required on a quarterly basis 
further delays in a recovery in the us  particularly in capital spending in the plastics industry  could result in changes in management s estimates and the related assumptions and a requirement to record additional valuation allowances against the us deferred tax assets 
this could result in a further increase in income tax expense and a corresponding decrease in shareholders equity in the period of the change 
accounts receivable  inventory and warranty reserves milacron s internal accounting policies require that each of its operations maintain appropriate reserves for uncollectible receivables  inventory obsolescence and warranty costs in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
because of the diversity of milacron s customers and product lines  the specific procedures used to calculate these reserves vary by location but in all cases must conform to company guidelines 
reserves are required to be reviewed and adjusted as necessary on a quarterly basis 
allowances for doubtful accounts are generally established using specific percentages of the gross receivable amounts based on their age as of a particular balance sheet date 
the amounts calculated through this process are then adjusted for known credit risks and collection problems 
write offs of accounts receivable for milacron s continuing operations have averaged million during the last three years 
while management believes that the company s reserves for doubtful accounts are reasonable in the circumstances  adverse changes in general economic conditions or in the financial condition of milacron s major customers could result in the need for additional reserves in the future 
reserves for inventory obsolescence are generally calculated by applying specific percentages to inventory carrying values based on the level of usage and sales in recent years 
these calculations are then adjusted based on current economic trends  expected product line changes  changes in customer requirements and other factors 
in  milacron s continuing operations recorded new inventory obsolescence reserves totaling million and utilized million of such reserves in connection with the disposal of obsolete inventory 
management believes that milacron s reserves are appropriate in light of its historical results and its assumptions regarding the future 
however  adverse economic changes or changes in customer requirements could necessitate the recording of additional reserves through charges to earnings in the future 
milacron s warranty reserves are of two types normal and extraordinary 
normal warranty reserves are intended to cover routine costs associated with the repair or replacement of products sold in the ordinary course of business during the warranty period 
these reserves are accrued using a percentage of sales approach based on the ratio of actual warranty costs over a representative number of years to sales revenues from products sold with warranties over the same period 
the percentages are required to be reviewed and adjusted as necessary at least annually 
extraordinary warranty reserves are intended to cover major problems related to a single machine or customer order or to problems related to a large number of machines or other type of product 
these reserves are intended to cover the estimated costs of resolving the problems based on all relevant facts and circumstances 
in recent years  costs related to extraordinary warranty problems have not been significant 
in  milacron s continuing operations accrued warranty reserves totaling million and incurred warranty related costs totaling million 
while management believes that the company s warranty reserves are adequate in the circumstances  unforeseen problems related to unexpired warranty obligations could result in a requirement for additional reserves in the future 

table of contents impairment of goodwill and long lived assets in years prior to  milacron reviewed the carrying value of goodwill annually using estimated undiscounted future cash flows 
using this approach in  the maximum period of time to recover the carrying value of recorded goodwill through undiscounted cash flows was determined to be approximately years and the weighted average recovery period was approximately of the average remaining amortization period 
however  effective january  milacron adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
 which requires that goodwill be tested for impairment using probability weighted cash flows discounted at market interest rates 
the change from undiscounted to discounted cash flows resulted in a pretax goodwill impairment charge of million million after tax that was recorded as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting method as of january  sfas no 
requires that goodwill be tested for impairment annually or whenever certain indicators of impairment are determined to be present 
milacron conducted its first annual review of goodwill balances as of october  this review resulted in a pretax goodwill impairment charge related to the mold technologies segment of million with no tax benefit that was recorded in the fourth quarter 
in the third quarter of  we tested the goodwill of two businesses included in the mold technologies segment for impairment due to the presence of certain indicators of impairment 
this review resulted in a preliminary goodwill impairment charge of million that was recorded in the third quarter and subsequently adjusted to million in the fourth quarter after the completion of the independent appraisals of certain tangible and intangible assets that are required to determine their fair values 
the charge resulted from a downward adjustment of the future cash flows expected to be generated by the businesses due to a delay in the general economic recovery in both north america and europe 
the largest decrease in cash flow expectations related to our european mold base and components business due to continued weakness in the markets it serves 
our annual review of goodwill impairment as of october  did not result in additional impairment charges 
milacron currently reviews the carrying values of its long lived assets other than goodwill annually 
these reviews are conducted by comparing the estimates of undiscounted future cash flows that are included in milacron s long range internal operating plans to the carrying values of the related assets 
no growth in operating cash flows beyond the third year is assumed 
under this methodology  impairment would be deemed to exist if the carrying values exceeded the expected future cash flow amounts 
in  milacron reviewed the aggregate carrying values of selected groups of its long lived assets under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the assets included in these reviews consisted principally of property  plant and equipment and  where applicable  intangible assets other than goodwill 
based on these reviews  it was determined that the maximum period of time to recover the carrying values of the tested groups of assets through undiscounted cash flows is approximately years and that the weighted average recovery period is approximately of the remaining average lives of the assets 
based on the results of the reviews  no impairment charges were recorded in insurance reserves through its wholly owned insurance subsidiary  milacron assurance ltd 
mal  milacron is primarily self insured for many types of risks  including general liability  product liability  environmental claims and worker s compensation for certain domestic employees 
mal  which is incorporated in bermuda and is subject to the insurance laws and regulations of that jurisdiction  establishes reserves commensurate with known or estimated exposures under the policies it issues to milacron 
exposure for general and product liability claims is supplemented by reinsurance coverage in some cases and by excess liability coverage in all policy years 
worker s compensation claims in excess of certain limits are insured with commercial carriers 
at december   mal had reserves for known claims and incurred but not reported claims under all 
table of contents coverages totaling approximately million 
the majority of this amount is included in long term accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at that date 
mal s reserves are established based on known claims  including those arising from litigation  and management s best estimates of the ultimate exposures thereunder after consideration of excess carriers liabilities and on estimates of the cost of incurred but not reported claims 
for certain types of exposures  mal and the company utilize actuarially calculated estimates prepared by outside consultants to ensure the adequacy of the reserves 
reserves are reviewed and adjusted quarterly based on all evidence available as of the respective balance sheet dates 
while the ultimate amount of mal s exposure to claims is dependent on future events that cannot be predicted with certainty  management believes that the recorded reserves are adequate in the circumstances 
however  claims in excess of the recorded amounts could adversely affect earnings in the future when additional information becomes available 
pensions milacron maintains defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans that provide retirement benefits to substantially all us employees and certain non us employees 
the most significant of these plans is the principal defined benefit plan for certain us employees  which is also the only defined benefit plan that is funded 
excluding charges of million for temporary supplemental retirement benefits that were offered in connection with restructuring actions  milacron recorded pension income of million related to this plan in in  however  pension income decreased to 
million  once again excluding charges for supplemental benefits of million 
moreover  we currently expect to record pension expense related to this plan of to million in pension expense for and beyond is dependent on a number of factors including returns on plan assets and changes in the plan s discount rate and therefore cannot be predicted with certainty at this time 
the following paragraphs discuss the significant factors that affect the amount of recorded pension income or expense and the reasons for the reductions in income identified above 
a significant factor in determining the amount of income recorded for the funded us plan is the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
in and in several preceding years  milacron used an expected long term rate of return of 
however  the company began using a rate of return of beginning in and will continue to do so in we develop the long term rate of return assumption based on the current mix of equity and debt securities included in the plan s assets and on the historical returns on those types of investments  judgmentally adjusted to reflect current expectations of future returns 
in evaluating future returns on equity securities  the existing portfolio is stratified to separately consider large and small capitalization investments  as well as international securities 
the change from the rate of return assumption to the lower rate had the effect of reducing the amount of pension income that would otherwise be reportable in by more than million 
in determining the amount of pension income or expense to be recognized  the expected long term rate of return is applied to a calculated value of plan assets that recognizes changes in fair value over a three year period 
this practice is intended to reduce year to year volatility in recorded pension income or expense but it can have the effect of delaying the recognition of differences between actual returns on assets and expected returns based on the long term rate of return assumption 
at december   the market value of milacron s pension assets was million whereas the calculated value of these assets was million 
the difference arises because the latter amount includes two thirds of the asset related loss incurred in but only one third of the gain realized in if significant asset related losses are incurred in  it will have the effect of increasing the amount of pension expense to be recognized in future years beginning in in addition to the expected rate of return on plan assets  recorded pension income or expense includes the effects of service cost the actuarial cost of benefits earned during a period and interest on the plan s liabilities to participants 
these amounts are determined actuarially based on current discount rates and assumptions regarding matters such as future salary increases and mortality 
differences in actual experience in relation to these assumptions are generally not recognized immediately but rather are deferred together with asset related gains or losses 
when cumulative asset related and liability related gains or losses exceed the 
table of contents greater of of total liabilities or the calculated value of plan assets  the excess is amortized and included in pension income or expense 
at december   the discount rate used to value the liabilities of the principal us plan was reduced from to 
the rate was further lowered to at december  and to at december  the combined effects of these changes and the variances in relation to the long term rate of return assumption discussed above have resulted in cumulative losses in excess of the corridor 
amortization of these losses adversely affected pension expense in by almost million 
expense for amortization of previously unrecognized losses is expected to be in excess of million in additional changes in the key assumptions discussed above would affect the amount of pension expense currently expected to be recorded for years subsequent to specifically  a one half percent increase in the rate of return on assets assumption would have the effect of decreasing pension expense by approximately million 
a comparable decrease in this assumption would have the opposite effect 
in addition  a one quarter percent increase or decrease in the discount rate would decrease or increase expense by approximately 
million 
because of the significant decrease in the value of the assets of the funded plan for us employees during and and decreases in the plan s discount rate  milacron recorded a minimum pension liability adjustment of million effective december  and significantly reduced the carrying value of the pension asset related to the plan 
this resulted in a million after tax reduction in shareholders equity 
at december   shareholders equity was increased by million with no tax effect due to an increase in plan assets in that was partially offset by an increase in liabilities that resulted from a lower discount rate 
these adjustments were recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss and therefore did not affect reported earnings or loss 
however  they resulted in and million after tax reductions of shareholders equity at december  and december   respectively 
results of operations in an effort to help readers better understand the composition of milacron s operating results  certain of the discussions that follow include references to restructuring costs 
accordingly  those discussions should be read in connection with i the tables on pages and of this form k under the caption comparative operating results and ii the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto that are included herein on pages through discontinued operations as discussed more fully in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  in the third quarter of milacron completed the sales of its valenite  widia and werk metalcutting tools businesses and began to explore strategic alternatives for the sale of its round metalcutting tools and grinding wheels businesses 
the round metalcutting tools business was sold in two separate transactions in the third quarter of and the grinding wheels business is expected to be sold early in all of these businesses are reported as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements 
the comparisons of results of operations that follow exclude these businesses and relate solely to milacron s continuing operations unless otherwise indicated 
pension income and expense in and prior years  milacron recorded significant amounts of income related to its defined benefit pension plan for certain us employees 
for all of  results of continuing operations included income of million related to this plan 
however  because of a significant decrease in the value of the plan s assets and changes in the rate of return on assets and discount rate assumptions see significant accounting policies and judgments pensions  pension income related to continuing operations decreased to 
million in as discussed further below  the fluctuation between years has negatively affected margins  selling and administrative expense and earnings 

table of contents compared to new order and sales consolidated new orders totaled million in compared to million in currency translation effects resulting principally from the strength of the euro in relation to the us dollar contributed substantially all of the million increase 
consolidated sales increased from million in to million in as was the case with new orders  translation effects contributed most of the increase 
order and shipment levels showed improvement in the fourth quarter but continued to be penalized by low levels of industrial production in the us and capital spending in the plastics processing industry 
export orders totaled million in  an increase of million from million in export sales increased from million in to million in both increases related principally to higher export sales of us built blow molding systems 
total sales of all segments to non us markets  including exports  were million  or of consolidated sales  in compared to million  or of sales  in sales of goods manufactured outside the us totaled in compared to in the strength of the euro in relation to the dollar was a significant factor in both increases 
our backlog of unfilled orders was million at december  compared to million at december  the increase reflects higher order levels for blow molding systems in the us and injection molding machinery in europe 
margins  costs and expenses including million of restructuring costs related to product line discontinuation  the consolidated manufacturing margin was in excluding restructuring costs  the consolidated margin was 
in  the consolidated manufacturing margin  including million of restructuring costs  was 
excluding restructuring costs  the margin was 
margins remained low in relation to pre recession historical levels due to reduced sales volume and the related underabsorption of manufacturing costs 
margins were also penalized by increased pricing pressure for plastics processing machinery in both north america and europe and a million decrease from in the amount of pension income included in the cost of products sold 
however  margins benefited from the effects of our process improvement initiatives and our recent restructuring actions 
total selling and administrative expense was million in compared to million in selling expense increased from million  or of sales  in to million  or of sales  in due principally to variable selling costs associated with higher sales volume  increased bad debt expense and a million reduction in pension income 
costs associated with the triennial national plastics exposition that was held in june of and currency effects also contributed to the increase in selling expense 
conversely  administrative expense decreased by more than million due principally to the effects of our restructuring actions and cost containment efforts despite almost million in adverse currency effects 
other expense net increased from income of million in to expense of million in the amount for includes income of million from the settlement of warranty claims against a supplier and 
million of income from the licensing of patented technology 
the amount includes income of million from technology licensing 
restructuring costs as discussed more fully in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  in and we announced additional restructuring initiatives intended to further reduce our cost structure as well as to improve operating efficiency and customer service 
in the aggregate  these actions will ultimately result in the elimination of approximately positions worldwide 
cost savings related to these actions were in excess of million in on an annualized basis  the savings are expected to be in excess of million in 
table of contents and beyond 
this is in addition to the savings we realized from the restructuring actions that were initiated in in the fourth quarter of  we initiated the transfer of all manufacture of container blow molding machines and structural foam systems from the plant in manchester  michigan to our facility near cincinnati  ohio 
the mold making operation in manchester will also be moved to a smaller  more cost effective location near the present facility early in in another action  the manufacture of special mold bases for injection molding at the monterey park  california plant was discontinued and transferred to other facilities in north america 
early in  we initiated a plan for the further restructuring of our european blow molding machinery operations  including the discontinuation of the manufacture of certain product lines at the magenta  italy plant 
in the second quarter of  we initiated a plan to close the special mold base machining operation in mahlberg  germany and relocate a portion of its manufacturing to another facility 
certain other production is being outsourced 
in the third quarter of  we began to implement additional restructuring initiatives that focus on further overhead cost reductions in each of milacron s plastics technologies segments and at the corporate office 
these actions involve the relocation of production  closure of sales offices  voluntary early retirement programs and general overhead reductions 
in and  restructuring costs also include amounts for the integration of eoc and reform  two businesses acquired in  with milacron s existing mold base and components business in europe and costs associated with initiatives announced in and to consolidate manufacturing operations and reduce milacron s cost structure

table of contents goodwill impairment charge in  milacron recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million with no tax benefit to adjust the carrying value of the goodwill of two businesses included in the mold technologies segment 
the charge was calculated by discounting estimated future cash flows and resulted from a downward adjustment of the cash flows expected to be generated by these businesses due to the delay in the general economic recovery in both north america and europe 
the largest decrease in cash flow expectations related to our european mold base and components business due to continued weakness in the markets it serves 
results by segment the following sections discuss the operating results of our business segments which are presented in tabular form on pages though of this form k 
as presented therein  segment operating profit or loss excludes restructuring costs and goodwill impairment charges 
machinery technologies north america new orders in the machinery technologies north america segment were million compared to million in the segment s sales also increased modestly from million in to million in despite signs of increased capacity utilization in us plastics processing industries in the fourth quarter  orders and shipments remained at low levels for the third consecutive year due to depressed capital spending by our customers 
in addition  the segment s results were penalized by weaker price realization and reduced pension income but benefited from our restructuring and cost reduction initiatives 
excluding restructuring costs  the segment had operating earnings of million in compared to million in the decrease was due entirely to a million reduction in pension income and the absence of million of royalty income from the licensing of patented technology that was received in restructuring costs for the segment were million in and million in in both years  most of these costs related to the relocation of the north american blow molding systems business and to supplemental retirement benefits offered for the purpose of reducing the cost structure of the segment s injection molding and extrusion machinery businesses 
the restructuring actions initiated in and resulted in cost savings in excess of million in and are expected to produce savings of almost million in including the actions that began in  the segment s savings in are expected to be almost million 
machinery technologies europe the machinery technologies europe segment had new orders of million and sales of million in compared to orders of million and sales of million in currency translation effects related to the strength of the euro in relation to the dollar contributed about two thirds of both increases 
sales of blow molding systems were flat in relation to but orders and shipments of european built injection molding machines increased as measured in local currency despite weaker price realization 
the segment s operating results improved significantly as a result of our recent restructuring of its blow molding systems business as its loss excluding restructuring costs decreased from million in to million in restructuring costs totaled million in and related principally to the restructuring of the blow molding business and the discontinuation of certain of its product lines and to overhead reductions in the segment s injection molding machinery business 
to date  these actions have resulted in savings in excess of million but are expected to result in savings in excess of million in including the benefits of additional actions that began in  the segment s total savings in are expected to be approximately million

the segment s profitability was adversely affected by low levels of industrial production and capacity utilization in both north america and europe 
inefficiencies associated with the consolidation of the segment s european operations continued into and adversely affected its results as did reduced profitability in north america 
excluding restructuring costs  the segment had operating earnings of million in compared to earnings of million in restructuring costs totaled million in and related principally to overhead reductions in north america and to the further consolidation of the segment s european operations 
the actions in europe included the closure of two

income taxes as was previously discussed see significant accounting policies and judgments deferred tax assets and valuation allowances  we recorded a million charge in the second quarter tax provision to establish valuation allowances against a portion of the company s us deferred tax assets 
additional deferred tax assets and valuation allowances were recorded in the second half of the year 
due to the geographic mix of earnings and losses  the tax provision for also includes income tax expense related to profitable operations in non us jurisdictions 
these factors resulted in a provision for income taxes of million despite a pretax loss of million 
in  we recorded tax benefits related to losses in the us at the federal statutory rate 
we also had a favorable tax rate for non us operations due in part to permanent deductions in the netherlands  the benefits of which were partially offset by increases in valuation allowances in germany and italy

the decreases occurred despite favorable currency effects and the contributions of the acquisitions 
as was the case for much of  low levels of industrial production and capital spending in the plastics processing industry penalized results in however  order levels and shipments increased modestly in the fourth quarter 
export orders totaled million in compared to million in while export sales decreased from million to million 
in both cases  the decreases resulted from reduced export volume for plastics processing machinery 
sales of all segments to non us customers  including exports  totaled million  or of sales  in compared to million  or of sales  in sales of products manufactured outside the us were million in and million in milacron s backlog of unfilled orders was million at december  and million at december  the increase resulted principally from higher fourth quarter order levels for plastics processing machinery worldwide

excluding these costs  margins were in and in despite our aggressive cost reduction efforts  lower order and sales volume and reduced manufacturing cost absorption continued to depress the margins of certain segments as described below

as a percentage of sales  selling expense held steady at 
administrative expense decreased by in relation to other expense net decreased from million in to income of million in the amount for includes million of royalty income from the licensing of patented technology whereas the amount for includes goodwill amortization expense of million and a gain of million on the sale of surplus real estate 

table of contents restructuring costs in response to exceptionally low order levels  in the third and fourth quarters of we implemented plans to consolidate manufacturing operations and further reduce milacron s cost structure 
these plans resulted in pretax charges to earnings from continuing operations of million  including million in and million in in  we also initiated a plan to integrate the operations of eoc and reform  both of which were acquired in the second quarter of that year  with our existing mold base and components business in europe 
the total cost of completing the integration was originally expected to be million but was ultimately increased to million due to unanticipated costs related to the integration and lower than expected realizable values for surplus assets 
of the total cost  million was included in reserves for employee termination benefits and facility exit costs that were established in the allocations of the eoc and reform acquisition costs 
the remainder was charged to expense  including million in and million in in connection with the plans initiated in  milacron recorded pretax restructuring costs related to continuing operations of million in compared to million in cash costs for the restructuring actions and the integration of eoc and reform were million in in the aggregate  the actions initiated in are generating over million in annualized cost savings  most of which were realized in in the third quarter of  we approved additional restructuring plans for the purpose of further reducing the company s cost structure in certain businesses and to reduce corporate costs as a result of the dispositions of widia  werk and valenite 
these actions resulted in third quarter restructuring expenses of million 
in november  we announced additional restructuring initiatives intended to improve operating efficiency and customer service 
the first action involved the transfer of all manufacturing of container blow molding machines and structural foam systems from the plant in manchester  michigan to our more modern and efficient facility near cincinnati  ohio 
the mold making operation in manchester will also be moved to a smaller  more cost effective location near the existing facility 
in the second initiative  the manufacture of special mold bases for injection molding at the monterey park  california plant was phased out and transferred to various other facilities in north america 
these additional actions were expected to result in incremental restructuring costs of to million  of which million was charged to expense in with a majority of the remainder to be recorded in the total cash cost of these initiatives was expected to be approximately million  most of which was to be spent in the pretax annualized cost savings were expected to exceed million  most of which was realized in results by segment the following sections discuss the operating results of our business segments which are presented in tabular form on pages through of this form k

despite lower sales volume  the segment s manufacturing margin improved in as a result of our cost reduction and restructuring efforts 
excluding restructuring costs of million  the segment had operating earnings of million in compared to a operating loss of million which excludes million of restructuring costs 
the amount for includes the previously discussed million of royalty income 
goodwill amortization expense included in the amount totaled million 
machinery technologies europe new orders were million in  an increase of million in relation to the prior year that was due principally to favorable currency effects

manufacturing margins also decreased slightly in and the segment s results continued to be penalized by operating problems related to the consolidation of the segment s european blow molding systems business that was completed in the segment had an operating loss of million in compared to a loss of million in the amount for excludes a credit of 
million related to the reversal of excess restructuring reserves that had been accrued in while the loss for excludes restructuring expense of million 
goodwill amortization expense in was million 
mold technologies the mold technologies segment had new orders of million in  a decrease of million in relation to orders of million in sales also decreased by million from million to million 
the decreases were due in part to low levels of industrial production and capacity utilization in the north american plastics industry but order levels and shipments also decreased in the segment s european operations 
due to reduced volume  the segment s manufacturing margin decreased by approximately one percentage point 
excluding restructuring costs of million  the segment had operating earnings of million in compared to earnings of million in which excludes restructuring costs of million 
the margin decrease and reduction in profitability were due principally to costs and inefficiencies related to the integration of eoc and reform see acquisitions with the segment s existing european mold base business 
the amount for includes a fourth quarter goodwill impairment charge of million related to a small business unit in the segment 
goodwill amortization expense in was million 
industrial fluids in the industrial fluids segment  new orders and sales both increased from million in to million in approximately one half of the increases resulted from favorable currency effects 
the segment s manufacturing margin decreased only modestly but its operating profit fell from million  which excludes

the amount for includes goodwill amortization expense of million  million of restructuring costs and the million land sale gain 
income taxes during  milacron recorded a net benefit related to income taxes due to the combined effects of operating losses in the us and a favorable effective tax rate for non us operations 
the losses incurred by our us operations resulted in tax benefits based on the federal statutory rate and the company s effective tax rate for state and local tax purposes  in both cases adjusted for permanent differences and applicable credits 
the favorable tax rate for non us operations was due in part to permanent deductions in the netherlands partially offset by increases in valuation allowances as discussed below in germany and italy 
the consolidated effective tax rate also benefited from the favorable resolution of tax contingencies related to the us and other jurisdictions 
milacron entered both and with significant net operating loss carryforwards in certain jurisdictions along with valuation allowances against the carryforwards and other deferred tax assets 
valuation allowances are evaluated periodically and revised based on a more likely than not assessment of whether the related deferred tax assets will be realized 
increases or decreases in these valuation allowances serve to unfavorably or favorably impact our effective tax rate

these amounts were partially offset by losses on the sale of widia and werk of million and on the planned dispositions of the round metalcutting tools and grinding wheels businesses totaling million 
the latter amount was recorded as a charge to earnings in the fourth quarter 
the amounts for the valenite and the widia and werk transactions were revised in the fourth quarter from the amounts previously recognized to reflect final purchase price adjustments and to adjust reserves and tax effects to reflect more recent estimates of expected liabilities or benefits 
cumulative effect of change in method of accounting effective january   milacron recorded a pretax goodwill impairment charge of million after tax or per share as the cumulative effect of a change in method of accounting in connection with the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no

the company does not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes 
at december   milacron had outstanding forward contracts totaling million compared to million at december  the annual potential loss from a hypothetical adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates would not be material at either date 
interest rate risk at december   milacron s continuing operations had fixed interest rate debt of million  including million of notes due march   and million million of eurobonds due april  we also had floating rate debt totaling million  with interest fluctuating based primarily on changes in libor 
at december   fixed rate debt related to continuing operations totaled million  and floating rate debt totaled million 
we also had the ability to sell up to million of accounts receivable under our receivables purchase agreement which resulted in financing fees that fluctuated based on changes in commercial paper rates 
as a result  annual interest expense and financing fees fluctuated based on changes in short term borrowing rates 
the potential annual loss on floating rate debt from a hypothetical increase in interest rates would be approximately 
million at december   and 
million at december  under the arrangements in effect at those dates 
on march   we entered into two new financing agreements to repay our notes due march   the outstanding debt under our revolving credit facility which was terminated on march   and our obligations under our receivables purchase agreement which was terminated on march  effective as of march   our interest rate risk  including our exposure to floating interest rates  is based on the new financing arrangements 
see liquidity and sources of capital refinancing actions on page 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements sales of accounts receivable as discussed more fully in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  milacron has maintained a receivables purchase agreement with a third party financial institution for the last several years 
under this arrangement we sold  on a revolving basis  an undivided percentage ownership interest in designated pools of accounts receivable 
as existing receivables were collected  undivided interests in new eligible receivables were sold 
accounts that became days past due were no longer eligible to be sold and milacron was at risk for any related credit losses 
credit losses have not been significant in the past and we maintained an allowance for doubtful accounts sufficient to cover our estimated exposures 
at december   approximately million of accounts receivable had been sold under this arrangement which expired on march  the average amount sold during was also approximately million 
on march  this facility was repaid see liquidity and sources of capital refinancing actions on page 
certain of milacron s non us subsidiaries also sell accounts receivable on an ongoing basis for purposes of improving liquidity and cash flows 
some of these sales are made with recourse  in which case appropriate reserves for potential losses are provided 
at december   the gross amount of receivables sold totaled million 
the average amount sold during the year was approximately million 
financing fees related to these arrangements were not material 
sales of notes and guarantees in years prior to  our us operations sold with recourse notes from its customers for the purchase of plastics processing machinery 
in certain other cases  milacron guaranteed the repayment of all or a portion of notes payable from its customers to third party lenders 
these arrangements were entered into for the purpose of facilitating sales of machinery 
new sales of notes and guarantees were not significant in but milacron retains potential obligations under earlier arrangements 
in the event a customer fails to repay a note  we generally regain title to the machinery 
at december   our maximum exposure under these us guarantees  as well as certain guarantees by certain of the company s non us subsidiaries  totaled million 
losses related to sales of notes and guarantees have not been material in the past

the above table excludes the contingent liabilities of up to million related to sales of receivables and loan guarantees that are discussed above 
the above table also excludes contractual obligations arising from the refinancing arrangements entered into on march  discussed below on page under liquidity and sources of capital refinancing actions 
liquidity and sources of capital at december   milacron had cash and cash equivalents of million  a decrease of million from december  approximately million of the decrease resulted from the payment in of post closing adjustments related to the divestitures for valenite and widia and werk which were sold in of the million of cash at december   approximately million was used to collateralize sales of certain non us receivables 
a substantial amount of the cash was held in foreign accounts in support of our non us operations 
were this non us cash to be repatriated  it could result in withholding taxes in foreign jurisdictions 
operating activities provided million of cash in due to reductions in inventories and trade receivables that resulted from our aggressive working capital management initiatives 
cash flows for also benefited from the receipt of million of refunds of income taxes paid in prior years 
these benefits were partially offset by reductions of certain current liabilities 
in  operating activities provided million cash due principally to the results of our working capital management programs 
investing activities used million of cash in  principally for post closing adjustments related to the divestitures and for acquisitions and capital additions 
in  investing activities provided million of cash due to the divestiture proceeds which were offset to some degree by capital expenditures and acquisition related costs 
in  financing activities used million of cash  principally for debt repayments 
in  financing activities used million of cash due to debt repayments using a portion of the divestiture proceeds 
milacron s current ratio related to continuing operations was at december  compared to at december  the change is due principally to the reclassification of million of notes due march  from noncurrent liabilities at december  to current liabilities at december  total shareholders equity was a deficit of million at december  a decrease of million from december  the decrease resulted from the net loss incurred for the year which includes the effects of the million goodwill impairment charge and the million tax provision to establish us valuation allowances 
total debt was million at december  compared to million at december  the increase resulted entirely from currency effects and occurred despite million of debt repayments during the year 

table of contents at december   milacron had lines of credit with various us and non us banks totaling approximately million  including a million committed revolving credit facility 
at december   million of the revolving credit facility was utilized  including outstanding letters of credit of million 
the facility matured on march  the revolving credit facility included a number of financial and other covenants  the most significant of which required milacron to achieve specified minimum levels of four quarter trailing cumulative consolidated ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
at december   milacron was in compliance with all covenants 
on march   all amounts borrowed under the revolving credit facility were repaid see liquidity and sources of capital refinancing actions on page 
in addition to the revolving credit facility  as of december   we had a number of other credit lines totaling million  of which approximately million was available for use under various conditions 
under the terms of the revolving credit facility  increases in debt are primarily limited to current lines of credit and certain other indebtedness from other sources 
milacron s debt and credit are rated by standard poor s s p and moody s investors service moody s 
on february   s p announced it had lowered milacron s corporate credit rating to ccc and its senior unsecured rating to ccc  in both cases with a creditwatch developing outlook 
at the same time  the company s senior secured bank facility was lowered to ccc 
s p s ratings were reaffirmed on march  and the outlook was changed to credit watch negative 
on february   moody s announced that it had lowered milacron s senior unsecured rating to caa and its senior implied rating to caa the senior secured rating was affirmed at b and all ratings were placed on review for possible further downgrade 
we believe the current ratings of moody s and s p reflect uncertainty about our ability to refinance the financial obligations that were due on march and march  see liquidity and sources of capital refinancing actions on page and expect that the ratings will be reconsidered in the near future 
none of the company s debt instruments include rating triggers that would accelerate maturity or increase interest rates in the event of a ratings downgrade 
accordingly  any future rating downgrades would have no significant short term effect  although they could potentially affect the types and cost of credit facilities and debt instruments available to the company in the future 
our accounts receivable purchase program with a third party financial institution has been another important source of liquidity for the last several years 
during the fourth quarter of  the liquidity facility that supports the program was extended from the scheduled expiration date of december  to february  the receivables purchase agreement was also amended to mature at february  on february   the expiration of the liquidity facility and the maturity of the receivables purchase agreement were both extended to march  including million related to discontinued operations  million of the million facility was utilized at december  on march   this facility was repaid see liquidity and sources of capital refinancing actions on page 
milacron expects to generate positive cash flow from operating activities during  which will be partially offset by up to to million for capital expenditures 
assuming that we obtain the shareholder approval described below under liquidity and sources of capital refinancing actions  we believe that milacron s current cash position  cash flow from operations  available credit lines  including the new credit facility entered into on march  described below  will be sufficient to meet the company s operating and capital requirements in if we do not obtain the required shareholder approval on or before july   our liquidity will be materially impaired as described more fully below 

table of contents refinancing actions on march   we entered into a definitive agreement whereby glencore finance ag and mizuho international plc purchased million in aggregate principal amount of milacron s new exchangeable debt securities 
the proceeds from this transaction  together with existing cash balances  were used to repay the notes due march  the securities we issued were million of secured step up series a notes due and million of secured step up series b notes due the million of series a notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of per share and initially bear a combination of cash and pay in kind interest at a total rate of per annum 
the million of series b notes initially bear a combination of cash and pay in kind interest at a total rate of per annum 
both the series a notes and the series b notes are exchangeable for a new series of milacron s convertible preferred stock with a cumulative dividend rate of 
upon receipt of shareholder approval of both i the authorization of additional shares of our common stock and ii the issuance of the new series of convertible preferred stock convertible into such common stock and for which the series a notes and the series b notes may be exchanged  the interest rate applicable to both the series a notes and the series b notes will be retroactively reset to per annum from the date of issuance  payable in cash 
following receipt of shareholder approval  as soon as a condition requiring the execution of a refinancing of the million of eurobonds due in april is satisfied or waived  all series a notes and series b notes and any common stock into which any series a notes had been converted will be exchanged for shares of the new series of convertible preferred stock 
if shareholder approval is not obtained on or before july   the series a notes and series b notes will be in default and will remain outstanding until march  with an initial interest rate of from the date of issuance  increasing to over time  and any common stock into which any series a notes had previously been converted will be exchanged for shares of the company s currently authorized  but unissued  serial preference stock with a cumulative dividend rate 
following exchange of the series a notes and the series b notes for convertible preferred stock  the holders of the convertible preferred stock would collectively own approximately between and of milacron s fully diluted equity on an as converted basis  depending on whether milacron exercises an option to redeem a portion of the convertible preferred stock with the proceeds from a rights offering to its existing shareholders 
after seven years  the convertible preferred stock would automatically be converted into common stock at a conversion price of per share but may be converted prior to that time at the option of the holders 
the conversion price would be subject to reset to per share at the end of the second quarter of if a test based on milacron s financial performance for is not satisfied 
in addition  as part of the transaction we have agreed to issue to holders of the convertible preferred stock contingent warrants to purchase an aggregate of one million shares of our common stock  subject to receiving shareholder approval to increase our authorized common stock  which contingent warrants will be exercisable only if a test based on milacron s financial performance for is not satisfied 
assuming that milacron does not conduct a rights offering to its existing shareholders  and both the conversion price of the convertible preferred stock is reset to and the contingent warrants are exercised  the holders of the convertible preferred stock would own approximately of milacron s fully diluted equity on an as converted basis 
the events contemplated by the agreement with glencore finance ag and mizuho international plc could result in an ownership change of milacron for tax purposes 
were this to occur  the timing of our utilization of tax loss carryforwards and other tax attributes could be substantially delayed 
accordingly  this could affect income tax expense and cash income taxes in future years 
if we do not obtain shareholder approval of both the authorization of additional shares of our common stock and the issuance of the new series of convertible preferred stock convertible into such common stock on or before july   our liquidity will be materially impaired as the series a notes and the series b notes will go into default and the interest rates thereon will become significantly higher 
if shareholder approval has not been obtained on or before july   the interest payable on the series a notes and the series b notes will no longer be eligible for retroactive reset to 
instead  interest on the series a notes and the series b notes will be payable in arrears a on september  in cash at a rate of per annum and in additional series a notes or series b notes  as applicable  at a rate of per annum  b on march  
table of contents in cash at a rate of per annum and in additional series a notes or series b notes  as applicable  at a rate of per annum  c on september  in cash at a rate of per annum and in additional series a notes or series b notes  as applicable  at a rate of per annum  and d on march   and through to maturity on march   in cash at a rate of per annum 
pursuant to the definitive agreement with glencore finance ag and mizuho international plc  milacron has agreed to use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause a number of persons selected by holders of the series a notes  acting together  to be appointed or elected to a number of directorships on milacron s board of directors in proportion to the percentage of milacron s fully diluted equity represented by the number of shares of common stock into which the series a notes may be converted  rounded up to the nearest whole number 
on march   milacron also reached a separate agreement with credit suisse first boston for a million credit facility having a term of approximately one year 
at close  extensions of credit under the facility in an aggregate amount of million were utilized to repay and terminate milacron s existing revolving credit facility and its existing receivables purchase program 
this new credit facility consists of a million revolving a facility  with a million subfacility for letters of credit  and a million term loan b facility 
milacron and certain of its wholly owned domestic subsidiaries are joint and several borrowers under the new credit facility and the entire new credit facility is secured by first priority liens on substantially all assets of milacron and its domestic subsidiaries and includes pledges of stock of various wholly owned domestic subsidiaries and certain foreign subsidiaries 
availability under the revolving a facility is limited by a borrowing base calculated based upon specified percentages of eligible receivables and eligible inventory  a million minimum availability covenant resulting in aggregate availability of no more than million and other reserve requirements 
in addition  the borrowing base is subject to the customary ability of the administrative agent for the lenders to reduce advance rates  impose or change collateral value limitations  establish reserves and declare certain collateral ineligible from time to time in its reasonable discretion  any of which could reduce our borrowing availability under the revolving a facility at any time 
at march   additional availability under the revolving a facility was approximately million  after taking into account the minimum availability and existing reserve requirements 
with the exception of million of domestic cash that may be held by milacron outside the control of the administrative agent  all proceeds of milacron s domestic accounts receivable and other domestic collateral are subject to a daily cash sweep 
under the terms of the new credit facility  these proceeds are deposited in lockbox accounts under the control of the administrative agent and then transferred to blocked accounts under the control of the administrative agent 
each business day  the funds in the blocked accounts will be applied to pay down any outstanding borrowings under the revolving a facility 
as a result  milacron s liquidity is likely to be dependent on its ability to continue to make borrowings under the new credit facility 
if milacron is unable to satisfy the conditions to borrowing under the new credit facility  which include  among other things  conditions related to the continued accuracy of our representations and warranties and the absence of any unmatured or matured defaults  or any material adverse change in our business or financial condition  without a waiver we would lose access to this important source of liquidity and our financial condition would be materially impaired 
milacron has the ability to prepay the revolving a facility  in whole or in part  at any time without penalty 
milacron has the option to prepay the term loan b facility at any time  subject to a prepayment fee on the principal amount prepaid  as follows i in whole  to the extent concurrently therewith or prior thereto all revolving a loans have been repaid in full and all commitments under the revolving a facility have been terminated  or ii in whole or in part  if availability under the revolving a facility exceeds million and no event of default exists 
prepayments of term loan b loans permanently reduce milacron s availability under the new credit facility 
milacron is also required to make prepayments in connection with  among other things  asset sales and casualty events and in connection with the issuance of debt or equity  tax refunds  proceeds from other corporate events and other extraordinary receipts 
additionally  there are limitations placed on the amounts that can be paid to the holders of the eurobonds due april without causing a prepayment event 

table of contents the new credit facility includes a number of affirmative and negative covenants  including  but not limited to  negative covenants limiting the ability of milacron and its subsidiaries to incur additional debt  incur liens  make capital expenditures  issue or sell capital stock and make restricted payments including a prohibition on the ability to make cash interest or dividend payments on debt or equity securities issued pursuant to the terms of the definitive agreement entered into on march  among milacron  mizuho international plc and glencore finance ag  unless availability under the revolving a facility exceeds million before taking into account minimum availability requirements 
the new credit facility also includes a financial covenant that requires the company to achieve specified minimum levels of monthly cumulative ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization adjusted to exclude certain restructuring costs and certain other items  each as specified in the financing agreement 
the new credit facility is subject to various events of default  including an event of default if the company does not obtain shareholder approval of both the authorization of additional shares of its common stock and the issuance of a new series of convertible preferred stock convertible into such common stock on or before july  borrowings under the new credit facility will bear interest  at milacron s option  based upon either i a libor rate plus the applicable margin as defined below or ii a reference rate plus the applicable margin as defined below 
the applicable margin  with respect to revolver a libor loans  is per annum  and with respect to revolver a reference rate loans  is per annum
