item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations has been prepared in accordance with canadian generally accepted accounting principles gaap  and conforms in all material respects to us gaap with the exception of the items discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
forward looking statements statements included in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations which are not historical in nature are intended to be  and are hereby identified as  forward looking statements for purposes of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of canada southern cautions readers that forward looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward looking statements 
among these risks and uncertainties are uncertainties as to the pricing  production levels and costs from properties in which canada southern has interests  and the extent of the recoverable reserves at those properties 
the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events  or otherwise 
the company does caution  however  that results in will be significantly lower than in  which was favorably affected by settlement of the kotaneelee litigation 
executive summary with the settlement of the lengthy and costly litigation  which effectively curtailed any exploration and development activities for the company  the board of directors and management are now able to focus attention on other concerns facing the company 
the company believes that its largest producing asset two wells at the kotaneelee field in terms of production volumes  cash flow  revenues  and earnings is nearing the end of its economic life 
while management is optimistic that further drilling of this field could occur  the timing and extent of future development is under the control of a third party operator 
while the working interest partners exercise operational control over this field s development  company management has been in the process of identifying additional opportunities for growth and has commenced limited capital expenditures to achieve that goal 
recently issued statements of financial accounting standards effective january   the company will adopt the new accounting guideline acg on full cost accounting for the oil and gas industry as published by the canadian institute of chartered accountants 
the primary effect of this change in accounting policy will be the use of future expected prices as opposed to year end prices for the purpose of determining potential impairments in the company s oil and gas properties 
the company does not expect the adoption of this accounting guideline to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued statement no 
accounting for asset retirement obligations 
this statement  effective in us gaap for fiscal years beginning on or after june   requires the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of the fair value of a liability can be made 
the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset 
similar standards have been introduced within canadian gaap effective for fiscal the effect of this pronouncement on the financial position of canada southern and the resulting canadian and us gaap differences are recorded in note us gaap differences to the consolidated financial statements 
in august  the fasb issued statement no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment of long lived assets 
statement no 
was effective for the fiscal year and did not have a material impact on canada southern s financial position 
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations the company does not use off balance sheet arrangements such as securitization of receivables with any unconsolidated entities or other parties 
the company does not engage in trading or risk management activities and does not have material transactions involving related parties 
a summary of canada southern s contractual obligations as of december  is provided in the following table payments due by periods s contractual obligations total less than year years years operating leases long term debt other long term liabilities capital leases purchase obligations total critical accounting policies and estimates use of estimates inherent in the preparation of financial statements is the use of estimates and assumptions regarding certain assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
such estimates primarily relate to unsettled transactions and events as of the date of the financial statements 
accordingly actual results may differ from the estimated amounts 
areas that involve the use of significant estimates critical the accounts of canada southern are outlined below 
full cost ceiling test calculations canada southern follows the full cost method of accounting for its oil and gas properties 
the full cost method requires canada southern to calculate  on a quarterly basis  a ceiling test or limitation of the value of properties that can be capitalized on the balance sheet 
the ceiling test is a cost recovery test  that compares the expected future net revenues from the company s oil and gas assets adjusted for certain items with the capitalized or net book value of such assets on the consolidated balance sheet 
if the capitalized costs on the consolidated balance sheet are in excess of the calculated ceiling  the excess must be expensed as additional depletion during the reporting period 
the discounted present value of canada southern s proved natural gas  liquids  and oil reserves is a major component of the ceiling test calculation 
this component inherently contains many subjective judgments  such as projected future production rates  the timing of future expenditures  and the economic productive limit of the company s assets 
canada southern utilizes the resources of a professional independent reserves evaluator  appointed by the board of directors  to evaluate all of its reserves on an annual basis 
the passage of time provides additional qualitative information regarding the company s reserves that could result in reserve revisions or re determinations 
future significant reductions in a property s production or a significant decrease in product pricing could result in a full cost ceiling test writedown 
in addition  significant changes in proven reserves will impact the calculation of depletion 
future site restoration the determination of the amount of future asset retirement obligations  asset retirement costs  reclamation  and other similar activities is subject to the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
such estimates include major items such as the remaining economic reserve life of a property as discussed above  the timing of abandonment  the costs related to the abandonment  and others 
significant changes in any of the assumptions could alter the amount of site restoration 
revenue recognition revenue under carried interest agreements is recorded in the period when the net proceeds become receivable  measurable and collection is reasonably assured 
under the carried interest agreements  canada southern receives oil and natural gas revenues net of operating and capital costs incurred by the working interest participants 
the time the net revenues become receivable and collection is reasonably assured depends on the terms and conditions of the relevant agreements and the practices followed by the operator 
as a result  net revenues may lag the production month by one or more months 
liquidity and capital resources at december   canada southern had approximately  of cash and cash equivalents 
these funds are expected to be used for general corporate purposes and for oil and gas exploration and development activities 
net cash flow provided from operations during was  compared to  during the  increase in net cash provided from operations during is comprised of increase in income from operations net changes in accounts receivable and other net changes in current liabilities net changes in current income taxes payable increase in net cash provided by operations on september  the company announced that it had entered into a settlement agreement with the defendants in the kotaneelee litigation 
the gross monies net of certain costs related to the settlement  see note of the consolidated financial statements as a result of the settlement  were received by the company on october  with the settlement of the kotaneelee litigation  the risk of the court of appeal assessing canada southern with the litigation costs incurred by the defendants was eliminated 
the settlement of the litigation was a one time event that increased the company s cash position  cash flow  revenues  and earnings per share 
investors are cautioned that earnings per share in the future will likely be significantly lower than the per share earned during the year ended december  in connection with the receipt of taxable settlement proceeds the company paid  of cash income tax to the federal and provincial taxation authorities on february  canada southern s current cash flow from oil and gas operations is mainly derived from the kotaneelee field 
net field level receipts from kotaneelee represented approximately of the company s total net field receipts for the year ended december  
the kotaneelee property continues to experience an increase in water production  and an associated decrease in gas production 
there is a possibility that canada southern s cash flow from kotaneelee could either be significantly reduced or terminated at any time in the future 
further development of the kotaneelee field may assist with the recovery of the existing remaining reserves  and as well  identify additional reserves 
however  future development of kotaneelee is highly risky due to the complexity and depth of the producing formation  the costs of drilling  and the possibility of water in the formation 
should a well be drilled at kotaneelee and canada southern has not yet converted to a working interest  then cash flows from the field would be suspended until payout is again achieved 
should canada southern convert to a working interest position at kotaneelee  a significant amount of cash resources could be required if the operator were to aggressively drill multiple wells in the field 
drilling costs are estimated to be between and million gross to million net to canada southern s interest per well 
while the company has sufficient funds to meet these potential requirements  it is mindful of this potential significant cash requirement in its strategic and capital planning 
the company is evaluating the existing developed reserves at kotaneelee and further development opportunities on the lease  with the assistance of consultants including independent reserve engineers  gilbert laustsen jung associates ltd 
the oil and gas business is inherently risky and capital intensive and can require significant capital and cash resources to expand and develop the business 
the company s northeast british columbia properties are not as risky as kotaneelee  but cannot be considered low risk due to depth of drilling  surface access  and related costs 
now that settlement has been achieved  company management will be able to focus on managing the company s normal oil and gas operations 
canada southern commenced a capital program subsequent to settlement of the kotaneelee litigation 
the objective of the capital program is to diversify the company s cash flow  production  proven reserve base  and retain  replace or otherwise address expiring mineral leases 
this capital program was designed to explore and develop assets where the company can maintain control over the timing of the activities 
a significant portion of the total capital expenditures was dedicated to the acquisition of seismic data 
acquisition of seismic is one the early stages of the exploration cycle and upon evaluation  should result in the identification of suitable drilling locations in the future 
during the year ended december   canada southern expended  on capital additions of which approximately million occurred during the fourth quarter of for seismic  drilling  workovers  equipment  and other activities on lands outside of kotaneelee 
a summary of capital expenditures for the year ended december   by area  is as follows property name land seismic drilling completions facilities equipment total mike hazel mile coulee siphon clarke lake buick creek wargen others total to create a more balanced portfolio of risk opportunities  the company acquired certain low risk properties in the second quarter of canada southern acquired the mineral rights to approximately contiguous sections  acres of interest land in the mile coulee area of southern alberta 
to prove the technical concept of this lower risk  shallow natural gas area  the company drilled and cased exploration wells during october and november canada southern is currently performing technical evaluation of its mineral lease holdings in the siphon and mike hazel areas of northeast british columbia 
the company drilled and cased a working interest gas well at siphon in late this well is currently awaiting completion  stimulation and testing 
canada southern has also completed a sq 
mile proprietary d seismic program at mike hazel with the acquired data now being processed and awaiting geophysical interpretation 
the company may undertake drilling in at both areas pending completion of the geophysical and geological evaluations and economic analysis 
in the near term  canada southern expects to rely on internally generated cash flows and current cash on hand to provide sufficient resources to fund the company s annual capital expenditure program 
canada southern has established a provision for its potential share of future site restoration costs 
the estimated amount of these costs  which totals approximately  is being provided for on a unit of production basis in accordance with existing accounting standards and industry practice 
at december   canada southern had accrued approximately  of these costs with  remaining to be accrued in the future 
during the year ended december   canada southern expended  to abandon a well  and  to repair another well to return it to production 
both of these expenditures reduced the estimated remaining amount of future abandonment costs 
the company anticipates that capital expenditures on oil and gas activities during will range from million to million with the greatest uncertainties being i whether or not the operator at kotaneelee proposes a drilling program  ii the scope and estimated cost of any such proposed drilling program  and iii whether or not canada southern elects to convert from a carried interest to a working interest position at kotaneelee 
results of operations vs 
years ended december a comparison of revenues  costs and expenses  income taxes  net income and earnings per share for and is as follows year ended december  net change revenues costs and expenses settlement of litigation income tax provision net income net income per share basic dilutive for the fourth quarter of  the company s quarterly net loss from operations was approximately  or per share 
net income was lower in the fourth quarter as compared with previous quarters mainly due to recognition of the settlement with the contingent interest grantees described in item legal proceedings and higher depletion charges 
depletion expenses were higher due to capital spending during the fourth quarter of  and may remain at higher levels in the future 
as a result of the forgoing  and other expected increases in general and administrative costs  future earnings before unusual items may be lower than those experienced during see quarterly results table on page 
proceeds from carried interests increased to  during from  in significantly higher gas prices offset the production declines experienced during fourth quarter proceeds from carried interest revenue were lower than otherwise due to inclusion in the carried interest account  by the operator  of seismic acquisition expenditures in the amount of  net to canada southern 
the following is a comparison of the proceeds from carried interests for the years indicated year ended december  kotaneelee natural gas field other properties total because of the uncertainties as to production rates  natural gas prices and future capital expenditures  canada southern is unable to accurately predict the amount of future net production proceeds that it may receive from the fields 
production from the kotaneelee field natural gas mmcf per day  water bbls per day during the year ended december   compared to is as follows month mmcf d mmcf d bbls d bbls d january february march april may june july august september october november december during the period from june to july   the kotaneelee field was shut in not producing due to a scheduled facility turnaround at the duke energy fort nelson gas processing plant 
individual kotaneelee well production for the month of december was mmcf per day from the b well and mmcf per day from the i well december b was mmcf per day and the i was mmcf per day 
natural gas sales from the kotaneelee field are approximately of total monthly production due to shrinkage and fuel gas requirements 
canada southern s share of natural gas sales volumes decreased by from to from  mcf to  mcf respectively 
average gas prices increased and operating costs and capital costs increased by and respectively in as compared with water production has increased since the operator improved the water handling capabilities of the surface equipment during the first quarter of water production continues to increase and water handling capacity continues to be a concern 
natural gas production continues to decline as the reservoir pressure declines 
water production will at some point become a constraining factor on gas production 
the company is not able to predict with certainty the remaining economic life of the existing producing wells  their associated production profiles and the extent to which these wells will be able to access proven developed reserves 
gross water production for the month of december was  bbs per day from the b well and bbls per day from the i well water production in december b was  bbls per day and the i was bbls per day 
during the year  proceeds from carried interest included  of carried interest revenues relating to production periods prior to january  from the siphon property  which was converted to a working interest effective april  during the year  the operator of the carried interest properties at buick creek  wargen and clarke lake withheld approximately  in payments from the carried interest account to recover an amount claimed to have been overpaid to canada southern in prior years 
canada southern disputes the operator s position and is attempting to recover the disputed amount 
in accordance with the company s accounting policies  no recovery of the disputed amount has been recorded 
the resolution of this issue has been delayed by the completion of the interrelated wargen facility issue 
it is expected that this issue will be resolved during company carried interest natural gas volumes in thousand cubic feet mcf before deducting royalties and related liquids volumes in barrels bbls and the average sales price of gas per mcf and liquids per bbl sold during the periods indicated were as follows carried interests year ended december  year ended december  average price average price mcf bbls per mcf bbl total mcf bbls per mcf bbl total gas sales mcf liquid sales bbls transportation royalties operating costs capital costs total gas revenue increased from  in to  in there was a increase in the volumes of working interest gas sold and a increase in the average sales price for gas 
gas sales include royalty income  which increased from  in to  in royalty volumes sold increased by over  and the sales price per mcf increased over the same period 
as a result of capital expenditures  canada southern expects that gas revenue volumes will increase in the future 
the volumes in mcf before deducting royalties and the average price of gas per mcf sold during the periods indicated were as follows working and royalty interests year ended december  year ended december  average price average price mcf per mcf total mcf per mcf total gas sales royalty income royalties total oil and natural gas liquid sales increased by in to  compared to  in since canada southern sold most of its producing oil properties in  the majority of liquid sales are derived from natural gas liquids 
future oil sales are expected to be minimal unless additional producing properties are drilled or purchased 
crude oil and natural gas liquid unit sales in barrels bbls before deducting royalties and the average price per barrel sold during the periods indicated were as follows working and royalty interests year ended december  year ended december  average price average price bbls per bbl total bbls per bbl total liquid sales royalty income royalties total interest and other income increased in interest income increased from  to  in because more funds were available for investment 
the year includes proceeds from the sale of seismic data in the amount of  compared to  from such sales in investment yields and cash on hand have declined since december   therefore interest income may decline in the future 
general and administrative costs increased in to  from  in primarily because of increases in directors fees and expenses  consultants expenses  audit services  and insurance expense 
directors fees and expenses increased substantially due mainly to intense participation by all board members throughout the period in the complex settlement of the kotaneelee litigation  the response to the contingent interest claims on the kotaneelee settlement proceeds  and in planning for the resumption in normal exploration and development activities by the company 
during the period there were formal meetings of the board or committees thereof  and at least that number of informal meetings or teleconferences  directly related to the settlement 
the chairman of the board mr 
mcginity was continuously present in calgary during mos t of august and early september  and the board determined that an increase in the chairman s compensation was therefore warranted  retroactive to july  general and administrative costs have also increased as a result of the adoption of new disclosure and corporate governance regulations in both canada and the united states which have contributed to increased directors fees and expenses  and increased the company s legal  audit  and consultants fees 
no general and administrative expenses were capitalized during the period 
a comparative summary of general and administrative costs grouped by major category is as follows year ended december  directors fees and expenses consultants insurance expense shareholder communications salaries and benefits audit and related services other total legal expenses decreased during to  compared to  in these expenses were related primarily to the cost of the kotaneelee litigation 
legal work decreased significantly given the settlement of the litigation in early september while legal costs related to the litigation have decreased due to the kotaneelee settlement  new disclosure and corporate governance regulations have been adopted in both canada and the united states  and are expected to contribute to increased legal expenses in the future 
lease operating costs increased from  in to  in operating costs were higher in mainly due to resolution of certain facility ownership issues at buick creek and wargen 
in connection with being legally recognized as an owner of the buick creek facilities  canada southern became responsible for facility operating costs of  for the period from january  to december  discussions with the operator of the wargen facilities resulted in the accounting recognition of  of estimated operating expenses for the period january  to december  other adjustments to operating costs  which could lead to a one time material adjustment to operating costs  would be recorded in a future period 
any such amounts are currently undeterminable 
depletion  depreciation and amortization expense decreased in to  from  in depletion  depreciation and amortization are a relatively high percentage of the net book value of oil and gas properties and equipment mainly due to the limited expected life of the proven reserves at the kotaneelee field 
future site restoration costs decreased to  in from  in the decrease in the amount relates to cash expenditures incurred in the first quarter of that reduced the aggregate amount of future site restoration liabilities 
a well at jackfish was abandoned  and a well at clarke lake was repaired for reinstatement of production  resulting in a  reduction in the aggregate estimated corporate cost of site restoration 
in connection with settlement of the kotaneelee litigation in september  the company agreed to be responsible for its share of the future site restoration costs at kotaneelee 
as at december   the aggregate estimate of future site restoration obligation was  of which  has been recorded in the financial statements leaving the remaining  to be recorded in future per iods 
as a result  canada southern expects future site restoration costs to increase in the future 
effective january   canada southern adopted new accounting rules for future site restoration costs 
the impact of the changes is disclosed in note us gaap differences of the consolidated financial statements 
a foreign exchange loss of  was recorded in  as opposed to the exchange loss of in on canada southern s us investments 
canada southern held investments in marketable securities in us currency  which is subject to foreign exchange fluctuations 
at december   the us dollar investments totalled  us  december   us 
the strengthening of the canadian dollar compared to the us dollar resulted in the loss

years ended december a comparison of revenues  costs and expenses  income taxes  net income loss and earnings per share for and is as follows year ended december net change revenues costs and expenses income tax provision net income net income per share basic dilutive proceeds from carried interests decreased to  during from  in  mainly due to the decreased production volumes and lower gas prices 
effective for the production period beginning september  the working interest owners no longer deducted a processing fee on the monthly payments of carried interest revenues 
the following is a comparison of the proceeds from carried interests for the years indicated year ended december kotaneelee gas field other properties total natural gas sales from the kotaneelee field are approximately of total monthly production 
because of the uncertainties as to production rates  natural gas prices and future capital expenditures  canada southern is unable to accurately predict the amount of future net production proceeds that it may receive from the field 
in addition  water production has increased since and the producing field may require the drilling of another water disposal well 
to alleviate the concern of water disposal capacity the operator improved the water handling capabilities of the surface equipment during the first quarter of if water production were to continue to increase  future gas production from the b well could be adversely impacted

canada southern performed joint venture audits on three of the four kotaneelee working interest partners in the fourth quarter of after september   insurance premiums rose significantly 
with the election of two new directors in  directors fees and expenses increased over the prior year 
a comparative summary of general and administrative costs grouped by major category is as follows year ended december consultants salaries and benefits shareholder communications insurance expense directors fees and expenses audit and related services other total legal expenses decreased during to  compared to  in these expenses are related primarily to the cost of the kotaneelee litigation 
legal work associated with the appeal of the trial court s decision resulted in legal expenses in somewhat below those of lease operating costs increased from  in to  in operating costs were higher in mainly due to the emergency repair of one of the company s gas wells  the inclusion of accounting adjustments to the facility operating expenses at siphon  and a gas compressor turnaround at siphon 
in  canada southern also experienced the impact of a full year of operating expenses following the conversion from carried into working interest in early once canada southern resolves certain facility ownership issues at buick creek and wargen  it may be invoiced for certain previous period facility operating costs which could lead to a one time material adjustment to operating costs recorded in a future period 
any such amounts are currently undeterminable 
depletion  depreciation and amortization expense increased in to  from  in the increase in depletion  depreciation and amortization is mainly due to the impact of the decrease in canada southern s estimated reserves from the kotaneelee field 
the provision for site restoration increased to  in from  in  mainly due to the revision of future site restoration cost estimates and the impact of the decrease in canada southern s estimated reserves from the kotaneelee field

at december  compared to us 
at december  there were no writedowns during and the income tax provision increased to  in as compared to the income tax provision of  in during the period   of income taxes were provided which resulted in an effective tax of rate instead of the expected rate of because of the utilization of tax loss carry forwards and earned depletion not previously recorded 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk canada southern does not have any significant exposure to financial market risk as the only market risk sensitive instruments are investments in commercial paper and marketable securities 
at december   the carrying value of such investments including those classified as cash and cash equivalents was  which was approximately equal to fair value and face value of the investments 
canada southern utilizes the guidance provided from the dominion bond rating service limited dbrs commercial paper and short term rating scale in evaluating its investments 
dbrs is the benchmark rating service for money market securities in canada as are s p and moody s in the united states 
this rating scale is meant to give an indication of the risk that the borrower will not fulfill its repayment obligations in a timely manner 
dbrs utilizes three main classifications of investment quality  r prime credit quality  r adequate credit quality  and r speculative 
within each main classification  dbrs uses subset grades to designate the relative standing of credit within the particular category high  mid or low 
generally only government of canada guarante ed investments earn an r high rating 
to ensure capital preservation  canada southern s investment policy allows only for investments within the highest quality ratings of r high  mid  or low 
given that credit ratings can change rapidly in today s economy  canada southern s current practice is to invest in a particular investment for periods no longer than days 
as a result of the strategy to select high quality investments in combination with short terms to maturity  canada southern expects to hold the investments to maturity  and realize maturity value 
in addition  the investments in marketable securities included investments held in united states currency  which are subject to foreign exchange fluctuations 
at december   the us dollar investments totaled  us   us
