the corporation s products are sold under such well known brands as kleenex  scott  huggies  pull ups  kotex and depend 
in managing this global business  the corporation s management believes that developing new and improved products  responding effectively to competitive challenges  obtaining and maintaining leading market shares  controlling costs  and managing currency and commodity risks are important to the long term success of the corporation 
in the discussion and analysis of our results of operations and other related information we will refer to these factors 
product innovation our past results and future prospects depend in large part on product innovation 
we rely on our ability to develop and introduce new or improved products to drive sales and volume growth and to achieve and or maintain category leadership 
in order to develop new or improved products  we must develop the technology to support those products 
a major portion of our total research and development expenditures is directed toward new or improved personal care  tissue and health care products and nonwoven materials 
competitive environment our past results and future prospects are significantly affected by the competitive environment in which we operate 
we experience intense competition for sales of our principal products in our major markets  both domestically and internationally 
our products compete with widely advertised  well known  branded products  as well as private label products  which are typically sold at lower prices 
we have several major competitors in most of our markets  some of which are larger and more diversified 
the principal methods and elements of competition include brand recognition and loyalty  product innovation  quality and performance  price  and marketing and distribution capabilities 

table of contents part ii continued aggressive competitive actions by our competitors in and have required that we increase promotional spending in order to maintain our market shares 
we expect our competitors to continue to be aggressive in market shares achieving leading market shares in our principal products has been an important part of our past performance 
we hold the number or brand position in more than countries 
achieving and maintaining leading market shares is important because of ongoing consolidation of retailers and the trend of leading merchandisers seeking to stock only the top competitive brands 
we track us market share on a sales dollar basis with information provided by ac nielson for distribution through the food  drug and mass merchandising channels  excluding wal mart  warehouse clubs  dollar stores and certain other small outlets 
this group does not participate in reporting market share by brand 
cost controls to maintain our competitive position  we must control our manufacturing  distribution and other costs 
we have achieved cost savings from reducing material costs and manufacturing waste and realizing productivity gains and distribution efficiencies in each of our business segments 
our strategic investments in our information systems should also allow further costs savings through streamlining of our administrative operations 
foreign currency and commodity risks as a multinational enterprise  we are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
our ability to effectively manage these risks can have a material impact on our results of operations 
during  we continued to face intense competition in most of our markets 
in particular  the diaper and pants categories in north america and europe were affected by the competitive pricing and package sizing pressures that began in late in addition to lower net selling prices  our consumer tissue businesses were also adversely affected by higher materials input costs 
despite these challenges  we achieved improved results in our net sales grew percent 
we continued our focus on product innovation delivering a number of new and improved products  such as huggies convertible diaper pants  pull ups training pants with easy open sides  poise pantiliners  new viva towels in australia and new and improved surgical products in health care 
the strength of our portfolio of leading brands helped drive double digit sales growth to our top six global customers for the third year in a row 
while our operating profit decreased percent  net income increased percent 
we delivered cost savings of about million  near the upper end of our goal of million  which offset higher pension costs of nearly million 
in addition  we incurred higher costs for fiber  energy and product distribution 
other income expense  net reflects currency losses versus gains in net income benefited from a lower effective tax rate 
we achieved record cash flow from operations for the second consecutive year 
our strong cash flow permitted us to make cash contributions to our defined benefit pension trusts of about million  and we plan to contribute an additional million in we repurchased million shares of our common stock under authorized share repurchase programs at a cost of million 
we increased our annual cash dividend percent in and will increase it an additional percent in

increased sales volumes  particularly in north america for scott and cottonelle bathroom tissue and scott towels  and lower pulp costs were the primary drivers behind this growth

from through early  two of our affiliates in brazil purchased unused tax credits  as permitted by law  to reduce taxes otherwise payable 
during the fourth quarter  we determined that it was probable that a portion of the purchased tax credits would not be allowed by tax authorities nor would collection of the collateral or amounts pledged under sellers guarantees occur 
accordingly  in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a charge of million to other expense for these tax credits 
in  we established a team to investigate and to pursue actions to recover these losses 
in the second quarter of  evidence was discovered to suggest fraud by at least one employee of our affiliates and possibly several others in connection with the tax credit purchases 
we determined that the remaining purchased tax credits were invalid and that the collateral backing them was worthless 
we had previously concluded  during the december review  based on the advice of our outside advisors that these credits represented legitimate tax credits 
accordingly  in the second quarter of  we recorded a charge of million to other expense for losses associated with these tax credits 
we have no remaining financial exposure for purchased tax credits 
we have implemented various corrective actions to prevent this matter from recurring in the future  including terminating all the employees responsible for the decisions to purchase these tax credits 

table of contents part ii continued we have also filed civil and criminal actions against a former employee  third parties ie  intermediaries who sold or arranged for our affiliates purchase of tax credits  tax credit sellers  and legal counsel associated with the purchase of the tax credits

personnel changes have been made to strengthen the affiliates organizations and their internal control compliance 
additional income statement commentary synthetic fuel partnership in april  the corporation entered into an agreement whereby it acquired a percent minority interest in a synthetic fuel partnership 
the partnership is a variable interest entity that will become subject to the requirements of financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation fin revised december  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb  fin r as of march  the transaction was subject to the receipt of a favorable private letter ruling from the internal revenue service the irs confirming that the synthetic fuel produced by the partnership is eligible for synthetic fuel tax credits 
the partnership received the favorable letter ruling on october  the partnership s test procedures are in compliance with the requirements outlined by the irs 
these tax credits are not available for synthetic fuel produced after the production of synthetic fuel results in pretax losses 
in  these pretax losses totaled million and are reported as nonoperating expense on the corporation s income statement 
the production of synthetic fuel results in tax credits as well as tax deductions for the nonoperating losses  which reduce the corporation s income tax expense 
in  the corporation s participation in the synthetic fuel partnership resulted in million of tax credits  and the nonoperating losses generated an additional million of tax benefits  which combined to reduce the corporation s income tax provision by million 
the tax benefits and credits related to the operation of the partnership increased net income by million or 
per share 
the tax credits are shown as a reconciling item in the corporation s reconciliation of the us statutory rate to its effective income tax rate in note to the consolidated financial statements 
because the partnership has received the favorable private letter ruling from the irs and because the partnership s test procedures conform to irs procedures  the corporation believes its loss exposure under the synthetic fuel partnership is minimal 
application of fin r to this entity is not expected to have a material effect on the corporation s consolidated financial statements 
versus interest expense decreased primarily due to lower interest rates partially offset by a higher average level of debt 
the corporation s effective income tax rate was percent in compared with percent in the lower effective tax rate was primarily due to the benefits from the synthetic fuel partnership described above 
the corporation s share of net income of equity affiliates was million in compared with million in the decrease was primarily due to lower earnings at kimberly clark de mexico  sa de sa kcm primarily because of depreciation in the value of the peso 
kcm s operating profit benefited from higher sales volumes of about percent and cost savings programs 

table of contents part ii continued however  these positive factors could not overcome higher fiber and other materials costs and negative currency effects 
minority owners share of subsidiaries net income decreased percent primarily due to kca becoming a wholly owned subsidiary on june  versus interest expense decreased primarily due to lower interest rates  partially offset by a higher average level of debt 
the corporation s effective income tax rate was percent in compared with percent in the lower effective tax rate was primarily due to the discontinuance  for financial reporting purposes  of goodwill amortization that had not been deductible for income tax purposes 
the corporation s share of net income of equity companies was million in compared with million in the decrease was primarily due to lower earnings at kcm due to negative currency effects and a higher effective tax rate due to changes in mexican tax law 
although kcm s sales volumes increased more than percent  operating profit declined about percent due to lower net selling prices reflecting the competitive environment 
the consolidation of kca also impacted the corporation s share of net income of equity companies 
minority owners share of subsidiaries net income decreased percent primarily due to a lower return on the preferred securities held by the minority interest in the corporation s consolidated foreign financing subsidiary as described below under financing commentary 
during  the emerging issues task force eitf issued eitf  accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer or a reseller of the vendor s products 
the corporation adopted eitf effective january  the adoption of eitf did not change reported earnings for but did require the recording of a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in  equal to an after tax charge of approximately

cash flow commentary cash provided by operations increased million or percent to a record billion 
the reported amounts of operating working capital are affected by changes in currency exchange rates 
from a cash flow perspective  the corporation invested less cash in operating working capital in primarily due to improved cash collections of trade accounts receivable in europe  income tax refunds of prior year taxes and lower income tax payments

the unconditional purchase obligations are for the purchase of raw materials  primarily pulp  and utilities  principally electricity 
although the corporation is primarily liable for payments on the above operating leases and unconditional purchase obligations  based on historic operating performance and 
table of contents part ii continued forecasted future cash flows  management believes the corporation s exposure to losses  if any  under these arrangements is not material 
the open purchase orders displayed in the table represent amounts the corporation anticipates will become payable within the next year for goods and services the corporation has negotiated for delivery 
the table does not include anticipated payments related to the synthetic fuel partnership described above

during the third quarter of  the corporation acquired an additional percent interest in kimberly clark peru sa and the remaining percent interest in its tissue joint venture in brazil klabin kimberly sa the cost of these acquisitions totaled approximately million 
these acquisitions were a result of the partners in each of the ventures exercising their options to sell their ownership interest to the corporation 
as of december   the preliminary allocation of the purchase price resulted in approximately million of goodwill being recorded on these acquisitions 
the allocation of the purchase price to the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired is currently in process and will be completed by the second quarter of the net increase in time deposits was primarily attributable to investment of cash accumulated in korea 

table of contents part ii continued financing commentary the following table contains information for shares repurchased as part of publicly announced share repurchase programs in millions  except per share amounts

moody s investor service maintained its short and long term ratings but changed the corporation s outlook to negative from stable  indicating that a ratings downgrade could be possible within the next months 
these changes were primarily based on the corporation s business performance in the heightened competitive environment and because s p changed the way in which it evaluates liabilities for pensions and other postretirement benefits 
management believes that these 
table of contents part ii continued actions will not have a material adverse effect on the corporation s access to credit or its borrowing costs since these credit ratings remain strong and are in the top eight percent of companies listed in s p s ranking of the largest companies 
the corporation s commercial paper continues to be rated in the top category

on december   the corporation announced the repurchase of million of industrial revenue development bonds to be effective february  at december   the corporation classified the million as debt payable within one year and reduced long term debt by that same amount

the notes receivable are backed by irrevocable standby letters of credit issued by money center banks  which aggregated million at december  because the corporation desired to monetize the million of notes receivable and continue the deferral of current income taxes on the gains  in the corporation transferred the notes received from the sale to a noncontrolled financing entity  and in it transferred the notes received from the sale to another 
table of contents part ii continued noncontrolled financing entity 
the corporation has minority voting interests in each of the financing entities collectively  the financing entities 
the transfers of the notes and certain other assets to the financing entities were made at fair value  were accounted for as asset sales and resulted in no gain or loss 
in conjunction with the transfer of the notes and other assets  the financing entities became obligated for million in third party debt financing 
a nonaffiliated financial institution has made substantive capital investments in each of the financing entities  has majority voting control over them and has substantive risks and rewards of ownership of the assets in the financing entities 
the corporation also contributed intercompany notes receivable aggregating million and intercompany preferred stock of million to the financing entities  which serve as secondary collateral for the third party lending arrangements 
in the unlikely event of default by both of the money center banks that provided the irrevocable standby letters of credit  the corporation could experience a maximum loss of million under these arrangements 
the corporation has not consolidated the financing entities because it is not the primary beneficiary of either entity 
rather  it will continue to account for its ownership interests in these entities using the equity method of accounting 
the corporation retains equity interests in the financing entities for which the legal right of offset exists against the intercompany notes 
as a result  the intercompany notes payable have been offset against the corporation s equity interests in the financing entities for financial reporting purposes 
see financing commentary above for a description of the corporation s luxembourg based financing subsidiary  which is consolidated because the corporation is the primary beneficiary of the entity 
real estate entities the corporation holds a significant variable interest in certain real estate entities that will become subject to the requirements of fin r as of march  following is a description of these real estate entities 
in  the corporation began participating in the us affordable and historic renovation real estate markets 
investments in these markets are encouraged by laws enacted by the united states congress and related federal income tax rules and regulations 
accordingly  these investments generate income tax credits and tax losses that are used to reduce the corporation s income tax liabilities 
the corporation has invested in these markets through i partnership arrangements in which it is a limited partner  ii limited liability companies llcs in which it is a nonmanaging member and iii investments in various funds in which the corporation is one of many noncontrolling investors 
these entities borrow money from third parties generally on a nonrecourse basis and invest in and own various real estate projects 
the corporation is still evaluating the effect of fin r on its real estate entities 
if the corporation is determined to be the primary beneficiary of any of these real estate entities  it will consolidate such entity as of march  in the december  financial statements  the corporation has accounted for its interests in the real estate entities by the equity method of accounting or by the effective yield method  as appropriate  and has accounted for the related income tax credits and other tax benefits as a reduction in the income tax provision 
as of december   the corporation had a net equity of million in its nonconsolidated real estate entities 
income tax credits totaling approximately million will be claimed on the corporation s income tax returns through december  as of december   total permanent financing debt for the nonconsolidated entities was million 
a total of million of the permanent financing debt is guaranteed by the corporation and the remainder of this debt is not supported or guaranteed by the corporation 
except for the guaranteed portion  permanent financing debt is secured solely by the properties and is nonrecourse to the corporation 
from time to time  temporary interim financing is guaranteed by the corporation 
in general  the corporation s interim financing guarantees are eliminated at the time permanent financing is obtained 
at december   million of temporary interim financing associated with these nonconsolidated real estate entities was guaranteed by the corporation 

table of contents part ii continued if the corporation s investments in these real estate entities were to be disposed of at their carrying amounts  a portion of the tax credits may be recaptured and may result in a charge to earnings 
as of december   this recapture risk is estimated to be million 
the corporation has no current intention of disposing of these investments during the recapture period  nor does it anticipate the need to do so in the foreseeable future in order to satisfy any anticipated liquidity need 
accordingly  the recapture risk is considered to be remote 
at december   the corporation s maximum loss exposure for its real estate entities is estimated to be million and was composed of its net equity in these entities of million  its permanent financing guarantees of million  its interim financing guarantees of million and the income tax credit recapture risk of million 
management believes the likelihood of loss on these projects is not material due to the current economic returns on these projects 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from these estimates  and changes in these estimates are recorded when known 
the critical accounting policies used by management in the preparation of the corporation s consolidated financial statements are those that are important both to the presentation of the corporation s financial condition and results of operations and require significant judgments by management with regard to estimates used 
the critical judgments by management relate to consumer and trade promotion and rebate accruals  pension benefits  retained insurable risks  excess and obsolete inventory  allowance for doubtful accounts  useful lives for depreciation and amortization  future cash flows associated with impairment testing for goodwill and long lived assets and for determining the primary beneficiary of variable interest entities  deferred tax assets and potential income tax assessments  and contingencies 
the corporation s critical accounting policies have been reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors 
promotion and rebate accruals among those factors affecting the accruals for promotions and rebates are estimates of the number of consumer coupons that will be redeemed  the type and number of activities within promotional programs between the corporation and its trade customers and the quantity of products distributors have sold to specific customers 
generally  we base our estimates for consumer coupon costs on historical patterns of coupon redemption  influenced by judgments about current market conditions such as competitive activity in specific product categories 
estimates of trade promotion liabilities for promotional program costs incurred  but unpaid  are generally based on estimates of the quantity of customer sales  timing of promotional activities and forecasted costs for activities within the promotional programs 
settlement of these liabilities sometimes occurs in periods subsequent to the date of the promotion activity 
trade promotion programs include introductory marketing funds such as slotting fees  cooperative marketing programs  temporary price reductions  favorable end of aisle or in store product displays and other activities conducted by the customers to promote the corporation s products 
promotion accruals as of december  and were million and million  respectively 
rebate accruals as of december  and were million and million  respectively 
pension benefits the corporation and its subsidiaries in north america and the united kingdom have defined benefit pension plans the principal plans and or defined contribution retirement plans covering substantially all regular employees 
certain other subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans or  in certain countries  
table of contents part ii continued termination pay plans covering substantially all regular employees 
the funding policy for the qualified defined benefit plans in north america and the defined benefit plans in the united kingdom is to contribute assets to fully fund the accumulated benefit obligation abo 
subject to regulatory and tax deductibility limits  any funding shortfall will be eliminated over a reasonable number of years 
nonqualified us plans providing pension benefits in excess of limitations imposed by the us income tax code are not funded 
funding for the remaining defined benefit plans outside the us is based on legal requirements  tax considerations  investment opportunities  and customary business practices in such countries 
consolidated pension expense for defined benefit pension plans was million in compared with million for pension expense is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions applied to each of the defined benefit plans 
the weighted average expected long term rate of return on pension fund assets used to calculate pension expense was percent in compared with percent in and will be percent in the expected long term rate of return on pension fund assets was determined based on several factors  including input from our pension investment consultants and projected long term returns of broad equity and bond indices 
we also considered our us plan s historical year and year compounded annual returns of percent and percent  respectively  which have been in excess of these broad equity and bond benchmark indices 
we anticipate that on average the investment managers for each of the plans comprising the principal plans will generate annual long term rates of return of at least percent 
our expected long term rate of return on the assets in the principal plans is based on an asset allocation assumption of about percent with equity managers  with expected long term rates of return of approximately percent  and percent with fixed income managers  with an expected long term rate of return of about percent 
we regularly review our actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance our investments to our targeted allocation when considered appropriate 
also  when deemed appropriate  we execute hedging strategies using index options and futures to limit the downside exposure of certain investments by trading off upside potential above an acceptable level 
we executed such hedging strategies in  and no hedging instruments are currently in place beyond january we will continue to evaluate our long term rate of return assumptions at least annually and will adjust them as necessary 
we determine pension expense on the fair value of assets rather than a calculated value that averages gains and losses calculated value over a period of years 
investment gains or losses represent the difference between the expected return calculated using the fair value of assets and the actual return based on the fair value of assets 
we recognize the variance between actual and expected gains and losses on pension assets in pension expense more rapidly than we would if we used a calculated value for plan assets 
as of december   the principal plans had cumulative unrecognized investment losses and other actuarial losses of approximately billion 
these unrecognized net losses may increase our future pension expense if not offset by i actual investment returns that exceed the assumed investment returns  or ii other factors  including reduced pension liabilities arising from higher discount rates used to calculate our pension obligations  or iii other actuarial gains  including whether such accumulated actuarial losses at each measurement date exceed the corridor determined under sfas  employers accounting for pensions 
the discount or settlement rate that we utilize for determining the present value of future pension obligations generally has been based in the us on the yield reported for the long term aa rated corporate bond indexes  converted to an equivalent one year compound basis 
from time to time  and most recently at december   we validated this practice by assembling a hypothetical portfolio of high quality debt securities where the portfolio cash flows correspond to expected future benefit payments 
we use similar techniques for establishing the discount rates for our non us principal plans 
the weighted average discount rate for the principal plans decreased to percent at december  from percent at december  
table of contents part ii continued we estimate that our consolidated pension expense will approximate million in this estimate reflects the effect of the actuarial losses and is based on an expected weighted average long term rate of return on assets in the principal plans of percent  a weighted average discount rate for the principal plans of percent and various other assumptions 
pension expense beyond will depend on future investment performance  the corporation s contributions to the pension trusts  changes in discount rates and various other factors related to the covered employees in the plans 
if the expected long term rate of return on assets for our principal plans was lowered by percent  our annual pension expense would increase by approximately million 
if the discount rate assumptions for these same plans were reduced by percent  our annual pension expense would increase by approximately million and our december  minimum pension liability would increase by about million 
the fair value of the assets in our defined benefit plans increased from billion at december  to billion at december   primarily due to investment gains and plan contributions exceeding payments for pension benefits and plan expenses 
lower discount rates have caused the projected benefit obligations the pbo of the defined benefit plans to exceed the fair value of plan assets by approximately billion at december   compared with approximately billion at december  primarily due to the lower discount rates  the abo of our defined benefit plans exceeded plan assets by about 
billion at the end of at the end of  the abo exceeded the fair value of plan assets by about 
billion 
on a consolidated basis  the corporation contributed about million to pension trusts in compared with million in in addition  the corporation made direct benefit payments of million in compared to million in we estimate that the corporation will contribute about million to pension trusts in the discount rate used for each country s pension obligation is identical to the discount rate used for that country s other postretirement obligation 
the discount rates displayed for the two types of obligations for the corporation s consolidated operations may appear different due to the weighting used in the calculation of the two weighted average discount rates 
retained insurable risks we retain selected insurable risks  primarily related to property damage  workers compensation  and product  automobile and premises liability based upon historical loss patterns and management s judgment of cost effective risk retention 
accrued liabilities for incurred but not reported events  principally related to workers compensation and automobile liability  are based upon loss development factors provided to us by our external insurance brokers 
excess and obsolete inventory we require all excess  obsolete  damaged or off quality inventories including raw materials  in process  finished goods  and spare parts to be adequately reserved for or to be disposed of 
our process requires an ongoing tracking of the aging of inventories to be reviewed in conjunction with current marketing plans to ensure that any excess or obsolete inventories are identified on a timely basis 
this process requires judgments be made about the salability of existing stock in relation to sales projections 
the evaluation of the adequacy of provision for obsolete and excess inventories is performed on at least a quarterly basis 
no provisions for future anticipated obsolescence  damage or off quality inventories are made 
allowance for doubtful accounts we provide an allowance for doubtful accounts that represents our best estimate of the accounts receivable that will ultimately not be collected 
we base our estimate on  among other things  historical collection 
table of contents part ii continued experience  a review of the current aging status of customer receivables  and a review of specific information for those customers that are deemed to be higher risk 
when we become aware of a customer whose continued operating success is questionable  we closely monitor collection of their receivable balance and may require the customer to prepay for current shipments 
if a customer enters a bankruptcy action  we monitor the progress of that action to determine when and if an additional provision for non collectibility is warranted 
we evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts on at least a quarterly basis 
the allowance for doubtful accounts at december  and was million and million  respectively  and our write off of uncollectible accounts was million and million in and  respectively 
property and depreciation estimating the useful lives of property  plant and equipment requires the exercise of management judgment  and actual lives may differ from these estimates 
changes to these initial useful life estimates are made when appropriate 
property  plant and equipment are tested for impairment in accordance with sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of such long lived assets may not be recoverable from future net pretax cash flows 
impairment testing requires significant management judgment including estimating the future success of product lines  future sales volumes  growth rates for selling prices and costs  alternative uses for the assets and estimated proceeds from disposal of the assets 
impairment testing is conducted at the lowest level where cash flows can be measured and are independent of cash flows of other assets 
an asset impairment would be indicated if the sum of the expected future net pretax cash flows from the use of the asset undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying amount of the asset 
an impairment loss would be measured based on the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying amount 
we determine fair value based on an expected present value technique in which multiple cash flow scenarios that reflect a range of possible outcomes and a risk free rate of interest are used to estimate fair value 
the estimates and assumptions used in the impairment analysis are consistent with the business plans and estimates we use to manage our business operations and to make acquisition and divestiture decisions 
the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease the estimated fair value of the asset and would increase or decrease the impairment charge 
actual outcomes may differ from the estimates 
for example  if our products fail to achieve volume and pricing estimates or if market conditions change or other significant estimates are not realized  then our revenue and cost forecasts may not be achieved  and we may be required to recognize additional impairment charges 
goodwill and other intangible assets we test the carrying amount of goodwill annually as of the beginning of the fourth quarter and whenever events or circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred 
impairment testing is performed in accordance with sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
impairment testing is conducted at the operating segment level of our businesses and is based on a discounted cash flow approach to determine the fair value of each operating segment 
the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment including estimating future sales volumes  growth rates of selling prices and costs  changes in working capital  investments in property and equipment and the selection of an appropriate discount rate 
we also test the sensitivities of these fair value estimates to changes in our growth assumptions of sales volumes  selling prices and costs 
if the carrying amount of an operating segment that contains goodwill exceeds fair value  a possible impairment would be indicated 
if a possible impairment is indicated  we would estimate the implied fair value of goodwill by comparing the carrying amount of the net assets of the unit excluding goodwill to the total fair value of the unit 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  an impairment charge would be 
table of contents part ii continued recorded 
we also use judgment in assessing whether we need to test more frequently for impairment than annually 
factors such as unexpected adverse economic conditions  competition  product changes and other external events may require more frequent assessments 
we have completed our annual goodwill impairment testing and have determined that none of our billion of goodwill is impaired 
we have no intangible assets with indefinite useful lives 
we have other intangible assets with a gross carrying amount of approximately million and a net carrying amount of about million 
these intangibles are being amortized over their estimated useful lives and are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred 
if the carrying amount of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value based on estimated future undiscounted cash flows  an impairment loss would be indicated 
the amount of the impairment loss to be recorded would be based on the excess of the carrying amount of the intangible asset over its discounted future cash flows 
we use judgment in assessing whether the carrying amount of our intangible assets is not expected to be recoverable over their estimated remaining useful lives 
the factors considered are similar to those outlined in the goodwill impairment discussion above 
primary beneficiary determination of variable interest entities the determination of the primary beneficiary of variable interest entities vies under fin r requires estimating the probable future cash flows of each vie using a computer simulation model  determining the variability of such cash flows and their present values 
estimating the probable future cash flows of each vie requires the exercise of significant management judgment 
the resulting present values are then allocated to the various participants in each vie in accordance with their beneficial interests 
the participant that is allocated the majority of the present value of the variability is the primary beneficiary and is required to consolidate the vie under fin r 
deferred income taxes and potential assessments as of december   the corporation has recorded deferred tax assets related to income tax loss carryforwards and income tax credits totaling million and has established valuation allowances against these deferred tax assets of million  thereby resulting in a net deferred tax asset of million 
as of december   the net deferred tax asset was million 
these income tax losses and credits are in non us taxing jurisdictions and in certain states within the non us in determining the valuation allowances to establish against these deferred tax assets  the corporation considers many factors  including the specific taxing jurisdiction  the carryforward period  income tax strategies and forecasted earnings for the entities in each jurisdiction 
a valuation allowance is recognized if  based on the weight of available evidence  the corporation concludes that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
as of december   united states income taxes and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on approximately billion of unremitted earnings of subsidiaries operating outside the us in accordance with apb  accounting for income taxes  special areas 
these earnings are considered by management to be invested indefinitely 
however  they would be subject to income tax if they were remitted as dividends  were lent to the corporation or a us affiliate  or if the corporation were to sell its stock in the subsidiaries 
it is not practicable to determine the amount of unrecognized deferred us income tax liability on these unremitted earnings 
we periodically determine whether our non us subsidiaries will invest their undistributed earnings indefinitely and reassess this determination as appropriate 
following this assessment  we would provide deferred income taxes on any earnings that were determined to no longer be indefinitely invested 
in addition  we have recorded a liability for potential income tax assessments 
although management believes this liability for potential exposure to be adequate  the liability may be affected by new laws  new 
table of contents part ii continued interpretations of existing laws and rulings by tax authorities 
accordingly  actual payments may differ from estimates  at which time our income tax expense would be adjusted 
the internal revenue service is currently examining our consolidated income tax returns for through the examination is expected to be completed by the end of contingencies and legal matters litigation the following is a brief description of certain legal and administrative proceedings to which the corporation or its subsidiaries is a party or to which the corporation s or its subsidiaries properties are subject 
in management s opinion  none of the legal and administrative proceedings described below  individually or in the aggregate  is expected to have a material adverse effect on the corporation s business  financial condition or results of operations 
as of december   safeskin was a party to product liability lawsuits seeking monetary damages  in most cases of an unspecified amount 
safeskin is typically one of several defendants who manufacture or sell natural rubber latex gloves 
these lawsuits allege injuries ranging from dermatitis to severe allergic reactions caused by the residual chemicals or latex proteins in gloves worn by health care workers and other individuals while performing their duties 
safeskin has referred the defense of these lawsuits to its insurance carriers and management believes its insurance coverage is adequate for these types of claims 
as of december   the corporation  along with many other nonaffiliated companies  was a party to lawsuits with allegations of personal injury resulting from asbestos exposure on the defendants premises and allegations that the defendants manufactured  sold  distributed or installed products which cause asbestos related lung disease 
these general allegations are often made against the corporation without any apparent evidence or identification of a specific product or premises of the corporation 
the corporation has denied the allegations and raised numerous defenses in all of these asbestos cases 
all asbestos claims have been tendered to the corporation s insurance carriers for defense and indemnity 
the financial statements reflect appropriate accruals for the corporation s portion of the costs estimated to be incurred in connection with resolving these claims 
contingency one of the corporation s north american tissue mills has an agreement to provide its local utility company a specified amount of electric power for each of the next years 
in the event that the mill was shut down  the corporation would be required to continue to operate the power generation facility on behalf of its owner  the local utility company 
the net present value of the cost to fulfill this agreement as of december  is estimated to be approximately million 
management considers the probability of closure of this mill to be remote 
environmental matters the corporation has been named a potentially responsible party under the provisions of the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act  or analogous state statutes  at a number of waste disposal sites  none of which  individually or in the aggregate  in management s opinion  is likely to have a material adverse effect on the corporation s business  financial condition or results of operations 
new accounting standards in december  fasb issued fin r 
fin r requires consolidation of entities in which the corporation is the primary beneficiary  despite not having voting control 
likewise  it does not permit 
table of contents part ii continued consolidation of entities in which the corporation has voting control but is not the primary beneficiary 
the corporation adopted fin r for its luxembourg based financing subsidiary described in financing commentary and the financing entities described in variable interest entities 
as permitted by fin r  the corporation has deferred application of fin r to march  for its real estate entities and the synthetic fuel partnership described above 
on december   the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of the act became law 
among other things  the act provides a prescription drug benefit under medicare medicare part d and a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a prescription drug benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to medicare part d 
the corporation could amend its retiree health care benefit plans to better align the plans with the new act 
in accordance with fasb staff position  the corporation has elected to defer recognizing the effects of the act because authoritative guidance on the accounting for the federal subsidy provided by the act is pending 
such guidance  when issued by the fasb  may require the corporation to change previously reported information 
consequently  the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation and net periodic postretirement cost presented in the financial statements and accompanying notes do not reflect the effects of the act 
in december  the fasb issued sfas revised  employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits  sfas r 
sfas r revises the disclosures for pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans 
the corporation adopted sfas r s annual disclosure requirements 
sfas r will require certain additional disclosures in including disclosure of interim period information 
the corporation will adopt the additional disclosure requirements of sfas r in accordance with its prescribed effective dates 
business outlook the corporation s priorities for are to deliver top and bottom line growth in line with the long term global business plan objectives that were announced in july those targets are to percent top line growth and mid to high single digit bottom line growth 
the corporation also intends to deliver the benefits from its new capital allocation process  namely  to reduce capital spending and to focus on improving working capital as a percent of net sales 
the expectation that net sales will grow to percent assumes that volume growth will be the key driver 
based on current exchange rates  currency effects are expected to be somewhat positive but less than percent for as a whole 
however  the currency effect will be offset by lower pricing as the corporation is expecting continued intense competition 
net income growth is anticipated to be achieved with the improved net sales helping to drive earnings growth as well as a continued focus on sustainable cost reduction 
the corporation has set an aggressive target for to reduce costs by approximately million 
these cost savings should more than offset anticipated inflationary cost increases in fiber  energy and employee health care in along with a modest increase in pension expense 
in addition  the corporation foresees improved results from k c de mexico in  building on the strong sales volume momentum in that company s consumer business in the second half of including the impact of a slightly higher effective tax rate  the corporation anticipates that diluted earnings per share will be in a range of to for the corporation expects that capital spending will be about million in  toward the low end of its long term target of to percent of net sales 
the corporation believes that its cash flows will remain strong which will allow it to spend approximately million to repurchase about percent of its outstanding common stock  depending on market conditions 
also  the corporation s solid cash flow has enabled it to raise its dividend by nearly percent in  marking the nd consecutive annual increase in its dividend 

table of contents part ii continued the corporation expects that the synthetic fuel partnership transaction entered into in will result in expenses  federal income tax benefits and additional net income annually through the corporation anticipates that the benefit in will be slightly higher than in  while and will be similar to  and is expected to be somewhat lower than however  the benefits from this transaction in those subsequent years are expected to be partially offset by the expiration of benefits from other tax savings initiatives 
in january  the corporation announced changes to reorganize its personal care and consumer tissue businesses into two separate north atlantic personal care and consumer tissue groups and to put its operations in developing and emerging markets into one group 
the corporation s business to business segment will now include its north american pulp operations 
in addition  the wet wipes business will be part of the personal care segment instead of the consumer tissue segment 
the corporation will continue to have three global businesses led by individuals who have the accountability and the authority to make global decisions 
this new structure is expected to help increase the corporation s speed in translating consumer and customer insights into innovative products  streamlining decision making and helping to deliver cost reductions on a sustainable basis 
on february   the corporation announced that it was evaluating the possible tax free spin off of its neenah paper and technical paper businesses  along with its pulp and timber assets in pictou  nova scotia and terrace bay  ontario the pulp and paper operations 
the transaction is subject to approval by the board of directors and  if approved  is expected to occur in the second half of the following supplementary information presents the historical net sales of the corporation excluding the pulp and paper operations and the historical net sales on a stand alone basis of the pulp and paper operations 
the combination of the net sales of the corporation excluding the pulp and paper operations and the net sales of the pulp and paper operations on a stand alone basis will not equal the corporation s consolidated net sales because intercompany transactions are eliminated in the preparation of the corporation s consolidated financial statements 
the net sales of the pulp and paper operations may not be indicative of its net sales in the future  or what they would have been if the pulp and paper operations had been a separate company during the periods presented 
the corporation s historical net sales excluding the pulp and paper operations were  million and  million for and  respectively 
the historical net sales of the pulp and paper operations on a stand alone basis were approximately million and million for and  respectively 
intercompany transfers of pulp from the pulp and paper operations to the corporation pulp sales by the pulp business and pulp purchases by the corporation are included in the corporation s consolidated financial statements at cost 
if the spin off of the pulp and paper operations occurs  any pulp purchased by the corporation from the stand alone pulp and paper operations will be based on market prices  which could be more or less than historical costs 
information concerning forward looking statements certain matters discussed in this report concerning  among other things  the business outlook  including new product introductions  cost savings  anticipated financial and operating results  strategies  contingencies and contemplated transactions of the corporation  constitute forward looking statements and are based upon management s expectations and beliefs concerning future events impacting the corporation 
there can be no assurance that these events will occur or that the corporation s results will be as estimated 

table of contents part ii continued the assumptions used as a basis for the forward looking statements include many estimates that  among other things  depend on the achievement of future cost savings and projected volume increases 
in addition  many factors outside the control of the corporation  including the prices of the corporation s raw materials  potential competitive pressures on selling prices or advertising and promotion expenses for the corporation s products  and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  as well as general economic conditions in the markets in which the corporation does business  also could impact the realization of such estimates 
for a description of these and other factors that could cause the corporation s future results to differ materially from those expressed in any such forward looking statements  see item i of this annual report on form k entitled factors that may affect future results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a multinational enterprise  the corporation is exposed to risks such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and commodity prices 
a variety of practices are employed to manage these risks  including operating and financing activities and  where deemed appropriate  the use of derivative instruments 
derivative instruments are used only for risk management purposes and not for speculation or trading 
all foreign currency derivative instruments are either exchange traded or are entered into with major financial institutions 
the corporation s credit exposure under these arrangements is limited to the fair value of the agreements with a positive fair value at the reporting date 
credit risk with respect to the counterparties is considered minimal in view of the financial strength of the counterparties 
in accordance with sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  the corporation records all derivative instruments as assets or liabilities on the balance sheet at fair value 
changes in the fair value of derivatives are either recorded in income or other comprehensive income  as appropriate 
the gain or loss on derivatives designated as fair value hedges and the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are included in current income in the period that changes in fair value occur 
the gain or loss on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges is included in other comprehensive income in the period that changes in fair value occur and is reclassified to income in the same period that the hedged item affects income 
the gain or loss on derivatives that have not been designated as hedging instruments is included in current income in the period that changes in fair value occur 
presented below is a description of our most significant risks foreign currency risk  interest rate risk and commodity price risk together with a sensitivity analysis  performed annually  of each of these risks based on selected changes in market rates and prices 
these analyses reflect our view of changes which are reasonably possible to occur over a one year period 
foreign currency risk foreign currency risk is managed by the use of foreign currency forward  option and swap contracts 
the use of these instruments allows management of transactional exposure to exchange rate fluctuations because the gains or losses incurred on the derivative instruments will offset  in whole or in part  losses or gains on the underlying foreign currency exposure 
management of foreign currency transactional exposures was not changed during  and management does not foresee or expect any significant change in such exposures or in the strategies it employs to manage them in the near future 
foreign currency contracts and transactional exposures are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
we perform an annual test to quantify the effects that possible changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on our annual operating profit based on the foreign currency contracts and transactional exposures of the corporation and its foreign affiliates at the current year end 
the effect is 
table of contents part ii continued calculated by multiplying each affiliate s net monetary asset or liability position by a percent change in the foreign currency exchange rate versus the us dollar 
the results of this sensitivity test are presented in the following paragraph 
as of december   a percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the us dollar against the prevailing market rates of foreign currencies involving balance sheet transactional exposures would have resulted in a net pretax loss of approximately million 
these hypothetical losses on transactional exposures are based on the difference between the december  rates and the assumed rates 
in the view of management  the above hypothetical losses resulting from these assumed changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not material to the corporation s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
the translation of the balance sheets of our non us operations from local currencies into us dollars is also sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
consequently  we perform an annual test to determine if changes in currency exchange rates would have a significant effect on the translation of the balance sheets of our non us operations into us dollars 
these translation gains or losses are recorded as unrealized translation adjustments uta within stockholders equity 
the hypothetical increase in uta is calculated by multiplying the net assets of these non us operations by a percent change in the currency exchange rates 
the results of this sensitivity test are presented in the following paragraph 
as of december   a percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the us dollar against the prevailing market rates of our foreign currency translation exposures would have reduced stockholders equity by approximately million 
these hypothetical increases in uta are based on the difference between the december  exchange rates and the assumed rates 
in the view of management  the above uta adjustments resulting from these assumed changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not material to the corporation s consolidated financial position 
interest rate risk interest rate risk is managed through the maintenance of a portfolio of variable and fixed rate debt composed of short and long term instruments 
the objective is to maintain a cost effective mix that management deems appropriate 
at december   the debt portfolio was composed of approximately percent variable rate debt  adjusted for the effect of variable rate assets  and percent fixed rate debt 
the strategy employed to manage exposure to interest rate fluctuations did not change significantly during and management does not foresee or expect any significant changes in its exposure to interest rate fluctuations or in how such exposure is managed in the near future 
we perform two separate tests to determine whether changes in interest rates would have a significant effect on our financial position or future results of operations 
both tests are based on our consolidated debt levels at the time of the test 
the first test estimates the effect of interest rate changes on our fixed rate debt 
interest rate changes would result in gains or losses in the market value of fixed rate debt due to differences between the current market interest rates and the rates governing these instruments 
with respect to fixed rate debt outstanding at december   a percent decrease in interest rates would have increased the fair value of fixed rate debt by about million 
the second test estimates the potential effect on future pretax income that would result from increased interest rates applied to our current level of variable rate debt 
with respect to commercial paper and other variable rate debt  a percent increase in interest rates would have had no material effect on the future results of operations or cash flows 
commodity price risk the corporation is subject to commodity price risk  the most significant of which relates to the price of pulp 
selling prices of tissue products are influenced  in part  by the market price for pulp  which is determined 
table of contents part ii continued by industry supply and demand 
on a worldwide basis  the corporation supplies approximately percent of its virgin fiber needs from internal pulp manufacturing operations 
management still intends to reduce its level of pulp integration  when market conditions permit  and such a reduction in pulp integration  if accomplished  could increase the corporation s commodity price risk 
specifically  increases in pulp prices could adversely affect earnings if selling prices are not adjusted or if such adjustments significantly trail the increases in pulp prices 
derivative instruments have not been used to manage these risks 
management does not believe that commodity price risk is material to the corporation s business or its consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in addition  the corporation is subject to price risk for utilities  primarily natural gas  which are used in its manufacturing operations 
derivative instruments are used to hedge this risk when it is deemed prudent to do so by management
