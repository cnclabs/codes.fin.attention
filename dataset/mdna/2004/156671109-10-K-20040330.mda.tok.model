item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview contained in this discussion and elsewhere in this annual report are forward looking statements which management believes to be reasonable and informative 
such statements are based on assumptions which may not prove to be correct for reasons management cannot predict 
consequently  the inclusion of forward looking statements should not be considered as representations by the trust or its management that expected results will be achieved or that stated objectives will be attained 
factors that might cause such a difference include  among others  the following dependence on the performance of key personnel and independent property management firms  risks associated with the level of competition in the trust s markets  changes in mortgage interest rates  changes in real estate tax rates and or assessed valuations  and  the unpredictability of economic and regulatory conditions 
during all of and the trust owned or controlled fifteen apartment communities containing  apartment units  three multi tenant commercial properties containing  rentable square feet  and two restaurant properties leased to operators under net leases 
five of the apartment properties containing units are owned by separate partnerships that are controlled by the trust through a wholly owned subsidiary 
a description of partnership owned real estate acquisitions is contained in note to the financial statements 
effective january   the holders of  operating partnership units were granted the option to exchange them  one for one  for shares of beneficial interest at any time until november   at which time the trust  at its option  may issue shares for any outstanding op units 
as of january  and  holders of and  respectively of the outstanding units  had exercised their exchange options 
see note to the financial statements

the  apartment units in the portfolio throughout and contributed of the total revenue from real estate operations  and and  respectively  of real estate operating expenses 
critical accounting policies amortization of management contracts 
in the trust paid  for the general partner interest and absolute management control over five partneships 
the trust elected to amortize  on a straight line method  its cost to acquire its position over the ten year period during which the holders of limited partnership interests could elect not to exchange those interests for shares of beneficial interest of the trust  consequently  depreciation expense each year includes  for amortization of the acquisition costs 
carpet replacement policy 
from its inception in  the trust has consistently followed the practice of charging the cost to replace carpets in its apartment units to expense as incurred 
real estate operating expenses include costs to replace carpets of   and  for  and respectively 
an acceptable alternative method of accounting would be the capitalization of costs as incurred  followed by charges for depreciation over the estimated useful life of the carpet 
management believes that  due to the relatively short useful life of apartment carpets  the annual expense for replacements is not materially greater than would be the annual charges for depreciation had the carpets been capitalized when purchased 
results of operations compared with the preceding year  rental and related income from the trust s apartment operations decreased by while apartment operating expenses  exclusive of depreciation  increased by 
rental income from commercial properties decreased by from the previous year level

carpet and tile replacement costs increased by to provide rental incentive and to catch up from a lower than average expense level in the previous year 
maintenance and repairs increased by from the amount represented of gross pototential income  a level that management considers normal for the trust s portfolio 
real estate tax accruals for amounts estimated to be payable in increased by  or from comparable accruals in due to an indiana statewide reassessment of real property 
the trust  in its accruals in  underestimated by approximately  the amount of real estate tax payable in that underestimate was a charge against income in in addition to the amount accrued as an operating expense in for taxes payable in on site personnel costs  as a percent of gross possible income  were up from in to in  a increase 
rental income from commercial properties in decreased by  or  from the previous year  due to lower occupancy rates in lower real estate tax expense accounted for a decrease in operating expenses in compared with the previous year 
contrary to the significant increase in real estate taxes following reassessment of the apartment properties  each one of the commercial properties experienced lower assessed values and lower billings for taxes payable in mortgage interest expense for decreased by  from the amount reported for approximatly  of that decrease is attributable to lower interest rates on three mortgage loans that were refinanced in july  the balance of the decrease is attributed primarily to a reduction in mortgage loan balances that resulted from scheduled monthly debt service 
no mortgage loans were refinanced in looking ahead  management plans to refinance two mortgage loans in in the second quarter  a loan on one of the controlled partnership owned properties that had an unpaid balance of approximately million at december   is scheduled to be replaced with a new long term fixed rate loan with a lower interest rate 
the lower interest rate expected on the new loan is projected to reduce interest expense in its first year by approximately  the second mortgage loan to be refinanced in relates to an existing loan that will mature in october  with a balance due at maturity of approximately  management believes that amount is less than of the value of the property and that various financing options may be considered 
refinance plans for that loan will be finalized during the second quarter
