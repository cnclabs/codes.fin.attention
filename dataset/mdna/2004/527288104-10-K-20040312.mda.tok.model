the purchase price was approximately  including expenses  of which approximately  was provided by financing that is non recourse to the company but is fully collateralized by symphony s assets 
in addition  at acquisition  the lender provided an additional  of working capital financing to symphony 
as of december   symphony was not in compliance with a financial covenant contained in its  credit facility but had obtained a waiver from the lender that suspends application of the covenant until march  the company believes it is probable symphony will be in compliance with the covenant at that time  however  if it isn t in compliance the lender would have the right to accelerate the loan  outstanding at december  
the company has consolidated symphony s financial condition and results of operations since acquisition 
in september  the company acquired a interest in acres of unimproved land in washington  dc for cash of  immediately following the acquisition  mortgage financing of  was obtained  which is non recourse to the company  and which reduced the net cash investment in the property to  subsequent to the purchase  the mortgage lender provided an additional  of such non recourse financing  which further reduced the company s net cash investment 
the land is zoned for a minimum of  square feet of commercial office space  which the company intends to develop in phases  once acceptable tenants or purchasers are identified

of a leucadia common share for each share of wiltel common stock 
leucadia issued  of its common shares in exchange for all of the wiltel common stock that it didn t previously own 
the merger agreement also provided that wiltel stockholders receive contingent sale rights which entitle wiltel stockholders to additional leucadia common shares up to an aggregate maximum of  additional leucadia common shares if the company sells substantially all of wiltel s assets or outstanding shares of capital stock prior to october   or consummates such a sale at a later date if the sale agreement was entered into prior to august   and in either case the net proceeds exceed the valuation ascribed to wiltel s equity in the merger 
the aggregate purchase price for the acquisition was approximately  consisting of  of leucadia common shares and cash expenses of  the company has consolidated the financial condition and results of operations of wiltel from november   and it no longer accounts for its earlier investment in wiltel under the equity method of accounting 
as of december   the company s consolidated balance sheet includes total wiltel liabilities of approximately  including long term indebtedness of approximately  none of which has been guaranteed by the company

wiltel became a member of the company s consolidated federal income tax return as of november  wiltel has significant nols  substantially all of which are only available to reduce the federal taxable income of wiltel and its subsidiaries  and has substantial other tax attributes and future deductions primarily future depreciation deductions  some of which are also available to reduce the federal taxable income of the company and its other subsidiaries 
although the amount of these future deductions that can be used to reduce the federal taxable income of other members of the company s consolidated tax group is dependent upon the future taxable income of wiltel and its subsidiaries  the company does not expect it will have material federal income tax liabilities for the foreseeable future 
for more information about wiltel s nols and tax attributes  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in this report 
in december  the company purchased all of the debt obligations under the senior secured credit facility of atx for  and also entered into an amendment to the facility pursuant to which the company agreed to refrain from exercising certain of its rights under the facility  subject to certain conditions 
in january  atx commenced a voluntary chapter case in order to reorganize its financial affairs 
although the company has entered into a conversion agreement pursuant to which the senior secured debt of atx would be converted into of the equity securities of a reorganized atx  implementation of the conversion agreement is subject to bankruptcy court approval 
as of march   the company is authorized to repurchase  common shares 
such purchases may be made from time to time in the open market  through block trades or otherwise 
depending on market conditions and other factors  such purchases may be commenced or suspended at any time without prior notice 
at december   a maximum of  was available to the parent as dividends from its regulated subsidiaries without regulatory approval 
cash and investments aggregating  are held by non regulated subsidiaries that are parties to agreements which restrict the payment of dividends 
for more information concerning the long term debt of the company and its subsidiaries  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the parent also receives tax sharing payments from subsidiaries included in its consolidated income tax return  including certain regulated subsidiaries 
payments from regulated subsidiaries for dividends and tax sharing payments totaled  for the year ended december  consolidated liquidity in  net cash was used for operating activities  principally due to corporate overhead expenses  reduced investment income  an increase in the investment in the trading portfolio and a  contribution to the company s defined benefit pension plan 
in  net cash was provided by operating activities  principally as a result of a reduction to the company s investment in the trading portfolio 
in  net cash was provided by operating activities  principally related to distributions received from investments in associated companies 
as of december   wiltel had aggregate cash and investments of  excluding investments pledged as collateral  available for use in its operating  investing and financing activities 
substantially all of wiltel s assets have been pledged to secure its outstanding long term debt  principally to secure its obligations under its credit agreement  outstanding as of december  and its outstanding mortgage debt  outstanding at december  
under wiltel s credit agreement  which is non recourse to the company wiltel is required to make quarterly principal payments commencing in june until final maturity in september  aggregating  in and  in the wiltel credit agreement contains covenants which require wiltel to meet certain operating targets  which it currently meets  and restrictions which limit wiltel s ability to incur additional indebtedness  spend funds on capital expenditures and make certain investments 
the company currently expects that wiltel will be able to meet the operating targets required by its credit agreement during and  however  compliance with the operating targets thereafter is uncertain 
the agreement also prohibits wiltel from paying dividends to the company 
wiltel s mortgage debt which is non recourse to the company is comprised of two notes  one of which requires annual principal payments of approximately  per year until final maturity in an aggregate of 
the other note  with a balance due of  as of december   does not require any principal or interest payments until december  when all principal and accrued but unpaid interest is due an aggregate of while wiltel has no material contractual commitments for capital expenditures  it does plan to spend significant amounts each year  principally for network expansion  maintenance and product upgrades 
in addition  wiltel may also incur additional capital expenditures upon the acquisition of new customers or when providing new products to existing customers 
wiltel will use its available cash resources and operating profits to fund its capital expenditure needs 
wiltel is a party to various legal actions and claims  and has reserved  for the satisfaction of all litigation 
certain of these actions relate to the rights of way licensed to wiltel in connection with the installation of its fiber optic cable and seek damages from wiltel for failure to obtain all necessary landowner consents 
additional right of way claims may be asserted against wiltel 
the company does not believe that the ultimate resolution of all claims  legal actions and complaints will have a material adverse effect upon wiltel s results of operations  although unfavorable outcomes could significantly impact wiltel s liquidity 
based on the net cash flow currently generated by wiltel  the company does not expect that wiltel will have sufficient liquidity to meet all of the principal amortization requirements on its debt during wiltel has had and continues to have discussions with potential lenders and investment bankers concerning a refinancing of its credit agreement in order to extend principal amortization payments beyond the current due dates 
while these discussions are in the preliminary stages  the company believes that it will be able to refinance a substantial portion of wiltel s credit agreement debt  although the precise amount that can be refinanced  the new maturity and the cost is uncertain 
the company s consolidated banking and lending operations had outstanding loans net of unearned finance charges of  and  at december  and  respectively 
at december   were loans to individuals generally collateralized by automobiles  were loans to consumers  substantially all of which were collateralized by real or personal property  were loans to small businesses  and were unsecured loans 
the banking and lending segment is no longer making consumer loans  operating activities at this segment have been limited to maximizing the amount collected from its loan portfolio and liquidating the business in an orderly and cost efficient manner 
the banking and lending segment continues to have discussions with potential purchasers of its loan portfolios  although it has not yet accepted any offers 
these discussions are expected to continue 
these loans were primarily funded by deposits generated by the company s deposit taking facilities and by brokers  which totaled  and  as of december  and  respectively 
the cash flows generated from the collections on its loan portfolios have been used to retire these deposits as they matured 
in january  aib filed an application with the occ  the primary regulator of aib  to merge aif into aib 
in march  the occ approved aib s application for merger subject to aib submitting a written plan to the occ specifying the steps and timeframes aib will use to ensure an orderly liquidation of its operations 
the company expects that the merger will be completed during the second quarter of  and constitutes the next step in the liquidation of this segment 
this condition is consistent with aib s objectives  although aib will not be able to surrender its national bank charter and fully liquidate its operations until such time as all deposit liabilities have been repaid or sold 
aib has been reducing its deposit liabilities during the past two years  and is currently offering early withdrawal incentives  and may eventually sell remaining deposits to another institution 
certain subsidiaries of the company have nols and other tax attributes  the amount and availability of which are subject to certain qualifications  limitations and uncertainties 
in order to reduce the possibility that certain changes in ownership could impose limitations on the use of the nols  the company s certificate of incorporation contains provisions which generally restrict the ability of a person or entity from accumulating five percent or more of the common shares and the ability of persons or entities now owning five percent or more of the common shares from acquiring additional common shares 
the restrictions will remain in effect until the earliest of a december   b the repeal of section of the internal revenue code or any comparable successor provision or c the beginning of a taxable year of the company to which certain tax benefits may no longer be carried forward 
the company intends to seek shareholder approval to extend these restrictions 
as shown below  at december   the company s contractual cash obligations totaled  the company s debt instruments require maintenance of minimum tangible net worth  limit distributions to shareholders and limit indebtedness and funded debt as such terms are defined in the agreements 
in addition  the debt instruments contain limitations on investments  liens  contingent obligations and certain other matters 
the company is in compliance with all of these restrictions  and the company has the ability to incur additional indebtedness or make distributions to its shareholders and still remain in compliance with these restrictions 
certain of the debt instruments of subsidiaries of the company also contain restrictions which require the maintenance of financial covenants  impose restrictions on the ability to pay dividends to the company and or provide collateral to the lender 
for more information  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
payments due by period in thousands less than contractual cash obligations total year years years after years customer banking deposits     long term debt      operating leases  net of sublease income      asset purchase obligations    operations and maintenance obligations      other long term contractual obligations      total contractual cash obligations      material contractual obligations that are not included in the table above are the company s consolidated pension liability  and deferred revenue obligations 
deferred revenue obligations do not require the expenditure of material cash  and the timing of cash payments for the pension liability  if any  cannot be predicted 
off balance sheet arrangements at december   the company s off balance sheet arrangements consist of guarantees aggregating  the company s guarantee of of berkadia s financing incurred in connection with the berkadia loan represents  of that total  all of which expired as a result of the retirement of the berkadia loan in the first quarter of pursuant to an agreement that was entered into before the company sold cds holding corporation cds to homefed in  the company agreed to provide project improvement bonds for the san elijo hills project 
these bonds  which are primarily for the benefit of the city of san marcos  california  are required prior to the commencement of any development at the project 
cds is responsible for paying all third party fees related to obtaining the bonds 
should the city or others draw on the bonds for any reason  cds and one of its subsidiaries would be obligated to reimburse the company for the amount drawn 
at december   the amount of outstanding bonds was   of which expires in and the remainder expires in the company s remaining guarantees at december  are  of indemnifications given to lenders to certain real estate properties 
the amounts borrowed under the financings are reflected as long term debt in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
critical accounting estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates all of these estimates and assumptions 
the following areas have been identified as critical accounting estimates because they have the potential to have a material impact on the company s financial statements  and because they are based on assumptions which are used in the accounting records to reflect  at a specific point in time  events whose ultimate outcome won t be known until a later date 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
loan loss reserves the allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense 
as of december   the company s allowance for loan losses was  or of the related outstanding loan receivable balance of  the allowance for loan losses is an amount that the company believes will be adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in its portfolio based on the company s evaluations of the collectibility of loans as of the balance sheet date 
factors considered by the company include prior loan loss experience  current economic trends  aging of the loan portfolio and collateral value 
the amount recorded for the allowance for loan losses results from numerous judgments and assumptions that are made to estimate actual loan loss experience in the future 
in september  the company outsourced substantially all of its consumer loan servicing and collection functions to a third party service provider  in order to reduce overhead costs and convert these activities into a variable cost that declines as the size of the portfolio declines 
while expense savings were achieved  delinquency in each serviced portfolio increased during the first days after the transfer to the service provider  and has not returned to normal levels 
the company believes the deteriorating delinquency results from the service provider not dedicating adequate resources to the collection efforts  and it has been the company s experience that once accounts reach certain delinquency levels  a high percentage are eventually charged off 
as a result  the banking and lending segment recorded an additional provision for loan losses of  in although the company believes that the additional reserve is sufficient given the current level of delinquency in the portfolio  any further deterioration in delinquency could result in the need to record additional reserves 
changes in the economy in the future could also impact the amount of reserves required  as during periods of economic weakness  delinquencies  defaults  repossessions  bankruptcies and losses generally increase 
these periods are often also accompanied by decreased demand for and declining values of used automobiles securing outstanding loans  which weakens collateral coverage and increases the severity of loss in the event of default 
income taxes the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred taxes to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
historically  if the company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment would increase income in such period 
similarly  if the company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred taxes in the future  an adjustment would be charged to income in such period 
the company also records reserves for contingent tax liabilities related to potential exposure 
subsequent to the acquisition of all of the outstanding common stock of wiltel  wiltel became a member of the company s consolidated tax return 
as discussed above  wiltel has significant tax attributes  some of which are available to reduce the future taxable income of other members of the company s consolidated federal income tax return 
the company established a valuation allowance that fully reserved for all of wiltel s net deferred tax assets  reduced by an amount equal to the company s current and deferred federal income tax liabilities as of the date of acquisition see allocation of the purchase price in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
except as discussed in results of operations below  prior to recording any decrease to the valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset  the company will need to demonstrate that on a pro forma combined basis with wiltel  it will have had positive cumulative pre tax income over a period of years 
at that time  any decrease to the valuation allowance will be based significantly upon the company s assumptions and projections of its future income  which are inherently uncertain 
impairment of long lived assets the company evaluates its long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate  in management s judgment  that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
the determination of whether an impairment has occurred is based on management s estimate of undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the assets as compared to the carrying value of the assets 
if an impairment has occurred  the amount of the impairment recognized is determined by estimating the fair value for the assets and recording a provision for loss if the carrying value is greater than fair value 
as of december   the carrying amount of the company s investment in the mineral rights and mining properties of mk gold was approximately  the recoverability of this asset is entirely dependent upon the success of mk gold s mining project at the las cruces copper deposit in the pyrite belt of spain 
mining will be subject to obtaining required permits  obtaining both debt and equity financing for the project  engineering and construction 
the amount of financing that can be obtained for the project and its related cost will be significantly affected by the assessment of potential lenders of the current and expected future market price of copper 
in addition  the actual price of copper  the operating cost of the mine and the capital cost to bring the mine into production will affect the recoverability of this asset 
based on the current status of the project and mk gold s estimate of future financing costs and future cash flows  the company believes the carrying amount of its investment is recoverable 
however  if the company is unable to obtain the permits required to begin construction of the mine and commence mining activities  it is likely that this investment will be impaired 
as of december   the carrying amount of the company s investment in its manufacturing facility located in belgium was approximately  the belgium facility  which became operational in the third quarter of  has not yet achieved the level of revenues and profitability originally expected by the company  primarily due to the segment s loss of a major multi national customer and insufficient demand from other customers 
during  a new general manager was hired at the facility  and the company expects that new management s development and implementation of marketing and sales initiatives should significantly improve profitability 
based on the current business plan  which includes a budget for and estimates of revenue growth thereafter  the company believes that its investment in the belgium facility is recoverable 
however  the operation has remained in the start up phase for at least a year longer than anticipated  and if profitability improvement is not achieved  the carrying amount of the facility is likely to be impaired 
acquisition of wiltel in order to determine the fair values of wiltel s acquired assets and liabilities  the company utilized independent appraisals  principally for property and equipment and identifiable intangible assets  actuarial calculations for employee benefit obligations  market quotes  discounted cash flow techniques and comparable sales information to determine the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired 
significant judgments and estimates were also made to determine the fair values of certain liabilities  including liabilities for unfavorable contracts and deferred revenue  many of which required the company to make assumptions about the future 
the company has not completed all of the analyses and studies to finalize its allocation of the purchase price for the purchase 
the company expects to complete its allocation of the purchase price by the end of the third quarter of  and any changes from its initial allocation could affect the values assigned to property and equipment  intangible assets and trade payables  expense accruals and other liabilities 
however  the company does not expect that the impact of these changes will be material 
the company engaged independent appraisers to assist in its determination of the fair value of wiltel s property and equipment and identifiable intangible assets and in its allocation of the fair value to the various asset classes 
the methods used to determine the fair values included estimating wiltel s business enterprise value  utilizing both discounted cash flow and market comparable based approaches 
property and equipment assets also included an analysis of depreciated replacement cost and market prices 
the company and its appraisers considered several factors to determine the fair value of property and equipment  including local market conditions  recent fiber transactions in the market  the size  age  condition  utility and character of the property  the estimated cost to acquire comparable property if comparable property was available  the estimated cost to acquire new property  an estimate of depreciation from use and obsolescence  the remaining expected useful life of the assets and estimates of future network capacity utilization 
the aggregate replacement cost of new property and equipment was estimated to be approximately  this estimate was comprised of network construction costs of approximately  including rights of way  conduit and fiber and equipment that is part of the network of approximately  the remainder of the estimate was comprised of buildings and other equipment  which are not necessarily industry specific 
at the date of acquisition  the amount reflected in the consolidated balance sheet for property and equipment was intangible assets that were identified by the company to be analyzed for separate recognition in the allocation of the purchase price consisted of the vyvx tradename  specific contracts with specific customers and contractual and non contractual customer relationships 
the vyvx tradename is well recognized  and vyvx has a long operating history and is the market leader in its industry 
the company and its appraisers employed a royalty savings approach to estimate the value of the vyvx tradename 
in this approach  a hypothetical royalty rate  based on market licensing agreements  is used to estimate the long term economic benefits of the tradename under the assumption that it was not owned 
as of the date of acquisition  the amount reflected in the consolidated balance sheet for the vyvx tradename was  to determine the fair value of customer relationships  a discounted cash flow method was used  adjusted for contributory asset charges related to the use of tangible assets  working capital  the tradename and the workforce 
the cash flows were adjusted by an attrition factor to recognize that customer relationships are a wasting asset 
at the date of acquisition  the amount reflected in the consolidated balance sheet for customer relationships was  which primarily relates to vyvx customers 
since the aggregate fair values of the net assets acquired exceeded the purchase price  under gaap the company is required to apply the excess to reduce the initial fair values of certain non current assets on a pro rata basis 
wiltel s only significant non current assets were property and equipment and identifiable intangible assets  and wiltel s property and equipment represented over of the non current assets on a fair value basis 
the amount of the excess over the purchase price was significant  and substantially all of the excess was applied to reduce the fair value of wiltel s property and equipment and identified intangible assets 
therefore  the company does not believe that any reasonable changes in its assumptions and estimates used to determine the fair values of wiltel s assets would have had a material effect on its allocation of the purchase price 
however  if in the future wiltel s operating cash flows prove to be much less than projected  the company could find that either its property and equipment or identifiable intangible assets are impaired  which would result in a charge to earnings at that time 
to determine the fair value of deferred revenue  the company had to assess transactions having limited activity in the current telecommunications market environment 
the company considered market indicators related to pricing  pricing for comparable transactions  as well as the legal obligation of the company to provide future services 
the company also assumed it would continue to perform its contractual obligations through the term of its contracts 
revenue will be recognized on these contracts as services are performed  typically on a straight line basis over the remaining length of the contract 
in the future  if the company settles these obligations or they are otherwise terminated prior to completion of the performance obligation  the company would likely recognize a gain equal to the carrying amount of the obligation 
at the date of acquisition  the amount reflected in the consolidated balance sheet for deferred revenue was  the company evaluated the fair value of long term commitments that are either above or below the current market rates for similar transactions  and the fair value of telecommunications capacity commitments that are not required based on wiltel s current operating plans 
these commitments primarily consist of real estate leases and international capacity contracts 
in order to determine the fair values of these agreements  the company made significant assumptions concerning future market prices  future capacity utilization  the ability to enter into subleasing arrangements and that the commitments will not be terminated prior to their expiration dates 
as a result  at the date of acquisition the consolidated balance sheet reflects an accrual for unfavorable long term commitments of  determined on a present value basis 
this accrued liability will be amortized on a straight line basis over the life of the commitments 
results of operations in the future would be impacted by any subsequent adjustment to this liability  which could result from negotiating a termination or reduction of its contractual obligation with contract counter parties or sublease activity that is different from the company s original assumptions 
telecommunications revenue recognition capacity  transmission  video services and other telecommunications services revenues are recognized monthly as the services are provided or revenues are earned 
if at the time services are rendered  collection is not reasonably assured either due to credit risk  the potential for billing disputes or other reasons  revenue is not recognized until such contingencies are resolved 
wiltel estimates the amount of services which should not be recognized as revenue at the time the service is rendered based on its collection experience for each type of service 
certain of wiltel s customers represent such a high credit risk due to their difficult financial position that revenue is not recognized until cash is received 
in addition  wiltel knows from past experience that a certain percentage of its billings will be disputed and uses that experience to estimate the amount of expected disputes and defers recognition of revenue at the time the service is provided 
revenues that have not been recognized at the time service is provided are subsequently recognized as revenue when the amounts are collected 
contingencies the company accrues for contingent losses when the contingent loss is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
as of december   the company s consolidated balance sheet includes litigation reserves of  all of which relate to wiltel litigation 
estimating the ultimate outcome of litigation matters is inherently uncertain  in particular because the ultimate outcome will rest on events and decisions of others that may not be within the power of the company to control 
the company does not believe that any of these matters will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position  consolidated results of operations or liquidity 
however  if the amounts ultimately paid at the resolution of a litigation matter are significantly different than the company s recorded reserve amount  the difference could be material to the company s consolidated results of operations and  with respect to wiltel  settlement amounts are likely to be material to its liquidity 
results of operations telecommunications the following table reconciles wiltel s segment profit from operations to pre tax income loss for the period from the january  through november   and for the period from november  when wiltel became a consolidated subsidiary through december  prior to the merger the company did not consolidate wiltel  and for the period from january  through november  the company accounted for its share of wiltel s losses under the equity method of accounting 
since wiltel is only included in the company s consolidated results of operations for less than a two month period during  and since wiltel s revenues and expenses for a full year will be very significant to the company s consolidated statements of operations  the period prior to consolidation is shown below for information purposes only 
however  the amounts for the pre consolidation period are not included in the company s consolidated results of operations  and the two periods combined would not equal any amounts reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company has filed audited financial statements of wiltel for the period before the acquisition as financial statement schedules to this report 
january  november  through november  through december  network vyvx total wiltel network vyvx total wiltel in thousands operating revenues       segment profit from operations       depreciation and amortization expense       interest expense  net of investment income     other non operating income expense  net      pre tax income loss       excludes intersegment revenues from amounts billed by network to vyvx of  and  for the periods from january  through november  and november  through december   respectively 
these items have been allocated to each segment based upon a formula that considers each segment s revenues  property and equipment and headcount 
for the period from january  through november   includes  of settlement gains related to the termination of various agreements that released wiltel from previously accrued obligations  recoveries of previously written off receivables and a gain on the sale of a subsidiary  each of which result from transactions which management does not consider to be part of the current year s operating performance 
for wiltel s segments  segment profit from operations is the primary performance measure of segment operating results and profitability 
wiltel defines segment profit from operations as income before income taxes  interest expense  investment income  depreciation and amortization expense and other non operating income and expense 
since the time that wiltel first filed for bankruptcy protection in april  wiltel has been successful in reducing and controlling both its capital expenditures and operating costs 
wiltel has reduced its headcount from approximately  in april to  as of december  in addition to lower personnel costs  wiltel has reduced its expenses for leased capacity  and has successfully reduced selling  general and other expenses 
for the period from november  through december   consolidated amounts for wiltel include salaries expense of  and selling  general and other expenses of  during  each of wiltel s segments reported positive segment profits for the first time over a full year period 
while it continues to make efforts to control its costs  wiltel is seeking to acquire new customers to increase the profitability of both segments 
network s revenues include services provided to sbc of  for the period after consolidation by the company and  for the period prior to consolidation 
throughout  services provided to sbc grew  principally related to voice products 
the growth in voice revenue resulted from  in part  sbc s continued growth in long distance services in california and sbc s launch of long distance services in other states 
network cost of sales reflects the increase in revenues  primarily due to traffic related access and egress costs 
network s salaries and selling  general and other expenses during the period wiltel was consolidated by the company reflect reduced costs as a result of wiltel s restructuring efforts during the later part of and throughout for the period from november  through december   vyvx revenues and profitability reflect the holiday season  when new movie releases tend to increase volume in the advertising distribution business 
cost of sales reflects the level of revenues  while salaries and selling  general and other expenses include the benefit of cost reduction efforts implemented earlier in the year 
healthcare services prior to its acquisition by the company  the businesses operated by symphony were owned by a company undergoing reorganization proceedings under chapter of the bankruptcy code  which made it difficult for symphony to attract new customers 
since its acquisition in september  symphony has been focused on profitably growing its business and  because of the nature of its business  attracting and hiring skilled professionals to provide its services 
during the period the company has owned symphony  it entered into approximately new customer contracts  while substantially retaining existing profitable customers 
symphony also intends to look for strategic acquisitions to increase its customer base and pool of professional service providers  however  no assurance can be given that it will be successful in those efforts 
for the four month period from acquisition through december   the pre tax loss of the healthcare services segment was  during this period  healthcare services revenues were  and cost of sales  which primarily consist of salaries and employee benefits  were  legislative caps on part b medicare therapy  which negatively impacted symphony s revenues in  have been removed for and  and the fee schedule for such services has also been increased by

banking and lending as stated previously  the current activities of the banking and lending segment are limited to maximizing the amount collected from its loan portfolio while liquidating the business in an orderly and cost efficient manner 
as a result  revenues and expenses for this segment included in the company s consolidated statements of operations are reflective of the continuing decrease in the size of the loan portfolio 
pre tax income loss for the banking and lending segment was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
finance revenues  which reflect both the level and mix of consumer instalment loans  decreased in each of the last two years as compared to the prior period  as average loans outstanding were   and  during  and  respectively 
although finance revenues decreased in as compared to  pre tax results increased primarily due to a  reduction in interest expense  due to reduced customer banking deposits and lower interest rates thereon  a decline in the provision for loan losses of  less interest paid on interest rate swaps and lower salaries expense and operating costs resulting from the segment s restructuring efforts 
although finance revenues decreased in as compared to for the reasons described above  pre tax results increased primarily due to a  reduction in interest expense  due to reduced customer banking deposits and lower interest rates thereon  a net change of  in the accounting for the market values of interest rate swaps discussed below  a decline in the provision for loan losses of  and lower salaries expense and operating costs resulting from the segment s restructuring efforts 
although interest expense decreased in total  other expense does reflect higher interest paid on interest rate swaps of  for both and  the reduction in the provision for bad debts results from the decrease in the size of the consumer loan portfolios  although the reserve balance at the end of the year as a percent of gross loans has been increasing 
in addition  the company increased its allowance during the third quarter of by  as a result of an increase in delinquency  which shortly followed the outsourcing of loan collection activities

the company used interest rate swaps to manage the impact of interest rate changes on its customer banking deposits  all of the segment s interest rate swaps matured in although the company believes that these derivative financial instruments served as economic hedges  they did not meet certain effectiveness criteria under sfas and  therefore  were not accounted for as hedges 
manufacturing pre tax income for the manufacturing segment was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
although revenues increased by in  revenues declined in each of and as compared to the prior year 
revenues in all periods reflect the loss of certain customers to competitors on the basis of price  as well as lower prices charged by the division for certain product lines 
the plastics division is attempting to develop new products  applications and markets to replace its lost business and utilize its excess capacity 
in addition  the company has been focusing on reducing operating and overhead costs  improving service levels and reducing lead times 
the increase in manufacturing revenues in primarily resulted from increases in the construction and consumer products markets of  although revenues in the carpet padding and agricultural markets declined 
however  gross profit declined  as the increase in the price of resin  the primary raw material used in the manufacture of the segment s products  more than offset the revenue increase 
pre tax results improved due to lower salaries and selling  general and other expenses principally as a result of workforce reductions and other cost reduction programs  cash received from government grants and a gain from the sale of a line of business 
in addition  the impairment charge recorded in that is discussed below reduced pre tax results in that year 
manufacturing revenues for the plastics division declined approximately in as compared to primarily due to reductions in the consumer products market of  although revenues in the construction market increased by  the reductions in the consumer products market resulted from the loss of a customer for the asian market and for its consumer dust wipe products  and reduced demand for one of the company s healthcare products 
gross profit was largely unchanged for as compared to  reflecting cost reduction initiatives that reduced labor costs  improved material utilization and reduced non resin raw material costs 
for the year ended december   the division recorded an impairment charge of approximately  to write down the book value of certain production lines that the division does not expect will be utilized over the next several years 
these lines were initially purchased to provide additional capacity to produce a specific product for a specific customer  however  the customer discontinued the product in and the company no longer believes that the cost of these lines are currently recoverable from other business 
when the division s customer discontinued the product and terminated its contract in  it was required to pay the division a termination payment of  which was recognized as other income in the division did not record an impairment charge in since its expected production volume for these lines was anticipated to result in future cash flows that did not support an impairment charge at that time

pre tax results for the domestic real estate segment are largely dependent upon the performance of the segment s operating properties  the current status of the company s real estate development projects and non recurring gains or losses recognized when real estate assets are sold 
as a result  the results of operations for this segment in the aggregate for any particular year are not predictable and do not follow any consistent pattern 
revenues and pre tax results from domestic real estate increased in as compared to  primarily as a result of improved operating performance at the company s hawaiian hotel

 as discussed below 
the company established a valuation allowance that fully reserved for all of wiltel s net deferred tax assets  reduced by an amount equal to the company s current and deferred federal income tax liabilities as of the date of acquisition 
the company needed to establish the valuation allowance because  on a pro forma combined basis  the company is not able to demonstrate that it is more likely than not that it will be able to realize that asset 
subsequent to the acquisition of wiltel  any benefit realized from wiltel s deferred tax asset will reduce the valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset  however  that reduction is first applied to reduce the carrying amount of the acquired non current intangible assets of wiltel rather than reduce the income tax provision of any component of total comprehensive income 
as a result  the statement of operations includes a net income tax provision for the period subsequent to the acquisition of wiltel of  allocated to various components of income even though no federal income tax for that period is due 
as previously described  recording this tax provision resulted in a reduction of the valuation allowance which was applied to reduce the carrying amount of the acquired non current intangible assets 
any future realization of wiltel s deferred tax assets will continue to result in a reduction to the non current intangible assets until they are reduced to zero 
income tax expense for also includes the company s actual income tax expense for the period prior to the acquisition of wiltel  and a benefit for the favorable resolution of certain federal and state income tax contingencies for which the company had previously established reserves of  once the non current intangible assets are reduced to zero  the company does not expect it will reflect a net federal income tax expense or benefit for total comprehensive income in the aggregate until such time as the company is able to reduce its valuation allowance and recognize a net deferred tax asset 
each component of other comprehensive income may reflect either a federal income tax provision or benefit in future periods  depending upon the relative amounts of each component  however  in the aggregate for all components the company does not expect to report any net federal income tax expense or benefit for the foreseeable future 
income taxes for reflect the reversal of tax reserves aggregating  as a result of the favorable resolution of certain federal income tax contingencies 
income taxes for reflect a benefit of  for the favorable resolution of federal and state income tax contingencies

the company s share of these gains was approximately  subsequent to the merger in november  wiltel became a consolidated subsidiary of the company and the equity method of accounting was no longer applied 
the company did not record a deferred tax benefit for its share of wiltel s losses while applying the equity method as its ability to use the capital loss to reduce the tax due on capital gains in the future is uncertain

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following includes forward looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
the company s market risk arises principally from interest rate risk related to its investment portfolio  its borrowing activities and the banking and lending activities of certain subsidiaries 
the company s investment portfolio is primarily classified as available for sale  and consequently  is recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reflected in shareholders equity 
included in the company s investment portfolio are fixed income securities  which comprised approximately of the company s total investment portfolio at december  these fixed income securities are primarily rated investment grade or are us governmental agency issued or guaranteed obligations 
the estimated weighted average remaining life of these fixed income securities was approximately years at december  the company s fixed income securities  like all fixed income instruments  are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
the company s investment portfolio also includes its investment in wmig  carried at its aggregate market value of  this investment is approximately of the company s total investment portfolio  and its value is subject to change if the market value of the wmig stock rises or falls 
at december   fixed income securities comprised approximately of the company s total investment portfolio and had an estimated weighted average remaining life of years 
at december  and  the company s portfolio of trading securities was not material 
the company is subject to interest rate risk on its long term fixed interest rate debt 
generally  the fair market value of debt securities with a fixed interest rate will increase as interest rates fall  and the fair market value will decrease as interest rates rise 
the company s banking and lending operations are subject to risk resulting from interest rate fluctuations to the extent that there is a difference between the amount of the interest earning assets and the amount of interest bearing liabilities that are prepaid withdrawn  mature or reprice in specified periods 
the principal objectives of the company s banking and lending asset liability management activities are to provide maximum levels of net interest income while maintaining acceptable levels of interest rate and liquidity risk and to facilitate funding needs 
the company utilizes an interest rate sensitivity model as the primary quantitative tool in measuring the amount of interest rate risk that is present 
the model quantifies the effects of various interest rate scenarios on the projected net interest margin over the ensuing twelve month period 
derivative financial instruments  including interest rate swaps  may be used to modify the company s indicated net interest sensitivity to levels deemed to be appropriate based on risk management policies and the company s current economic outlook 
counterparties to such agreements are major financial institutions  which the company believes are able to fulfill their obligations  however  if they are not  the company believes that any losses are unlikely to be material 
the banking and lending operations did not have any derivative financial instruments at december  the following table provides information about the company s financial instruments used for purposes other than trading that are primarily sensitive to changes in interest rates 
for investment securities and debt obligations  the table presents principal cash flows by expected maturity dates 
for the variable rate notes receivable and variable rate borrowings  the weighted average interest rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at the reporting date 
for loans  securities and liabilities with contractual maturities  the table presents contractual principal cash flows adjusted for the company s historical experience and prepayments of mortgage backed securities 
for banking and lending s variable rate products  the weighted average variable rates are based upon the respective pricing index at the reporting date 
for money market deposits that have no contractual maturity  the table presents principal cash flows based on the company s historical experience and management s judgment concerning their most likely withdrawal behaviors 
for interest rate swaps  the table presents notional amounts by contractual maturity date
