item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes contained in item of this annual report on form k 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of a number of factors  including those set forth under item business risk factors that may affect results and elsewhere in this report 
we were founded in december from through  we devoted our efforts principally to building  marketing and selling our professional services capabilities and to research and development activities related to our software products 
beginning in  we began to focus on selling our software products 
to date  we have enhanced and released several versions of our products 
we market and sell our products worldwide through our direct sales force  systems integrators  technology alliances and original equipment manufacturers 
we derive our revenues from the sale of software product licenses and related services 
product license revenues are derived from the sale of software licenses of our products 
our software licenses are priced based on either the size of the customer implementation or site license terms 
services revenues are derived from fees for professional services  training and software maintenance and support 
professional services include implementation  custom application development and project and technical consulting 
we bill professional service fees primarily on a time and materials basis or in some cases  on a fixed price schedule defined specifically in our contracts 
software maintenance and support arrangements are priced based on the level of services provided 
generally  customers are entitled to receive software updates  maintenance releases as well as on line and telephone technical support for an annual maintenance fee 
training is billed as services are provided 
as of december  we had offices in the united kingdom  france  germany  italy  and the united states and sales personnel located in spain 
revenues from customers outside the united states accounted for of our total revenues in  in and in critical accounting policies and estimates this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  the allowance for doubtful accounts  research and development costs  restructuring expenses  the impairment of long lived assets and income taxes 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience  known trends or events and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment 
revenue recognition not only is revenue recognition a key component of our results of operations  the timing of our revenue recognition also determines the timing of certain expenses  such as commissions 
in measuring revenues  we follow the specific guidelines of sop  software revenue recognition and sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
sop requires that four 
table of contents basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists via a signed license agreement  physical or electronic delivery has occurred including the availability of license keys or services rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable representing amounts that are due unconditionally with no future obligations under customary payment terms  and collectibility is probable 
in addition  revenue results are difficult to predict and any shortfall or delay in recognizing revenue could cause our operational results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and could result in future operating losses 
in accordance with sop and sop  revenues from software product license agreements are recognized upon execution of a license agreement and delivery of the software  provided that the fee is fixed or determinable and deemed collectible by management 
if conditions for acceptance are required subsequent to delivery  revenues are recognized upon customer acceptance if such acceptance is not deemed to be perfunctory 
in multiple element arrangements  we use the residual value method in accordance with sop and sop revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements which qualify for separate element accounting treatment is allocated to each undelivered element using the relative fair values of those elements based on vendor specific objective evidence with the remaining value assigned to the delivered element  the software license 
typically our software licenses do not include significant post delivery obligations to be fulfilled by us and payments are due within a three month period from the date of delivery 
consequently  license fee revenue is generally recognized when the product is shipped 
revenues from software maintenance agreements are recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance period  which is typically one year 
we enter into reseller arrangements that typically provide for sublicense fees payable to us based upon a percentage of our list price 
revenues are recognized under reseller agreements as earned for guaranteed minimum royalties  or based upon actual sales by the resellers 
we do not grant our resellers the right of return or price protection 
revenues from professional service arrangements are recognized as the services are performed  provided that amounts due from customers are fixed or determinable and deemed collectible by management 
amounts collected prior to satisfying the above revenue recognition criteria are reflected as deferred revenue 
unbilled services represent service revenues that have been earned by us in advance of billings 
deferred revenue primarily consists of advance payments related to support and maintenance and service agreements 
we principally recognize professional services revenues on a time and material basis 
from time to time we enter into fixed price service arrangements 
in those circumstances in which services are essential to the functionality of the software  we apply the percentage of completion method  and in those situations when only professional services are provided  we apply the proportional performance method 
both of these methods require that we track the effort expended and the effort expected to complete a project 
the most significant assumption by management in accounting for this type of arrangement is the estimated time to complete the project 
significant deviations in actual results from management s estimates with respect to one or more projects could significantly impact the timing of revenue recognition and could result in significant losses on these projects 
to date  our actual results in completing projects have not deviated significantly from management s estimates of the time to complete those projects 
accounts receivable and bad debt we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and determine the allowance for doubtful accounts based upon historical experience and specific customer collection issues 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances would be required 
research and development costs we account for research and development costs in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for research and development costs fas  and fas  accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed fas  which specifies that costs 
table of contents incurred internally to develop computer software products should be charged to expense as incurred until technological feasibility is reached for the product 
once technological feasibility is reached  all software costs should be capitalized until the product is made available for general release to customers 
judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility is established 
we believe that the time period from reaching technological feasibility until the time of general product release is very short 
costs incurred after technological feasibility is reached are not material  and accordingly  all such costs are charged to research and development expense as incurred 
restructuring expenses during  and  we recorded net restructuring benefits charges of million  million and million  respectively  pertaining to the closure and consolidation of excess facilities  impairment of assets as discussed below  employee severance benefits and settlement of certain contractual obligations 
these charges and benefits were recorded in accordance with fas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  fas  employers accounting for settlements and curtailments of defined benefit pension plans and for termination benefits and staff accounting bulletin  and sab   restructuring and impairment charges 
the and charges were recorded in accordance with emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring  fas  and sab in determining the charges to record  we made certain estimates and judgments surrounding the amounts ultimately to be paid for the actions we have taken 
at december   there are various accruals recorded for the costs to exit certain facilities and lease obligations  which may be adjusted periodically for either resolution of certain contractual commitments or changes in estimates of sublease income or the period of time the facilities will be vacant and subleased 
although we do not anticipate additional significant changes to our restructuring accruals  the actual costs may differ from those recorded in the event that the subleasing assumptions require adjustment due to changes in economic conditions surrounding the real estate market or we terminate our lease obligations prior to the scheduled termination dates 
such changes had a material impact to our operating results in and could have a material impact on our operating results in the future 
in order to estimate the costs related to our restructuring efforts  management made its best estimates of the most likely expected outcomes of the significant actions to accomplish the restructuring 
these estimates principally related to charges for excess facilities and included estimates of future sublease income  future net operating expenses of the facilities  brokerage commissions and other expenses 
the most significant of these estimates related to the timing and extent of future sublease income that would reduce our lease obligations 
included in our accrued restructuring balance at december  was estimated sublease income of 
million  net of adjustments 
we based our estimates of sublease income on  among other things  a opinions of independent real estate experts  b current market conditions and rental rates  c an assessment of the time period over which reasonable estimates could be made  d the status of negotiations with potential subtenants and e the locations of the facilities 
these estimates  together with other estimates made by us in connection with the restructuring actions  may vary significantly from the actual results  depending in part on factors beyond our control 
for example  the actual results will depend on our success in negotiating with lessors  the time periods required for us to locate and contract suitable subleases and the market rental rates at the time of such subleases 
adjustments to the facilities reserve may be required if actual lease settlement costs or sublease income differ from the amounts previously estimated 
we review the status of our restructuring activities on a quarterly basis and  if appropriate  record changes to our restructuring obligations in our financial statements for such quarter based on management s then current estimates 
impairment or disposal of long lived assets we review our long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying amount to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate 
if such assets are considered impaired  the impairment to be recognized is equal to the amount by which the carrying value of 
table of contents the assets exceed their fair market value determined by either a quoted market price  if any  or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique 
in assessing recoverability  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and discount factors 
if these estimates or related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges 
as a result of our restructuring activities in  and  we evaluated the realizability of our long lived assets including fixed assets and leasehold improvements related to our restructured facility leases and intangible assets consisting primarily of unamortized goodwill 
in and  we determined that  and million  respectively  of furniture and fixtures  computer equipment and software were impaired as a result of our decision to abandon the assets because of the termination of employees and related closures of offices in our  and restructuring plans 
these assets are no longer being used or will not be used in the future upon completion of the restructuring activities 
in addition  in and we deemed  and  respectively  of leasehold improvements to be impaired due to exiting certain office locations  and the estimated sublease income was not sufficient to recover the assets carrying value 
in  we determined that million of leasehold improvements and million of furniture  fixtures and equipment were impaired as a result of these restructured operating leases 
in addition we determined that approximately  and million in and  respectively  of purchased software was impaired due to our revised product development strategy 
lastly we wrote off the remaining unamortized goodwill of million due to the closure and abandonment of two professional service acquisitions completed in fiscal year accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for income taxes fas which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
fas also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we evaluate quarterly the realizability of our deferred tax assets and adjust the amount of such allowance  if necessary 
at december  and  we have provided a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of their realizability 
in addition  we have provided for potential amounts due in various foreign tax jurisdictions 
judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax expense provision 
in the ordinary course of global business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of cost reimbursement arrangements among related entities 
although we believe our estimates are reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
such differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made 
in the fourth quarter of we reversed previously accrued taxes of  for foreign locations due to a change in our estimates of potential amounts due in those locations

product license revenues generated from international customers decreased to million in from million in product license revenues as a percentage of total revenues for  and were  and  respectively 
we expect this percentage to increase to between and in our resellers generally receive a discount from our list prices 
the extent of any discount is based on negotiated contractual agreements between us and the reseller 
we do not grant our resellers the right of return  price protection or favorable terms 
we rely upon resellers to market and sell our products to governmental entities and to customers in geographic regions where it is not cost effective for us to reach end users directly 
we have approximately active resellers 
no single reseller generates a significant amount of our total revenues 
the table below sets forth product revenues recognized from reseller arrangements for the years ended  and reseller revenues of product revenues services revenues services revenues decreased to million in from million in the decrease was attributable to decreased services volume associated with decreased software license revenues as well as a reduction in our services capacity as we reduced headcount in professional services 
we expect services revenues to be flat to slightly higher in and to remain about the same as a percentage of total revenues 
support and maintenance revenues were of total services revenues in as compared to in support revenues  in absolute dollars  were slightly lower during due primarily to declining product revenues  partially offset by successful maintenance renewal and reinstatement efforts during we expect 
table of contents support and maintenance revenues to remain flat in this is due to increases from new maintenance revenues associated with expected increased product revenues offset by a portion of existing customers terminating their support coverage 
services revenues decreased to million in from million in the decrease was primarily attributable to the slowing economy  reduced information technology spending  declining product revenues and a reduction in our services capacity as we increased our use of system integrators on service engagements 
additionally  as a result of lower product sales  support and maintenance revenues have decreased 
support and maintenance revenues were of total service revenues in as compared to in however  the increase in absolute dollars from to was only  support revenues were higher during due to additional support required by customers migrating to newer versions of atg products 
services revenues as a percentage of total revenues for  and were  and  respectively 
cost of product license revenues cost of product license revenues includes salary and related benefits costs of fulfillment and engineering staff dedicated to maintenance of products that are in general release  the amortization of licenses purchased in support of and used in the company s products and royalties paid to vendors whose technology is incorporated into our products 
cost of product license revenues decreased to million in from million in this decrease was primarily related to lower product revenues and a decline in amortization of million related to the broadvision settlement due to the expiration of amortization as of december  in february  we settled a lawsuit filed by broadvision in december  which alleged that we were infringing on a patent for a method of conducting electronic commerce 
in connection with the settlement agreement  we agreed to pay broadvision a total of million for a perpetual license 
of this amount  we recognized million in in cost of product license revenues as a settlement for historical use of the technology  and we recorded the remaining million as a perpetual license to use the patented technology in our products in the future 
we amortized this asset over an estimated remaining useful life of three years 
as a result  cost of product license revenues includes amortization expense of approximately million in each of and the estimated useful life of the perpetual license ended on december   and we therefore did not record any cost of product license revenues related to the broadvision settlement in the decline in cost of product license revenues was partially offset by an increase in royalty fees of approximately  payable to original equipment manufacturers and  to reduce the carrying value of third party software embedded into one of our products based on expected net future cash flows to be generated from this software 
we expect cost of product license revenues to remain flat or decrease slightly in as compared with in  we recorded a charge in cost of product license of  to reduce the carrying value of third party software embedded into one of our products  which is a minor component of our suite of products  to its net realizable value of  based on management s best estimate of future net cash flows to be generated from the sale of the software to customers 
we have discontinued marketing of this software and have ceased future development work specifically related to this third party software 
however  we have not changed our overall product strategy for the purpose for which the software was acquired 
we are in discussions with other vendors  but do not expect this change to impact our future product offering 
cost of product license revenues decreased to million in from million in this decrease is primarily related to an impairment charge of approximately million recorded in related to purchased software to write the asset down to its net realizable value of zero 
the write down was due to a change in our product development strategy 
the software had no alternative future use 
the remainder of the decrease in cost of product license revenues was primarily attributable to lower product revenues 
for  
table of contents approximately half of our cost of product license revenues related to the broadvision settlement that was fully paid as of december  for  and  cost of product license revenues as a percentage of total revenues was  and  respectively 
we anticipate the cost of product license revenues  as a percentage of total revenues  to be between and in gross margin on product license revenues for  and  gross margin on product license revenues were  or million   or million  and  or million 
the increase in gross margin percentage from to was attributed to the expiration of amortization related to the broadvision perpetual license  which was fully amortized by the end of the decrease in gross margin from to was related primarily to the impairment charge to write down purchased software of approximately million and lower product revenues 
cost of services revenues cost of services revenues includes salary and other related costs for our professional services and technical support staff  as well as third party contractor expenses 
cost of services revenues will vary significantly from year to year depending on the level of professional services staffing  the effective utilization rates of our professional services staff  the mix of services performed  including product license technical support services  the extent to which these services are performed by us or by third party contractors and the level of third party contractor fees 
cost of services revenues decreased to million in from million in the decrease was primarily attributable to a reduction in our professional services workforce as a result of lower product license and services revenues 
approximately of the decrease was attributable to decreased compensation costs due to a reduction in our work force

we anticipate the cost of services revenues  as a percentage of total revenues  to be in the to range in gross margin on services revenues for  and  gross margin on services revenues were  or million   or million and  or million 
the increase in gross margin is attributed primarily to the increase in support and maintenance revenue as a percentage of total services revenue  increased utilization rates and a decrease in our professional services workforce and operating expenses 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist primarily of salary and related costs to support product development 
to date  all software development costs have been expensed as research and development in the period incurred 
research and development expenses decreased to million in from million in the decrease was primarily attributable to reductions in our workforce

due to cost reduction initiatives we anticipate that research and development expenses will trend lower as a percentage of total revenues and in absolute dollars in sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and other related costs for sales and marketing personnel  travel  public relations and marketing materials and events 
sales and marketing expenses decreased to million in from million in the decrease is primarily attributable to cost saving initiatives that resulted from a reduction of our sales and marketing group

however sales and marketing expenses can fluctuate as a percentage of total revenues depending on economic conditions  program spending  the rate at which new sales personnel become productive and the level of revenue 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs for operations and finance employees and legal and accounting fees 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million in from million in approximately of the decrease was related to a decrease in headcount and related expenses  with the remainder related to a decrease in professional services partially offset by an increase in recruiting  hiring and training 
we expect general and administrative expenses to decline as a percent of revenues in general and administrative expenses decreased to million in from million in approximately of the decrease was related to decreases in compensation and benefit costs  and of the decrease was related to a reduction in our professional fees 
approximately of the decrease was attributed to a decrease in recruiting  hiring  travel  training and direct office expenses while approximately of the decrease was related to a decrease in our provision for doubtful accounts due to favorable collections experience resulting in changes in our estimates of required reserves

due to cost reduction initiatives we anticipate that general and administrative expenses will trend lower as a percentage of total revenues and in absolute dollars in 
table of contents restructuring benefit charges as of december   we had an accrued restructuring liability of million  of which million related to restructuring charges  million related to restructuring charges  and million related to restructuring charges 
the long term portion of the accrued restructuring liability was million 
we believe our restructuring efforts have resulted in a cost structure that aligns us with current market opportunities and reflects changes in our product and geographic focus 
we expect to fund the payments for our restructuring accruals by use of our current cash and marketable securities and from resources generated from our future operations 
we do not believe that the restructuring actions have impaired our ability to produce competitive products in a timely fashion 
all of our restructuring actions were completed by december  we expect the activities to result in aggregate annual reductions in cost of revenues  sales and marketing  research and development and general and administrative expenses of to million 
during the years ended  and  we recorded net restructuring charges benefits of million  million and million  respectively  as a result of the global slowdown in information technology spending 
the charges primarily pertain to the closure and consolidation of excess facilities  impairment of assets  employee severance benefits and settling of certain contractual obligations 
the charges were recorded in accordance with fas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  fas  employers accounting for settlements and curtailments of defined benefit pension plans and for termination benefits fas and staff accounting bulletin sab  restructuring and impairment charges

in the second quarter of we recorded a restructuring charge of million  and in the fourth quarter of we recorded a restructuring charge of million 
in connection with these actions  we also recorded an impairment charge in cost of product licenses for purchased software of million 
total restructuring charges for totaled million 
a summary of the charges and subsequent adjustments of the restructuring accruals is as follows in thousands adjustments in adjustments accrued estimates in estimates restructuring resulting in resulting in write offs and balance as of charges additional charges credits payments december  facilities related costs and impairments employee severance  benefits and related costs asset impairments exchangeable share settlement marketing costs legal and accounting total

the facilities related charges comprise excess rental space for offices worldwide  net of estimates for vacancy periods and sublease income based on then current real estate market data  and related write offs of abandoned leasehold improvements and fixed assets of million and million  respectively  which were directly related to the excess office facilities 
the estimated sublease income was million based on rental rates ranging from to per square foot with estimated vacancy periods prior to the expected sublease income ranging from to months 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded an adjustment to increase the facility related costs for a change in estimate of the lease obligations for two leases by million as a result of a market analysis indicating lower sublease rates and longer vacancy periods due to the continued weakening of the real estate market 
the sublease income was adjusted by decreasing anticipated sublease rates from the range of to to the range of to per square foot and extending the initial vacancy periods by approximately months 
in addition  we reduced our lease accruals by million for a lease settlement in consideration of a buy out totaling million  which is being paid ratably over years 
during  we recorded an adjustment to increase the facilities related portion of the charge by an additional million for changes to sublease and vacancy assumptions due to the continued weakening in the real estate market 
the sublease income was adjusted by decreasing two anticipated sublease rates to from per square foot and extending the initial vacancy periods by months 
these changes resulted in an estimated reduction of sublease income of million 
in addition  during  we executed sublease agreements for two locations and recorded a reduction to our lease accruals of  due to favorable sublease terms compared to our original estimates 
during  we settled million of future lease obligations and related operating expenses for five leases for aggregate payments of million  resulting in an aggregate reduction to our lease accruals relating to our restructuring activities of million  net of sublease and vacancy assumptions 
we also 
table of contents recorded an additional charge of million for facilities related costs  comprising million for updated management assumptions of probable settlement outcomes based on the then current negotiations and  for updated sublease assumptions based on current real estate market conditions extending the vacancy period to months from months 
the leaseholds improvements  which will continue to be in use  related to the facilities we vacated and are subleasing or attempting to sublease  were written down to their estimated fair value of zero because the estimated cash flows to be generated by sublease income at those locations is not and will not be sufficient to recover the carrying value of the assets 
furniture and fixtures were written down to their fair value based on the expected discounted cash flows they will generate over their remaining economic life 
because these assets ceased being used as of the end of the period in which the write downs were recorded  the fair value of these assets was estimated to be zero 
the assets were abandoned and disposed of at the time of the charge 
employee severance  benefits and related costs and exchangeable shares as part of the restructuring actions  we recorded charges of million for the employee severance cost component 
we terminated the employment of employees  or of our workforce  none of whom remained employed as of june  approximately of these employees were from sales and marketing  from services  from general and administrative and from research and development 
in addition  we settled  exchangeable shares with a certain employee  who was terminated in connection with the restructuring action and recorded million as a charge to restructuring for this settlement 
during  we recorded additional charges of  for severance related to a specific employee terminated as part of the restructuring action 
asset impairments the asset impairment charges included the write off of approximately million of the remaining unamortized goodwill related to the two professional service organizations acquisitions completed in we closed these operations and terminated the employees as part of the restructuring action  and as a result  the unamortized goodwill was impaired and had no future value 
in addition  we recorded an impairment charge of approximately million in cost of product license revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations related to purchased software to record the software at its net realizable value of zero due to atg abandoning a certain product development strategy 
the purchased software had no future utility to us 
marketing costs and legal and accounting we recorded charges of  to write off certain prepaid costs for future marketing services to their fair value of zero due to changes in our product development strategy 
as a result  the prepaid marketing cost had no future utility to us 
during  we unexpectedly were able to recoup  and record a credit for the amount received 
during  we also recorded  for legal and accounting services incurred in connection with the restructuring action 
the actions were substantially completed by february  actions actions taken by us in included the consolidation and closure of excess facilities  a worldwide workforce reduction and the write off of certain idle assets 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a restructuring charge million

these charges included million for operating lease obligations  net of assumptions for vacancy periods and sublease income based on then current real estate market data  for office space that was either idle or vacated during the first quarter of this action was completed by january  this charge also included the write off of leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures associated with these facilities of  and  respectively  and computer equipment and software of  the lease charge was for office space we vacated and intend to sublease 
the estimated sublease income was million and was based on rental rates ranging from to per square foot with estimated vacancy periods prior to the expected sublease income ranging from to months 
during  we recorded an adjustment of million primarily to increase our lease obligation accrual at two locations for changes in the assumptions of the vacancy period and sublease income 
the sublease income was adjusted by decreasing anticipated sublease rates to from per square foot for one facility and from to per square foot at the other location 
we also extended the initial vacancy periods from to months to to months 
these changes resulted in an estimated reduction of sublease income of million 
in addition  principally due to a favorable lease settlement relating to our restructuring activities  we reduced our lease obligations by million 
the settlement resulted in us terminating million of future lease obligations and related operating expenses for an aggregate payment of million  which was paid in january  as a result of this transaction  we recorded prepaid rent of million increasing the accrual adjustments to million 
as a result of this action and the actions taken in  we wrote off certain computer equipment and software  aggregating  and furniture and fixtures  aggregating  which were no longer being used due to the reduction in personnel and office locations 
these assets were abandoned and written down to their fair value based on the expected discounted cash flows they would generate over their remaining economic life 
due to the short remaining economic life and current market conditions for such assets  the fair value of these assets was estimated to be zero 
these assets ceased being used either as of december  or in the first quarter of and were disposed of in the quarter ended march  in addition  we wrote off leasehold improvements  which will continue to be in use  related to the facilities we are attempting 
table of contents to sublease to their estimated fair value of zero because the estimated cash flows to be generated by sublease income at those locations will not be sufficient to recover the carrying value of the assets

during the fourth quarter of  we reduced certain severance accruals by  primarily at our foreign locations  primarily as a result of amounts being settled below the recorded amounts due to the impact of movements in foreign currency 
actions as a result of several reorganization decisions  we undertook plans to restructure operations in the second and third quarters of actions taken by us included the closure of excess facilities  a worldwide workforce reduction and the write off of certain idle assets

remaining vacancy periods as of december  vary from months to months depending upon rentable square feet in the local market and recent vacancy histories 
rental assumptions or sublease start dates may vary considerably from the above assumptions  which could cause us to take an additional charge 
if the estimated sublease dates were to be extended by six months  based on our current estimates  we would potentially have to recognize an additional  in our statement of operations for restructuring and other related charges

table of contents quarter of we are required to maintain million in unrestricted cash at the bank 
in the event our cash balances at the bank fall below million  we will be required to pay fees and expenses to compensate the bank for lost income 
at december   we were in compliance with all related financial covenants 
in the event that we do not comply with any of the financial covenants within the line of credit or we default on any of its provisions  the bank s significant remedies include declaring all obligations immediately due and payable  ceasing to advance money or extend credit for our benefit  applying to the obligations any balances and deposits held by us or any amount held by the bank owing to or for the credit of our account  and  putting a hold on any deposit account held as collateral 
if the agreement expires or is not extended  the bank will require outstanding letters of credit  or lc s  at that time to be cash secured on terms acceptable to the bank

of that total  million has been paid in and a final payment of  is scheduled to be made on april  we believe that there will not be any material real estate lease settlements beyond those completed to date 
as such  we believe that our balance of million in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities at december   along with other working capital and cash generated by our operations will allow us to meet our liquidity needs over the next twelve months 
however  our actual cash requirements will depend on many factors  including particularly  overall economic conditions both domestically and abroad 
we may seek additional external funds through public or private securities offerings  strategic alliances or other financing sources 
there can be no assurance that if we seek external funding  it will be available on favorable terms  if at all

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we maintain an investment portfolio consisting mainly of investment grade money market funds and corporate and government obligations with a weighted average maturity of less than one year 
marketable securities are classified as held to maturity and are recorded on the balance sheet at amortized cost  which approximates fair market value 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk  however  a change in interest rates would not have a material impact to the fair values of these securities primarily due to their short maturity and our intent to hold the securities to maturity 
the majority of our operations are based in the us  and accordingly  the majority of our transactions are denominated in us dollars 
however  we have foreign based operations where transactions are denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to market risk with respect to fluctuations in the relative value of currencies 
relative to foreign currency exposures existing at december   a movement in foreign exchange rates would not expose us to significant gains or losses in earnings or cash flows 
we may use derivative instruments to manage the risk of exchange rate fluctuations 
at december   we did not hold any foreign currency derivative instruments 
we do not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes
