item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview in  demand for information technology it services  such as those we provide  continued to be adversely impacted by the continuing economic uncertainties  fundamental changes in the it services industry and a decline in corporate capital sending for information technology projects 
as a result  our revenues continued to decline and our quarterly revenues have declined for ten consecutive quarters 
the results of our operations are affected by general economic conditions as well as the level of economic activity and changes in the industries the we serve 
while there have been some indications that the general economy and the it consulting services market is improving  we did not experience an increase in demand for our services during and there is no assurance that these improving conditions will result in an increase in our future revenues given the fundamental changes in the it service industry as set forth below 
in addition  increases in demand for our services generally tend to lag behind economic cycles 
accordingly  the benefit to our business of any economic recovery may take longer to realize 
as a result of the difficult economic environment and the resulting depressed market conditions  we implemented changes during the quarter ended june  as more fully described further in this section 
in making these changes  we made decisions to maintain our project personnel headcount at a level we believe is necessary to enable us to grow our business  invest in a range of specialty services that address targeted industry and business concerns in order to differentiate us from our competition and invest in marketing initiatives to support these specialty services 
we believe that partially as a result of these efforts  our quarterly revenues in the first quarter of will not decline as compared to the fourth quarter of  the first sequential quarter without a decline since the quarter ended june  we incurred operating losses in all four quarters during and we will likely continue to incur operating losses during as we take steps to refocus and rebuild our business 
in addition to the challenges presented by the difficult economic environment  we also believe that the information technology services industry is undergoing some fundamental changes  resulting in increased competitive pressure 
these changes include competition from application software firms as they continue to enhance services and implementation capabilities to increase their revenue  offshore application development and system consulting and support firms which typically have much lower labor costs and billing rates  and the proliferation of enterprise resource planning erp expertise within the it departments of organizations  reducing the need to engage outside consulting help 
this increase in the supply of trained personnel is expected to result in continued pressure on billing rates and margins  even as the overall economic climate improves and demand for it services recovers 
partially as a result of this increased competition and resulting pricing pressures  our average hourly billing rate decreased by percent in our business is also driven by the pace of technological change  our ability to differentiate ourselves from our competitors through specialty services that address targeted industry and business concerns  and the type and level of spending by our clients in the areas in which we page 
table of contents provide services 
many factors can result in a deferral  reduction or cancellation of services requested by our prospective or current clients including budget constraints  economic conditions and perceived project progress  success or value 
the economic uncertainties of recent years has lead many corporations to reassess their it goals and budgets 
this  combined with the lack of significant new technology to stimulate spending  has had a further dampening impact on demand for our services 
during periods of decreased demand  pricing pressures emerge as companies try to minimize costs and negotiate lower prices for our services 
our ability to successfully identify and prepare for these changes is a key driver of our performance 
therefore  our strategy is to try to anticipate these trends and identify cost management initiatives that will allow us to manage costs relative to expected revenues as well as identifying opportunities to increase revenues 
although we remain committed to spending our funds wisely  there is a point at which further cost cutting can be counter productive 
as a result of the continued reduced demand for our services  we implemented business and organizational changes during the quarter ended june  these changes  which resulted in a pre tax charge of million  included the resignation and replacement of both our chairman of the board and our chief executive officer and the rightsizing of our capacity pursuant to our reduction in work force program to better align it with our current and anticipated near term demand including personnel terminations and office reductions  while not compromising our ability to grow our business 
the pre tax charge also included professional fees incurred in connection with terminated negotiations with a party that had expressed interest in acquiring us 
project personnel costs constitute the majority of our operating costs 
since project personnel costs are driven primarily by the cost of billable personnel  mainly compensation and benefits  maintaining these costs at a reasonable and predictable percentage of revenue is critical to our financial performance 
project personnel costs as a percentage of revenues are driven by utilization and average hourly billing rates 
utilization represents the percentage of time our billable professionals spend on billable work 
it is our strategy to try to match our project personnel supply with demand 
at times this requires us to reduce headcount and reassign employees to other active projects when they are no longer needed on a particular project 
however  because of the mix of skills needed and project duration  implementation of this strategy may be delayed at times 
accordingly  any decline in revenues without a corresponding and timely reduction in staffing  or a staffing increase that is not accompanied by a corresponding increase in revenues  could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
segments during  we were organized into two business segments  digital enterprise consulting and peer in  we terminated the investment in and closed our peer software development operation within the peer segment and now we report entirely within one business segment 
page 
table of contents revenues for presentation purposes  we show two components of revenues revenues before reimbursements  which consists of revenue for performing consulting services  and reimbursements  consisting of reimbursements we receive from clients for out of pocket expenses incurred 
we believe revenues before reimbursements is a more meaningful representation of our economic activity since it excludes pass through  zero margin expense reimbursements 
costs and expenses project personnel project personnel costs consist primarily of professional salaries and benefits 
other project expenses other project expenses consist of the cost for subcontractors hired for use on our client projects and billed to our clients  employee termination costs  and nonbillable expenses incurred for client projects and business development 
nonbillable expenses include recruiting fees  certain selling expenses  and personnel training 
reimbursable expenses reimbursable expenses represent project related and other out of pocket expenses that are reimbursable by the client 
an equivalent amount is included in revenues under the caption reimbursements 
bad debt expense we maintain an allowance for doubtful receivables resulting from the failure of our customers to make required payments 
we also analyze our notes receivable  which are included in long term receivables and other on our consolidated balance sheet 
management and administrative support management and administrative support costs consist of practice area costs and infrastructure costs 
practice area costs include practice area management  support personnel  marketing costs and recruiting costs 
infrastructure costs include senior corporate management and our board of directors  accounting  financial reporting  finance  tax  legal  treasury  human resources  employee benefits  marketing  public and investor relations  office operations  staffing of our project personnel  recruiting  training  internal communications  internal technology applications  management of new business opportunities  planning  quality assurance  and risk management 
incentive compensation incentive compensation  if any  is accrued at a set percentage of base salary  which varies by level of employee  and adjusted to reflect the amounts needed for active employees and for performance against targets  goals and objectives 
payments of incentive compensation  if any  are performance based and are determined by both objective financial based and subjective measures 
these objectives include both quarterly and full fiscal year parameters 
page 
table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements  in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and other assumptions  which it believes are reasonable 
if actual amounts are ultimately different from these estimates  the revisions are included in the company s results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known 
accounting policies are considered critical when they require management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and when different estimates than management reasonably could have used have a material impact on the presentation of the company s financial condition  changes in financial condition or results of operations 
revenue recognition we derive our revenues from a variety of information technology services  including systems integration  packaged software integration and implementation services  programming  training and extended support services 
our services are contracted on either a time and materials basis or a fixed price basis 
for our time and materials contracts  we recognize revenues as work is performed  primarily based on hourly billing rates 
for our fixed price contracts  we recognize revenues using the percentage of completion method  which is based on the percentage of work performed in the period compared to the total estimated work to be performed over the entire contract 
revenues are subject to revision as the contract progresses to completion 
any revisions in the estimate are charged to operations in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
contracts are performed in phases 
losses on contracts  if any  are reserved in full when determined 
contract losses are determined by the amount by which the estimated cost of the contract exceeds the estimated total revenues that will be generated by the contract 
extended support revenues are recognized as services are rendered 
allowance for doubtful receivables an allowance for doubtful receivables is maintained for potential credit losses 
when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful receivables  management specifically analyzes accounts receivable on a client by client basis  including customer credit worthiness and current economic trends  and records any necessary bad debt expense based on the best estimate of the facts known to date 
should the facts regarding the collectability of receivables change  the resulting change in the allowance would be charged or credited to income in the period such determination is made 
such a change could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
accounting for income taxes we use an asset and liability approach to financial accounting and reporting for income taxes 
deferred income taxes are provided using currently enacted tax rates when tax laws and financial accounting standards differ with respect to the amount of income for a year and the basis of assets and liabilities 
significant management judgement is required in determining our provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against page 
table of contents our net deferred tax assets 
we have generated certain deferred tax assets as a result of operating losses and temporary differences between book and tax accounting  as well as tax benefits resulting from the exercise of employee stock options that were recorded as additional paid in capital in the period of exercise 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for income taxes  requires the establishment of a valuation allowance to reflect the likelihood of realization of deferred tax assets 
during the three months ended june   we recorded a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets of approximately million  as a result of operating losses incurred and reported in  and the second quarter of  as well as the then anticipated operating losses in the third quarter of  and the uncertainty of the timing and amount of future taxable income 
this valuation allowance represented approximately million in net deferred tax assets at march  plus an approximate million unrecorded tax benefit for the pre tax loss for the three months ended june  this allowance increased to million as of december  due to an approximate million unrecorded tax benefit for the pre tax loss for the six months ended december  if the realization of our deferred tax assets in future periods is considered more likely than not  an adjustment to our deferred tax asset would increase net income in the period such determination is made 
the amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable is based on significant estimates 
changes in these estimates could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations in future periods 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed in accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
compensation costs for employee stock options is measured as the excess  if any  of the quoted market price of the company s common stock at the date of grant over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock 
compared with revenues consolidated net revenues were million for  a decrease of percent from the same period in the prior year 
revenues before reimbursements decreased percent to million from million 
we believe that this decline in revenues was primarily due to decreased demand for our services and an increase in competitive pricing arising out of the continuing economic uncertainties  fundamental changes in the it services industry and a decline in corporate information technology capital expenditures as large and small companies reassessed their goals and budgets

table of contents costs and expenses project personnel costs were million in a decrease of percent from this decrease was largely attributable to staff reductions driven by our ongoing efforts to keep headcount and costs in line with the associated demand for our services  as described earlier in this item 
part of the headcount reductions resulted from an increase in annualized voluntary turnover to percent in from percent in project personnel costs as a percentage of revenues before reimbursements increased to percent for from percent for primarily due to a decline in average hourly billing rates and staff utilization 
average hourly billing rates decreased percent to the decline in average hourly billing rates reflects the increased competitive environment in the information technology consulting market as well as lower rates for post go live activities at certain accounts 
staff utilization declined to percent from percent 
other project expenses were million in  a decrease of percent from the decrease in other project expenses consisted of the following a decrease in business development costs of million  such as  travel  certain marketing costs and practice area development costs  a decrease in employee termination costs of million  a decrease in subcontractor costs of million due to the decline in revenues and the corresponding limited use of subcontractors  a decrease in other costs of million  primarily selling and sales related expenses  and a decrease in headcount related costs of million  which included training  computer and communication costs 
other project expenses as a percentage of revenues before reimbursements decreased to percent for from percent in primarily as a result of the aforementioned decrease in subcontractor costs and employee termination costs 
bad debt expense was million for compared to million for our bad debt expense for consisted of a million charge for a full valuation reserve of a long term receivable that is currently in litigation  offset by a million credit as a result of recoveries of previously reserved receivables as well as fewer collection issues in management and administrative support costs decreased by percent to million in from million in this decrease mainly resulted from a decrease in labor costs of million as we reduced headcount as a result of our cost management initiatives and our organizational changes announced in june as discussed in the following paragraph  and a decrease in office and occupancy related costs of million due to office closures and reduction in office space as part of our continued cost controls 
in addition  various other costs  such as travel and marketing  decreased million due to reduced headcount and our continued cost controls 
in the second quarter of  we recorded million in restructuring and other charges as a result of organizational changes announced in june these charges consisted of the severance costs of professional personnel and executives and office reductions as well as professional fees incurred in connection with terminated negotiations with a party that had expressed interest in acquiring us 
as of december   there was an accrual balance of million

the operating loss  excluding these charges  mainly resulted from the decline in revenues as well as higher project personnel costs as a percent of revenues due to lower billing rates and lower staff utilization 
other income other income for was million compared to million for the decrease is a result of lower interest rates year over year as well as the redemption of our marketable securities

project personnel costs as a percentage of revenues before reimbursements increased to percent for from percent for primarily due to a decline in average hourly billing rates 
average hourly billing rates decreased percent to the decline in hourly billing rates reflects the increased competitive environment in the information technology consulting market

this amount consisted of million from the non peer severance related costs recorded in as more fully described below and million related to certain lease terminations recorded in during  we recorded million in restructuring and other charges comprised of million relating to the closure of our peer software development operation and million in non peer severance related costs

operating income loss consolidated operating income was million for compared to a consolidated operating loss of million for our operating income for included restructuring and other credits of million 
our operating loss for included restructuring and other charges of million 
the improvement in operating income  excluding these restructuring and other credits charges  was mainly due to the reduction in bad debt expense

accounts receivable collections virtually offset our net loss adjusted for the non cash charges included in this net loss 
days sales outstanding declined by days to days at december  compared to december   as the percent decline in fourth quarter revenues was greater then the decline in receivables 
in addition  during we wrote off million of previously reserved accounts receivable which resulted in a decline in the allowance for doubtful receivables 
estimated future cash commitments include various office facilities  property and office equipment under operating leases and other costs that expire at various dates 
the minimum cash commitments under these non cancelable operating leases and other obligations with terms in excess of one year are as follows calendar year leases other total total represents cash commitments under non cancelable operating leases and other obligations with terms in excess of one year

page 
table of contents our primary sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents 
our cash and cash equivalents balance at december  was million 
depending on revenues and cash collections  we expect our cash and cash equivalent balance at march  to be approximately million to million 
while we will likely incur operating losses in  we believe that our cash and cash equivalents will continue to be sufficient to meet our cash requirements 
our investment policy is to maintain most of our cash and cash equivalents in highly liquid  large money market type funds 
this policy exposes us to short term interest rate fluctuations 
operating results and liquidity  including our ability to raise additional capital if necessary  may be materially and adversely affected by a decrease in demand for the company s services 
in addition  a number of other factors  including general economic conditions  technological changes  competition and other factors affecting the it industry generally  and the suspension or cancellation of a large project could have an adverse effect on future results and liquidity 
these aforementioned factors  as well as other factors  are discussed further in this section under assumptions underlying certain forward looking statements and factors that may affect future results 
we had a nonqualified deferred compensation plan at december  all company executives defined as vice presidential level and above were eligible to participate in this voluntary program  which permitted participants to defer receipt of a portion of their compensation 
deferred amounts were held in a rabbi trust for the benefit of plan participants and investment earnings or losses were credited to the participants accounts based on investment allocation options selected by the participants 
neither these investments nor the earnings thereon are guaranteed by the company 
these investments remain assets of the company and were available to the general creditors of the company in the event of our insolvency 
on february   the company announced that the compensation committee of its board of directors decided to terminate the company s nonqualified executive deferred compensation plan effective immediately 
because of dwindling participation  coupled with recent and proposed changes in tax and other legislation  the compensation committee decided the existence of the plan was no longer a significant factor in attracting and retaining key executive talent  accordingly  the plan will be terminated and all funds distributed to participants 
the company distributed these funds in late february we had a million unsecured line of credit facility the facility with bank of america national trust and savings association that expired on march  we had never borrowed against the facility and  accordingly  we chose not to renew it upon its expiration 
impact of inflation and backlog inflation should not have a significant impact on our operating results to the extent we are able to raise our hourly billing rates commensurate with our staff compensation rates 
however  if we are unable to raise our hourly billing rates  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
because the majority of our contracts may be terminated on relatively short notice  we do not consider backlog to be meaningful

assumptions underlying certain forward looking statements and factors that may affect future results this form k contains or may contain forward looking statements concerning our financial position  results of operations  cash flows  business strategy  budgets  projected costs and plans and objectives of management for future operations as well as other statements including words such as anticipate  believe  plan  estimate  expect  intend  and other similar expressions 
these forward looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties 
although we believe that the expectations reflected in these forward looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions  readers are cautioned that no assurance can be given that the expectations will prove correct and that actual results and developments may differ materially from those conveyed in the forward looking statements 
important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the expectations reflected in the forward looking statements include  among others  our ability to manage the pace of technological change  our ability to manage our current decreased revenue levels  our ability to attract new business and increase revenues and to attract and retain employees to service any new business  our ability to accommodate a changing business environment  general business and economic conditions in our operating regions  market conditions and competitive and other factors  our ability to continue to attract new clients and sell additional work to existing clients and our ability to manage costs and headcount relative to expected revenues  all as more fully described below 
forward looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made and we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward looking statement to reflect subsequent events or circumstances 
if we do update or correct one or more forward looking statements  investors and others should not conclude that we will make additional updates or corrections with respect thereto or with respect to other forward looking statements 
the cautionary statements provided page 
table of contents below are being made pursuant to the provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of the pslra and with the intention of obtaining the benefits of the safe harbor provisions of the pslra for any such forward looking information 
many of the factors discussed below  as well as other factors  have also been discussed in our prior filings 
factors which could cause our actual financial and other results to differ materially from any results that we might project  forecast  estimate or budget in the forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  the following rapid technological change the systems consulting and implementation market is characterized by rapid technological advances and developments  including the development and issuance of new software products and applications 
our failure to stay abreast of such advances and developments could materially adversely affect our business 
we utilize a number of different technologies in developing and providing it solutions for our customers 
the technologies we use are developing rapidly and are characterized by evolving industry standards in a wide variety of areas 
while we evaluate technologies on an ongoing basis and endeavor to utilize those that are most effective in developing it solutions for our customers  there can be no assurance that the technologies we utilize and the expertise we gain in those technologies will continue to be applicable in the future 
there can be no assurance that new technologies will be made available to us or that we will be able to economically apply them 
the inability to apply existing technologies and expertise to subsequent projects could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
management of change in demand our business has experienced significant volatility in the demand for our services and thus our revenues 
in fact  our quarterly revenues have declined for the last ten quarters since june  our ability to attract business from new clients through sales and marketing efforts  our specialty services that address targeted industry and business concerns  and our ability to successfully manage fluctuations in demand are key to our future success 
we continue to evaluate our business needs and the skill sets of our employees in order to balance our resources and costs 
any failure to effectively manage our costs and resources will adversely effect our business 
while we have taken steps to reduce our costs  we may be required to take further actions to reduce our costs if our revenues are insufficient to support our cost structure 
however  there is a point at which further cost cutting may be counter productive and we realize we cannot cost cut our way to profitability 
accordingly  any unexpected decline in demand without a corresponding and timely reduction in staffing and other expenses  or a staffing increase that is not accompanied by a corresponding increase in demand  could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
additionally  any future increase in demand without a corresponding increase in staffing may render us unable to maintain or improve our market share and or strain or overwhelm existing management resources  operational resources  financial resources and management information systems 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to manage future fluctuation in demand successfully 
page 
table of contents ability to attract and retain employees our business consists mainly of professional services and is inherently labor intensive 
our success depends in large part upon our ability to attract  retain and motivate highly skilled employees  particularly project managers and other senior personnel 
qualified project managers are often in high demand and are likely to remain a limited resource in the future 
several attributes of our work environment pose challenges to our ability to attract and retain employees  including i extensive travel requirements  ii our intense work environment and culture  iii our standards for employee technical skills and job performance  iv our practice of adjusting the number of technical personnel to reflect active project levels and v the decline in demand for the company s services 
although we expect to continue to attract sufficient numbers of highly skilled employees and to retain many of our existing project managers and other senior personnel for the foreseeable future  there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so 
failure to attract and retain key personnel could have a material adverse effect upon our business  operating results and financial condition and inhibit our ability to regain revenues 
dependence on key personnel the loss of some or all of our management personnel or project managers could have a material adverse impact on our business  including our ability to secure and complete engagements 
we have employment agreements with our senior management employees that contain non competition  non disclosure and non solicitation covenants 
our employment agreements generally do not have fixed expiration dates and may be terminated by either party 
most senior employees have employment agreements that are generally terminable by either party upon to days written notice 
entry into new lines of business we may enter into new lines of business 
our success in any such endeavor will depend upon  among other things  the ability of our management to identify suitable opportunities  successfully implement sound business strategies and avoid the legal and business risks of any new line of business in which we may operate 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to do any of the foregoing 
in addition  any such undertakings may result in additional costs without an immediate increase in revenues and any such undertaking may divert management s attention from the operation and growth of our core business 
growth by acquisition from time to time  we may consider acquiring other businesses 
the success of any such acquisition will depend upon  among other things  the ability of our management and employees to integrate acquired personnel  operations  products and technologies into our organization effectively  to retain and motivate key personnel of acquired businesses and to retain customers of acquired firms 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition opportunities  consummate acquisitions or successfully integrate acquired personnel and operations 
in addition  any acquisitions we undertake may involve certain other risks  including potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities and the diversion of our management s attention from other business concerns

table of contents cyclicality certain of our customers and potential customers are in industries that experience cyclical variations in profitability  which may in turn affect their willingness or ability to fund systems projects such as those for which we may be engaged 
litigation from time to time  we have been subject to litigation 
where we can make a reasonable estimate of the probable liability relating to pending litigation  we record a related liability 
as additional information becomes available  we assess the potential liability and revise estimates as appropriate 
however  because of uncertainties relating to litigation  the amount of our estimates could be wrong 
in addition to the potential cost and use of cash  pending or future litigation could divert management s attention and resources causing a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
quarterly results may fluctuate our results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of various factors such as general business conditions  timing of project ramp ups and ramp downs  differences in the number of billing days and or holidays between quarters  the number of vacation days and sick days taken by our employees in a particular quarter  and varying weather conditions 
these and other factors can reduce revenues in a given quarter with a corresponding adverse impact on our margins 
client concentration risks we derive a significant portion of our revenue from a limited number of clients 
during the quarter ended december   our top two clients and top five clients accounted for percent and percent of our revenues before reimbursements  respectively 
for  our top two clients accounted for percent of our revenues before reimbursements and our top five clients accounted for percent of our revenues before reimbursements 
in  our top two clients accounted for percent of our revenues before reimbursements and our top five clients accounted for percent of our revenues before reimbursements 
although our large clients may vary from time to time  our revenues and our results of operations and financial position could be adversely impacted if we were to lose one or more of these clients or if we were unable to collect a large receivable due from one of these clients 
most of our engagements are terminable on to days notice without penalty to the client 
an unanticipated termination of a major project could result in the loss of substantial anticipated revenues and could require us to maintain or terminate a significant number of underutilized employees  resulting in a higher number of unassigned people and or higher severance expenses 
project risks because of the project based nature of our work and the fact that many of the projects we undertake are large  there is a risk of a material adverse impact on operating results because of the unanticipated suspension or cancellation of a large project or a client s refusal or failure to pay fees and expenses when due 
a project cancellation or suspension or a refusal or failure to pay can be based on any number of causes  many of which are beyond our control 
these include financial difficulties of a client  a change in client priorities  client management or client strategies  and a change in client ownership 
the suspension or cancellation of a project or a failure or refusal to pay fees and expenses when due could result in a decrease or adjustment in revenues  the need to reassign staff and damage to our reputation 
page 
table of contents because many of our projects are high profile  mission critical projects for major clients  a failure or inability to meet a client s expectations for the amounts budgeted  timing and deliverables for the projects we undertake could damage our reputation and affect our ability to attract new business 
third party products and services are integral to the success of many of our projects 
to the extent that third parties do not deliver effective products and services on a timely basis  our project results could be negatively impacted 
although we attempt to limit this risk in our engagement arrangements with clients and maintain errors and omissions insurance  the failure of a project could expose us to significant incremental financial exposure 
competition the systems consulting and implementation market includes a large number of participants  is subject to rapid changes and is highly competitive 
we compete with and face potential competition from a number of companies that have significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources and greater name recognition than do we 
we also compete with globally sourced  lower cost service providers as well as smaller service providers with specific  more narrowly focused service offerings 
our clients primarily consist of fortune and other large corporations and there are an increasing number of professional services firms seeking systems consulting and implementation engagements from that client base 
we believe that our ability to compete depends in part on a number of factors outside our control  including the ability of our competitors to hire  retain and motivate project managers and staff  the long term relationships that our major competitors may have with potential clients  the ownership by our competitors of software used by potential clients  the development by others of software that is competitive with our products and services  and the price at which others offer comparable services 
in addition  our clients could develop or acquire in house expertise in services similar to those we provide  which would significantly reduce demand for our services 
no assurance can be given that we will be able to maintain our existing client base  maintain or increase the level of revenue generated by our existing clients or be able to attract new clients 
susceptibility to economic conditions our revenues and results of operations are subject to fluctuations based on the economic conditions in which we operate 
during periods of economic uncertainty or downturn  businesses typically reduce or eliminate their spending on discretionary items such as the services that we provide 
under such conditions  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
cost overruns our services are contracted on either a time and materials basis or a fixed price basis and many of our projects have budget constraints or estimates 
our failure to complete these projects within these parameters exposes us to unrecoverable cost overruns  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition

table of contents intellectual property rights many of our clients have required that we grant to them all proprietary and intellectual property rights with respect to the work product resulting from our performance of services  including the intellectual property rights to any custom software that we have developed for them 
each such grant of proprietary and intellectual property rights limits our ability to reuse work product components and work product solutions with other clients 
in some situations  we have obtained either an ownership interest or a license from our clients to permit us to market and sell the custom software we have developed for them 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will be able to obtain these rights in the future 
we also develop certain foundation and application software tools  methodologies and products that we own and license to our clients 
we regard these software tools  methodologies and products as proprietary and intend to protect our rights  where appropriate  with registered copyrights  patents  registered trademarks  trade secret laws and contractual restrictions on disclosure and transferring title 
however  there can be no assurance that any of these steps will be adequate to deter misappropriation of our proprietary rights or independent third party development of functionally equivalent products 
tsc and technology solutions company are registered service marks of the company 
in addition  our success is dependent upon our specialized expertise and methodologies 
to protect our proprietary information  we rely on a combination of trade secret and common law employee non disclosure policies and third party confidentiality agreements 
however  there can be no assurance that any of these steps will be adequate to deter misappropriation of our specialized expertise and methodologies 
although we believe that our services and products do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of others  there can be no assurance that others will not assert infringement claims against us in the future 
any such claim asserted against us may harm our reputation  cost us money  prevent us from offering some services or solutions  and divert our management s attention from the operation and growth of our business 
corporate governance provisions provisions of our charter and by laws may discourage  delay or prevent a merger or acquisition 
these provisions include the following the board of directors is staggered into three classes and the members may be removed only for cause upon the affirmative vote of holders of at least two thirds of the shares entitled to vote  the board of directors has the authority  without further action by the stockholders  to fix the rights and preferences and issue shares of preferred stock 
nasdaq national market listing requirements our common stock is listed on the nasdaq national market  which requires that listed stocks maintain a minimum per share closing bid price of the closing bid price of our stock has dropped below on occasions 
if our closing bid price were to drop below per share in the future for an extended period of time  we will face the possibility of delisting under nasdaq rules 
however  there are a variety of actions that we can take to prevent a delisting

table of contents risks of conducting international operations we have engaged in limited international operations 
because the cost of doing business abroad is typically higher for united states businesses than the cost of doing business domestically  we could experience a decline in our operating margins if the significance of our international operations increases 
international operations and the provision of services in foreign markets are subject to a number of special risks  including currency exchange rate fluctuations  trade barriers  exchange controls  national and regional labor strikes  political risks  additional security concerns and risks of increases in duties  taxes and governmental royalties  as well as changes in laws and policies governing operations of foreign based companies 
in addition  any success we experience internationally may depend upon our ability to attract  develop and retain a sufficient number of highly skilled  motivated local professional employees in each of those foreign countries where we conduct operations 
competition for such local personnel qualified to deliver our services can be intense  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to recruit  develop and retain a sufficient number of highly skilled  motivated local professional employees to compete successfully in the international market

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tsc is exposed to interest rate fluctuations 
changes in interest rates affect interest income on cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities held in trust 
our cash and cash equivalents were primarily invested in overnight money market type accounts 
average interest rates were approximately percent in compared to approximately percent in based on the cash and cash equivalents balances as of december  and  a hypothetical percent increase in interest rates would have resulted in approximately and million in additional net investment income during each of and  respectively 
as noted above  marketable securities held in trust were distributed to the participants in the company s nonqualified deferred compensation in late february as discussed in note of the consolidated financial statements  the financial statements of our non us subsidiaries are remeasured into non us dollars using the local currency as the functional currency 
the market risk associated with the foreign currency exchange rates is not material in relation to our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
we do not have any significant accounts payable  accounts receivable or commitments in a currency other than that of the reporting unit s functional currency 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments to manage the exposure in non us operations
