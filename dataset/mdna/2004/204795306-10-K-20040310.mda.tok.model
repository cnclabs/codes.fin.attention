corrlogic specializes in the development  implementation and support of complex  integrated inmate management software systems  including inmate medical management that improves the efficiency and accuracy of correctional facility operations 
corrlogic s focus is entirely on information solutions for the corrections industry 
during  compudyne expanded its offerings in the public safety and justice sector by completion of its acquisition of tiburon 
tiburon provides a fully integrated suite of products including computer assisted dispatch  records management  court and probation software systems for the law enforcement  fire and rescue  corrections and justice environments 
the company believes tiburon is a worldwide market leader in the development  implementation and support of public safety and justice automation systems 
in business since  with more than systems supporting approximately active customers  tiburon is a leader in public safety and justice solutions 
management outlook we find ourselves in a very challenging time 
we now have three major areas of emphasis the first is increasing the value of our backlog  the second is migrating to a business model with a more predictable revenue stream  and the third is finding attractive acquisition candidates to enhance our existing businesses 
during as depicted in the following chart  we saw the value of the company s backlog decline throughout the year 
institutional federal public security attack security safety and in thousands systems protection systems justice total december       march       june       september       december       historically  approximately over of the company s revenues are generated from sources where the ultimate customer is a state or local government unit 
during the last few years during the general economic slowdown  state and local budgets  which we are dependent on for our revenue sources  have come under intense pressure 
most states are currently running in a deficit situation  as are many local governments 
this has caused many of them to delay and in some cases temporarily cancel many infrastructure projects until such time as their economic fortunes rebound 
until such time as the economy as a whole improves and thus tax bases for our customers improve  we would anticipate our backlog levels continuing to remain under pressure 
to address this area of focus we are actively bidding on jobs and keeping our offerings in front of our customers so that when the current economic cycle turns around we will be well positioned to capitalize on new opportunities 
our second area of focus surrounds reengineering our business model so that it contains a greater degree of recurring revenue 
as indicated in the following table  approximately of our revenue is generated from recurring revenue sources primarily maintenance revenues  and the majority of these revenues occur in our public safety and justice segment 
the company defines one time revenue as revenue derived from discrete projects  from which the company does not expect to generate incremental revenue upon the completion of the project 
the company defines recurring revenue as sources of revenue from which the company anticipates receiving revenue in the current  as well as future periods  for example  annual renewable maintenance contracts 
one time revenue recurring revenue total institutional security systems    attack protection   federal security systems   public safety and justice    total    since the majority of our revenues are one time revenues and are non recurring  we must reinvent our book of business every day 
this makes it very difficult for us to project our future revenue stream and thus makes it very difficult for us to project our earnings as well as our business outlook 
over the next to months  we intend to modify our business model to rely less upon one time sources of revenue and more on recurring sources of revenue 
the third key focus area for the company is acquisitions 
with the january completion of our million  convertible subordinated note offering  we have significant resources with which to fund acquisitions 
we are particularly interested in three areas 
the first is businesses that would either prove additive or complementary to our current offerings in the public safety and justice segment 
we envision this segment as being a growth segment for our business 
we can only envision the demands of our nation s first responders growing in the foreseeable future 
furthermore  this business is characterized by strong recurring revenues which as discussed above is one of the key business drivers for compudyne 
second  we are continually looking for companies that have attractive security technology based products that we can leverage by offering the technology to our existing customers and markets 
the third type of business we are interested in acquiring is a high end commercial security integrator 
our primary clientele are currently governmental units 
throughout our other three segments  over the years we have developed significant skills as it relates to security integration and applications 
our offerings however are sold almost exclusively to various governmental units 
we believe that the purchase of the right high end commercial security integrator would afford us the market entree whereby we would be able to offer many of our existing offerings into a wholly new business arena  and one that we believe is not served as well as the governmental arena to which we have heretofore dedicated ourselves 
we believe that our ability to address and implement the above three areas of focus will significantly enhance our future growth opportunities and will provide for more predictable financial results 
results of operations years ended december  and revenues 
the company had revenues of million and million for years ended december  and  respectively 
this was an increase of million or 
revenues from the institutional security systems segment increased from million in to million in this was an increase of 
the institutional security systems segment is largely a construction driven business 
much of its revenue is obtained by working on new and retrofit construction projects in the corrections industry  as opposed to sources of recurring revenue 
as such  the increase in revenue experienced by this segment is largely attributable to its ability to work on more projects than it did in the previous year 
one of the reasons it was able to do this was because its backlog had grown from million at december  to million at december  thus providing it with the ability to engage in more work in than it did in at december   the backlog for the institutional security system s segment declined to million 
the year was a slow bidding period for the company 
although the gross amount of construction spending in the corrections area remained relatively flat between and  the types of projects that the company solicits  namely large scale medium to maximum security installations  declined in this situation was further compounded by the general state and local governmental budget deficits which are causing these governmental units to rethink and delay many of their pending corrections projects 
revenues from the attack protection segment stayed stable at million during both and the attack protection segment was largely capacity constrained during as a result  the company purchased an existing  square foot factory on acres of land in close proximity to its existing factory in montgomery  alabama 
this expansion provided the segment with the necessary capacity to generate incremental revenue of approximately million per year 
this capacity increase was largely driven by the company s expectation that the demands for its products  principally its bullet and blast resistant windows and doors would accelerate significantly in the post september  world 
throughout and this anticipated increase in demand did not materialize leaving the segment with significant excess capacity 
this segment is composed of two chief product offerings  namely norshield  which encompasses the bullet and blast resistant windows and doors and ancillary products  and fiber sensys  which encompasses its fiber optic intrusion detection systems 
during the norshield line experienced a decline in revenues  whereas the fiber sensys line experienced a increase in revenue 
the company continues to see heightened interest for its fiber sensys products and expects sales for these items to continue to experience sustainable growth 
the slow down in the government building process experienced during and early has appeared to stabilize 
now it appears that projects are being released for construction  and thus the attack protection segment is experiencing increased bidding activity for its products 
during the fourth quarter of the company furnished bids to supply its products for eight new embassy projects 
this was the largest amount of embassy projects bid in a single calendar year for 
in addition  all indications are that this increased level of new embassy construction will continue for at least the next few years 
revenues from the federal security systems segment increased from million in to million in this was an increase of 
substantially all of this segment s revenue is backlog driven 
its backlog is therefore a precursor to future revenues 
the federal security systems segment s failure to have any meaningful backlog at december  resulted in substantially all of its revenue being driven by contract awards it received during this inherently caused the segment s revenue to be low during that period 
the federal security systems segment ended with a significantly improved backlog level of million 
as such it entered with a much greater book of business from which to generate its increased revenue during backlog at december  was million 
revenues from the public safety and justice segment increased million from million during to million in on may  the company completed its acquisition of tiburon  inc prior thereto  the company controlled approximately of tiburon and recorded its investment in tiburon under the equity method of accounting 
subsequent to may   tiburon became a wholly owned subsidiary of the company at which time its operating results were consolidated with those of the company 
tiburon s revenues for amounted to million as compared to million for the eight month period tiburon was owned by compudyne in expenses 
cost of goods sold increased from million during to million in this increase was largely a result of the acquisition of tiburon on may   which added million of cost of goods sold to the results of the company  as well as increased costs of goods sold of million at the institutional security systems segment  all largely attributable to the increased sales levels attained by these segments 
the smaller percentage increase in cost of goods sold as compared to the percentage increase in sales resulted in an increased gross profit percentage of in as compared to in cost of goods sold in the institutional security systems segment increased from million in to million in this was an increase of million or 
this increase was less than the related sales increase of this segment of resulting in an increase in the gross profit percentage from in to in during  the west coast operations of the institutional security systems segment experienced significant cost overruns on many of its projects 
these cost overruns were incurred and recorded during the third and fourth quarters of and amounted to approximately million 
as a result  as these projects were brought to completion in  the revenues generated by them resulted in little margin or in some cases losses 
the company recorded approximately million of additional write downs on west coast projects that were either completed or neared completion in these were the primary reasons for the depressed gross profit percentage by institutional security systems 
to address this situation  in the company implemented more centralized controls and replaced certain personnel at its west coast operations 
cost of goods sold in the attack protection segment decreased from million in to million in this was a decrease of million or 
this decrease was smaller than the related sales increase of this segment of  resulting in an increase in the gross profit percentage from in to in although the results of this segment improved in  they are still significantly below what is expected of this segment 
we are actively working to better utilize the new capacity provided by the company in one of the actions we have taken was to relocate the airteq manufacturing operation in oregon and consolidate it into the facilities we have in montgomery  alabama 
this was done in an effort to enhance the utilization of our owned facilities in alabama and thus use up some of our excess manufacturing capacity 
although not a huge contributor  this did in fact result in further utilization of approximately  square feet of previously unused manufacturing space in our new plant in alabama 
cost of goods sold in the federal security systems segment increased from million in to million in this was an increase of million or 
this increase was slightly less than the related sales increase of this segment of 
the federal security systems segment gross profit percentage was and in and respectively 
substantially all of the projects awarded in this segment are discrete projects 
cost of goods sold in the public safety and justice segment increased from million in to million in this was an increase of million 
substantially all of this increase was a result of the company s may  acquisition of tiburon 
in addition  in the company recognized approximately million of revenue related to hardware supplied pursuant for a contract with one of its customers 
this hardware was furnished at minimal gross profit of approximately  which caused the entire margin for this segment to be reduced 
this segment recorded a million charge for a contract in litigation 
this charge was recorded by reducing previously recorded revenues by approximately thousand and increasing cost of goods sold by million 
while the outcome cannot be predicted  the company believes it is in a strong position and intends to vigorously pursue this action and recover its contract value plus any additional damages incurred by the company 
operating expenses increased from million in to million in this was an increase of million 
much of the change in operating expenses was a result of the company s may  acquisition of tiburon 
included in operating expenses in is thousand related to the closure and relocation of its iss midwest regional office and its airteq manufacturing group 
in conjunction with the acquisition on may   of tiburon  inc and in compliance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas business combinations  the company determined the fair value of the following identifiable assets and assigned the indicated lives thereto for purposes of amortization and depreciation 
amount life in thousands in years trade name  indefinite customer relationships  software  backlog other the amortization of the above intangibles resulted in the company recording amortization expense related to these intangibles of thousand and thousand in and  respectively  which is included in operating expenses 
research and development expenses increased from million in to million in being a technology driven enterprise  the company s public safety and justice segment is required to continually update and enhance its software offerings thus causing it to incur significant research and development costs 
the increase in over is largely a reflection of the may acquisition of tiburon by the company 
interest expense remained relatively constant at million in both and monthly weighted monthly weighted average average amount rate amount rate in thousands in thousands bank borrowings   industrial revenue bonds  subordinated borrowings  in addition the company recorded the following interest expense amortization and write off of financing charges taxes on income 
the effective tax rate in was as compared to in the primary reason for this change in effective tax rates is due to a change in the mix in the states in which the company s earnings occurred 
net income 
the company reported net income of million and million in and  respectively 
diluted earnings per share increased to 
in from 
in the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and equivalents increased from million in to million years ended december  and revenues 
the company had revenues of million and million for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
this was an increase of million or 
revenues from the institutional security systems segment increased from million in to million in this was an increase of 
the institutional security systems segment is largely a construction driven business 
much of its revenue is obtained by working on new and retrofit construction projects in the corrections industry as opposed to  from sources of recurring revenue 
as such  the increase in revenue experienced by this segment is largely attributable to its ability to win and work on more projects than it did in the previous year 
one of the reasons it was able to do this was because its backlog had grown from million at december  to million at december  thus providing it with the ability to engage in more work in than it did in at december   the backlog for the institutional security system s segment had grown still further to million 
revenues from the attack protection segment increased from million in to million in  an increase of the attack protection segment was largely capacity constrained in as a result  the company purchased an existing  square foot factory on acres of land in close proximity to its existing factory in montgomery  alabama 
this expansion provides the segment the necessary capacity to generate incremental revenue of approximately million per year 
of the million of increased revenue generated by the attack protection segment  million was generated as a result of this expansion 
attack protection also encompasses the company s fiber sensys product line 
this product line continued to experience increased demand for its perimeter protection product resulting in sales of million in as compared to million in as such  of the revenue growth in the attack protection segment in resulted from the growth of the fiber sensys product 
revenues from the federal security systems segment decreased from million in to million in this was a decrease of 
at december  the federal security system segment backlog was a relatively small thousand 
substantially all of the company s revenue is backlog driven 
its backlog is therefore a precursor to future revenues 
the federal security segment s failure to have any meaningful backlog at december  resulted in substantially all of its revenue to be driven by contract awards it received in this will inherently cause its revenue to decline 
the federal security segment did conclude with million of backlog 
revenues from the public safety and justice segment increased million from million in to million in  on may   the company completed its acquisition of tiburon  inc prior thereto  the company controlled approximately of tiburon and recorded its investment in tiburon under the equity method of accounting 
subsequent to may   tiburon became a wholly owned subsidiary of the company and thus its results are now consolidated with those of the company 
tiburon s revenues for the eight month period it was owned by the company were million  which accounts for substantially all of this segment s revenue increase 
expenses 
cost of goods sold increased from million in to million in this was an increase of million or 
this increase was largely a result of the acquisition of tiburon on may   which added an additional million of cost of goods sold to the results of the company 
the balance of the increase in cost of goods results from increases from the institutional security systems and attack protection segments  offset by a decline from the federal security systems segment 
the smaller percentage increase in cost of goods sold as compared to the percentage increase in sales resulted in an increased gross profit percentage of in as compared to in gross profit increased from million in to million in cost of goods sold in the institutional security systems segment increased from million in to million in this was an increase of million or  this increase was larger than the related sales increase of this segment of resulting in a decline in the gross profit percentage from in to in during  the west coast operations of the institutional security systems segment experienced significant cost overruns on many of its projects 
these cost overruns amounted to approximately million  which accounts for the majority of the decline in the segment s gross profit percentage in cost overruns amounted to approximately million and million in the third and fourth quarters of  respectively 
to address this situation  the company implemented more centralized controls and has replaced certain personnel at its west coast operations 
cost of goods sold in the attack protection segment increased from million in to million in this was an increase of million or 
this increase was larger than the related sales increase of this segment of  resulting in a decline in the gross profit percentage from in to in the attack protection segment experienced lower than expected volume in its bullet and blast resistant windows and doors product line which was exacerbated by excess plant capacity which resulted from the addition of its new  square foot factory which was placed in service during the first quarter of as a result of the terrorist attacks of september   the company geared up in anticipation of increased demand for this segment s product  which is only now beginning to materialize 
this new factory was provisioned and staffed  via new equipment and hires as well as by the movement of equipment and staff from its existing factory 
this resulted in the company running both of its factories at levels significantly below optimum capacity  resulting in numerous operational inefficiencies 
as a result  the company experienced incremental expenses in excess of the commensurate volume increase thus resulting in its decline in gross profit percentage 
cost of goods sold in the federal security systems segment decreased from million in to million in this was a decrease of million or 
this decrease was larger than the related sales decrease of this segment of  resulting in an increase in the gross profit percentage from in to in substantially all of the projects awarded to this segment are discrete projects 
the increased gross profit percentage is a result of the projects awarded in having a greater margin than those awarded in the prior year 
cost of goods sold in the public safety and justice segment increased from million in to million in this was an increase of million 
substantially all of this increase was a result of the company s may  acquisition of tiburon 
operating expenses increased from million in to million in this was an increase of million or 
substantially all of the change in operating expenses was a result of the company s may  acquisition of tiburon 
amortization of intangible assets and capitalized software acquired in the tiburon acquisition 
in conjunction with the acquisition on may   of tiburon  inc and in compliance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 sfas business combinations  the company determined the fair value of the following identifiable assets and assigned the indicated lives thereto for purposes of amortization 
amount life in thousands in years trade name  indefinite customer relationships  software  backlog other the amortization of the above intangibles for the eight months the company owned tiburon in resulted in the company recording amortization expense related to the intangibles of thousand included in operating expenses 
research and development expenses increased from thousand in to million in historically  the company did not expend significant monies on research and development 
in  with the acquisition of tiburon  the company expended significantly more dollars on software development 
it should be noted that these research and development expenditures are presently expected to be recurring expenses and the approximate million incurred by tiburon in was only for the eight month period tiburon was owned by compudyne in the amount expended by tiburon during calendar  including the period it was not owned by the company was significantly greater 
tiburon provides a fully integrated suite of products including computer assisted dispatch  records management  court and probation software systems for the law enforcement  fire and rescue  corrections and justice markets 
tiburon is a worldwide market leader in the development  implementation  and support of public safety and justice automation systems 
being a technology driven enterprise  tiburon is required to continually update and enhance its software offerings thus causing it to incur significant research and development costs 
interest expense decreased from million in to million in the decrease in the company s interest expense in is a result of the company repaying a high interest rate subordinate borrowing million at in october with the proceeds from its private investment  public equity pipe financing 
in addition  interest expense included thousand of expense related to the write off of non recurring capitalized finance charges from a previous bank financing that was replaced in november in addition  to finance the acquisition of tiburon  inc the company s banks increased its line of credit by million  which the company borrowed in full to pay part of the cash portion of the purchase price included in operating expenses 
the following table compares the weighted average of the company s and interest bearing borrowings and the related interest rates charged thereon 
monthly weighted monthly weighted average average amount rate amount rate in thousands in thousands bank borrowings   industrial revenue bonds   subordinated borrowings   in addition the company recorded the following interest expense amortization and write off of financing charges other income in primarily relates to dividends of thousand received on the investment in the preferred shares of tiburon and equity income of thousand recorded on the investment in tiburon prior to may  taxes on income 
the effective tax rate in was as compared to in in a reduction of a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset on the company s balance sheet was recorded because it was determined that as a result of the company s continued higher level of taxable earnings  it is more likely than not that the company would realize the tax benefit 
for the benefit was thousand 
absent this valuation reduction  the effective tax rate would have been in the primary reason for this change in effective tax rates is due to a change in the mix in the states in which the company s earnings occur and because of lower levels of tax deductions received from same day sales from employees exercising and selling stock purchased under the company s stock option plan 
net income 
the company reported net income of million and million in and  respectively 
fully diluted earnings per share decreased to 
in from 
in the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and equivalents increased from million in to million in during the year  approximately thousand shares of common stock were repurchased by the company 
this decline in the shares outstanding was offset by the new shares issued in the tiburon purchase transaction in late may liquidity and capital resources the company funds its operations through cash flows generated from its operations  bank and public financings  and the sale of its common stock 
the company s liquidity requirements arise from cash necessary to carry its inventories and billed and unbilled receivables  for capital expenditures  to repurchase shares of its common stock under its share repurchase program  for payments of principal and interest on outstanding indebtedness and for acquisitions 
the ultimate customers of the company are primarily federal  state and local governmental units 
in the event the funding of these governmental units is reduced for any reason  including budgetary reductions due to economic conditions  there is a risk that the demand for the company s goods and services would decrease which would reduce the availability of funds to the company 
as of december   the company had working capital of million compared with million as of december  the most significant changes in working capital were decreases in accounts receivable and costs in excess of billings 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in versus million provided by operating activities in net cash used for investing activities was million in compared to million in capital expenditures declined from million in to million in much of the capital expenditures related to the acquisition and provisioning of the attack protection segment s new  square foot factory  completed in the second quarter of in montgomery  alabama to increase capacity of the attack protection segment 
net payments for the acquisition of tiburon  inc during were million 
net cash used in financing activities amounted to million in compared with million provided by financing activities in as a result of the cash generated by the company s operations in  the company was able to reduce its bank borrowings by million 
approximately million of the million borrowing from banks in were used to finance the acquisition of tiburon on may  the decrease in cash used in financing activities in is primarily a result of repayments under the company s bank credit facilities 
the following table summarizes the contractual obligations of the company as of december  and the payments due by period 
in thousands long term debt operating leases december thereafter  totals   in addition  the company enters into purchase obligations to procure equipment and services  including subcontractor contracts  in the performance of the day to day operations of its business 
substantially all of these obligations are covered by our existing backlog and the revenues generated by these backlogs are expected to be sufficient to meet any payment obligations resulting from these purchase commitments 
on january   the company completed an offering of million principal amount of convertible subordinated notes due january  the offering was for million principal amount plus an underwriter s over allotment option of million principal amount  which was exercised in full 
the notes bear interest at the rate of per annum  payable semi annually  and are convertible into shares of common stock at a conversion price of per share 
the company s total outstanding borrowings at december  amounted to approximately million 
these borrowings were at variable rates 
the company had two borrowings from banks  both made under a credit agreement that provides for both term borrowings and a line of credit 
the first borrowing is a three year term loan due in quarterly installments through november this borrowing  originally in the amount of million  was entered into on november  the amount outstanding as of december  was million 
the interest rate is variable and can range from libor to or prime to 
the rate charged the company is based on the company s leverage ratio at the end of each quarter 
the leverage ratio is defined as the ratio of consolidated indebtedness for borrowed money  capital leases  guaranties of borrowed money and reimbursement obligations in respect of letters of credit divided by the company s earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization ebitda 
the interest rate charged to the company was at december  the second borrowing available from banks under the credit agreement is a million line of credit  due february  borrowings outstanding under this line of credit as of december  were million 
its interest rate is variable and can range from libor plus to or the prime rate plus to 
the interest rate charged the company is based on the company s leverage ratio at the end of each quarter as defined above 
the rates charged to the company ranged from to at december  the company also had two industrial revenue bonds outstanding at december  in the amounts of million and million 
the interest rate charged to the company at december  was and respectively 
these borrowings bore interest at variable rates between and during based on weekly market conditions 
these bonds are fully collateralized by bank letters of credit issued under the credit agreement 
the company s banks consider letters of credit as outstanding borrowings when considering the amount of availability the company has remaining under its line of credit 
other than the company s million of letters of credit  the company has no other material off balance sheet liabilities 
the company had million of unused availability under its line of credit at december  as a result of the variable nature of the interest rate on the company s bank borrowings  any increase in the amount of outstanding borrowings and or decreases in the company s ebitda an increase in the leverage ratio will result in the company s interest rate increasing and thus the amount of interest expense incurred also increasing 
on january   the company completed an offering of million principal amount of convertible subordinated notes due january  the offering was for million principal amount plus an underwriter s over allotment option of million principal amount  which was exercised in full 
the notes bear interest at the rate of per annum  payable semi annually  and are convertible into shares of common stock at a conversion price of per share 
the company anticipates that cash generated from operations and borrowings under the working capital line of credit and its convertible subordinated note will enable the company to meet its liquidity  working capital and capital expenditure requirements during the next months 
the company s notes payable to banks mature on february  the company  however  may require additional financing to pursue its strategy of growth through acquisitions to meet its long term liquidity  working capital and capital expenditure requirements 
if such financing is required  there are no assurances that it will be available  or if available  that it can be obtained on terms favorable to the company 
the company presently has no binding commitment or binding agreement with respect to any acquisition or strategic investment 
however  from time to time  the company may be party to one or more non binding letters of intent regarding material acquisitions  which  if consummated  may be paid for with cash or through the issuance of a significant number of shares of the company s common stock 
on may   the company completed the purchase of tiburon  inc compudyne distributed approximately million shares of compudyne common stock and approximately  warrants to purchase shares of the company s stock  valued collectively at million and approximately million  net in cash to acquire the portion of tiburon that the company did not previously own 
including the company s initial investment of million in tiburon and transaction costs resulted in the company recording million as the value of the consideration paid for this acquisition 
to fund the cash portion of the tiburon acquisition  the company negotiated an increase in its bank line of credit of million effective may  borrowings made by the company under this increased facility may result in increased interest rates charged to the company  to the extent its leverage ratio changes resulting in increased interest charges 
as a result of the approval of this borrowing  the company had adequate cash available to complete this transaction 
the current interest rate environment nationally is at historic lows 
in light of this favorable environment  the company determined that it was in its best interests to lock in a favorable fixed interest rate for a significant amount of borrowings 
these borrowings  which were made on a subordinated basis were used to pay off the company s existing bank debt and will be available to fund the company s future growth opportunities and also will be available to fund any acquisitions which the company may wish to pursue 
these funds will be instrumental in the company s growth through acquisition strategy 
unlike the company s existing bank debt  the convertible subordinated notes do not contain any restrictive covenants or ratios 
as a result of securing this borrowing  the company intends to renegotiate its current bank lines of credit 
although the company currently does not see the need to borrow under its bank lines  it intends to keep such lines open and available to enhance its financial flexibility 
during january and february  the company repaid substantially all of its outstanding bank borrowings from the proceeds of the issuance of its convertible subordinated note 
the company has decided not to repay any of its industrial revenue bond irb borrowings as it has determined that there were certain favorable tax treatments afforded the company when it entered into these irb s which it would lose in the event these borrowings were repaid prematurely 
additional considerations cost containment due to current economic conditions  and in light of a very strong competitive environment  the company recognizes that its ability to increase the prices it charges its customers is limited 
as a result  in order to enhance its profitability  the company recognizes the need to continue to seek ways to reduce its costs 
office closures and consolidations in january  the company closed its midwest regional office  located in wauwatusa  wisconsin  and consolidated its operations into its montgomery  alabama office 
the company does not believe this office closure will have a negative impact on its ability to generate sales in the midwest region

in conjunction with the airteq move  the company s fiber sensys business  which manufactures fiber optic based perimeter sensors for intrusion detection  moved from its leased space in beaverton  oregon to the larger airteq facility  which resulted in a  square foot expansion for fiber sensys

critical accounting policies a complete description of the company s significant accounting policies appears in the notes to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report 
percentage of completion accounting and revenue recognition approximately of the company s revenues are derived from long term contracts where revenue is recognized under the percentage of completion method of accounting 
the company s software related contracts utilize labor hours incurred to date on a project  divided by the total expected project hours to determine the completion percentage 
the company s manufacturing and construction contracts utilize costs incurred to date on a project  divided by the total expected project costs to determine the completion percentage 
both of these methods require considerable judgment and as such  the estimates derived at any point in time could differ significantly from actual results 
these estimates effect many of the balance sheet and statement of operations accounts including net sales  cost of goods sold  accounts receivable  contract costs in excess of billings and billings in excess of contract costs incurred 
revenues for support and maintenance contracts are deferred and recognized ratably over the life of the contract 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are recognized in the period such losses are determined 
goodwill and intangible assets the company reviews the carrying value of goodwill and unamortized intangible assets annually during the fourth quarter of the year as of october or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable  utilizing a discounted cash flow model 
changes in estimates of future cash flows caused by items such as unforeseen events or changes in market conditions could negatively affect the reporting unit s fair value and result in an impairment charge 
the company cannot predict the occurrence of events that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill and intangible assets that totaled approximately million  net at december  stock compensation policy the company accounts for its stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method and in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles of apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
no stock based employee compensation employee compensation cost is reflected in net income  as all options granted had an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the underlying common stock on the date of the grant 
economic conditions and the after effect of the september  terrorist attacks much of the work compudyne performs is for state and local governmental units 
these entities have been particularly hard hit by recent economic conditions and the resultant contraction of the tax bases of these governmental units 
this has caused these governmental units to carefully evaluate their budgets and defer expenses and projects where possible 
much of the work of the company s public safety and justice and institutional security systems segments is contracted with these state and local governmental units 
as a result  these segments have seen delays in new work available to be bid and worked on 
in addition  even work that has been contracted for where possible is being deferred by the customer into the future  presumably when the economy will experience more robust times 
after the occurrence of the tragic events of the september  terrorist attacks  there was a general perception that compudyne s federal security systems and attack protection segments would see a significant increase in order flow 
to the contrary  in the months subsequent to the terrorist attacks these segments saw a slowing in new work opportunities as the various federal agencies and other customers that are the usual source of business for the company slowed their procurement processes waiting for definitive direction as to how to proceed in the post september world 
now further complicated by the military action in iraq  the company s customers are reevaluating priorities and budgets and are funding only their most pressing demands while also making key decisions as to which projects can be deferred 
over time the company believes these units will start to see a significant increase in business which has not as of yet begun 
as a result of the above factors  during the last two years the company has experienced a more challenging marketplace than it experienced in several years prior to september  impact of inflation inflation did not have a significant effect on compudyne s operations during market risk the company is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
at december   the company had a total of million of notes payable outstanding 
these borrowings were all at variable rates 
the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement on june  in the initial amount of million 
the amount of this swap agreement declines by thousand on a quarterly basis until it becomes on october  at december  the amount of the swap agreement had declined to million at a fixed rate of 
as such  approximately million of the company s variable rate borrowings were not hedged with an interest rate swap agreement 
on january   the company completed an offering of million principal amount of convertible subordinated notes due january  the offering was for million principal amount plus an underwriter s over allotment option of million principal amount  which was exercised in full 
the notes bear interest at the rate of per annum  payable semi annually  and are convertible into shares of common stock at a conversion price of per share 
the company used a portion of the proceeds of this note offering to pay down its variable bank notes payable 
subsequent to the pay down of its bank notes payable the only variable rate borrowings outstanding are approximately million of industrial revenue bonds  which approximates the amount of its outstanding swap agreement 
in the event interest rates increase dramatically  since these lines bear interest at variable rates  the increase in interest rate expense to the company could be material to the results of operations of the company
