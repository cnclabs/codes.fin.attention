the company s products under development directed to cardiovascular disease consist of controlled release  once a day  oral dosage formulations  and the company s respiratory products under development consist of aerosolized inhalation formulations to be used primarily with kos proprietary inhalation devices 
the company s current business strategy is based upon developing drugs that are reformulations of existing approved prescription pharmaceutical products  but which offer certain safety advantages or patient compliance advantages compared with existing formulations of such products 
the principal elements of kos current business strategy are as follows i develop or acquire products with unrealized commercial potential where safety or patient compliance may be improved  ii focus on the large  rapidly growing cardiovascular and respiratory markets  which include many chronic diseases requiring long term therapy  iii develop proprietary formulations of currently approved pharmaceutical compounds  iv manage internally the clinical development of its products  v manufacture its products internally  or where necessary or prudent  using a contract manufacturer  vi market its products directly through the company s specialty sales force  which kos may supplement with a contract sales organization or other partners  and vii leverage its core competencies through corporate and academic alliances

net sales of the company s niaspan and 
table of contents advicor products increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the same period in this increase in revenue was primarily attributable to increases in unit volume and prices for the company s products during the period  and to a change in product return estimates as described below in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
net income for the year ended december  increased to million from a net loss of million for the same period in this dramatic turnaround in net income generation was primarily attributable to the revenue growth experienced by the company s niaspan and advicor products  including  as previously mentioned  the effect of a change in accounting estimate 
because kos current business strategy is mostly dependent on the reformulation of existing compounds  the company s business could be subject to significant competitive pressures 
as such  kos critical success factors include its ability to continue to increase the amount of revenue generated by the niaspan and advicor products and its ability to successfully develop and or acquire new products or drugs

table of contents results of operations critical accounting policies the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to consolidated financial statements 
the company believes that its most critical accounting policies include revenue recognition and the estimation of allowances principally related to product returns  managed care rebates  chargebacks  reimbursements relating to medicaid and medicare  and accounting for income taxes 
the allowances are based upon consideration of a variety of factors  including but not limited to actual return experience by product type  the market for the product  estimated customer inventory levels by product  and other current and projected economic conditions 
actual product returns  managed care rebates  chargebacks  reimbursements relating to medicaid and medicare  other allowances incurred  and management s expectations regarding the continuing need for a valuation allowance on deferred income tax assets are dependent upon future events 
the company s management periodically reviews these policies and estimates  the effect of which is reflected as a component of net income in the period in which the change is known 
other than the change described below associated with the company s estimate of its product return exposure  such changes to these estimates have not been material to the company s results of operations during the years ended december   and the company periodically evaluates the volume of its niaspan and advicor products that are in customer inventories or elsewhere in the distribution channel to determine whether increased risk of product returns exists 
for the period from the introduction of its products through december   kos return risk expectations were consistently based on its limited product return experience given the early stage nature of its products and of the company 
accordingly  kos established a specific return risk estimate based on estimated inventory levels in the distribution channel that was used to determine the amount of revenue that could be recorded during a given period 
during the year ended december   as a result of the significant history of minimal returns for both products since their introduction  kos revised its return risk estimates to reflect the historically low product return patterns 
this change in accounting estimate resulted in the company recognizing as revenue all product shipments made during the year ended december   as well as million of its prior period product shipments not recognized as revenue because of its previous product return risk exposure estimates 
the impact of this change in estimate increased the company s reported revenues  net income  and basic and diluted earnings per share by million  million  and per share and per share  respectively  for the year ended december  the company will continue to monitor wholesaler inventory levels  and  if the company s product return risk exceeds acceptable levels  the company may be required to not recognize the revenue and related costs associated with the excess inventory until such return risk is mitigated

table of contents allowance against deferred tax assets and  based on the history of net losses  concluded that there is not sufficient evidence as of december  to determine that the company will more likely than not realize all or a portion of its deferred tax assets

market acceptance and sales growth of niaspan and advicor the company s success depends primarily upon its ability to successfully market and sell increasing quantities of the niaspan and advicor products 
the company s ability to successfully sell increasing quantities of the niaspan and advicor products will depend significantly on the continued acceptance of the niaspan product by physicians and their patients despite the introduction of advicor 
as a consequence of the on going commercialization of the advicor product  which is a combination product including niaspan and a statin  prescription levels for niaspan may be adversely affected to the extent a significant number of physicians prescribe advicor as a substitute product for their patients who are 
table of contents currently taking niaspan 
such substitution could have an adverse effect on the growth of the combined revenue generated from the sale of the company s products 
the company believes that intolerable flushing and potential liver toxicity associated with other currently available formulations of niacin are the principal reasons why physicians generally have been reluctant to prescribe or recommend such formulations 
flushing episodes are often characterized by facial redness  tingling or rash  and are a side effect that often occurs when humans ingest niacin 
currently available formulations of niacin generally either require  in the case of immediate release niacin  the patient to take niacin several times per day  resulting in multiple flushing episodes  or result  in the case of sustained release niacin  in liver toxicity 
although most patients taking the niaspan and advicor products will sometimes flush  the formulation and dosing regimen for niaspan and advicor have been designed to maximize patient acceptance and minimize the occurrence of flushing and liver toxicity 
if  however  a significant number of patients using the niaspan and advicor products were to suffer episodes of flushing that they consider intolerable or to suffer other side effects  physicians may discontinue prescribing the niaspan and advicor products or patients may stop taking niaspan and advicor  which would have a material adverse effect on the company 
unanticipated side effects or unfavorable publicity concerning the niaspan or advicor products or any other product incorporating technology similar to that used in the niaspan or advicor products also could have an adverse effect on the company s ability to obtain regulatory approvals or to achieve acceptance by prescribing physicians  managed care providers  or patients  any of which would have a material adverse effect on the company 
on january   the company began commercializing the advicor product 
the company s ability to successfully sell increasing quantities of the advicor product will depend significantly on the increasing acceptance of the advicor product by physicians and their patients 
if a significant number of patients using the advicor product were to suffer episodes of flushing that they consider intolerable or to suffer more serious side effects  such as rhabdomyolysis or myopathy  physicians may discontinue prescribing the advicor product or patients may stop taking advicor  which would have a material adverse effect on the company 
rhabdomyolysis is a rare disease in which serious muscle damage results in release of muscle cell contents into the bloodstream  which may be fatal 
myopathy is a disorder of muscle tissue or muscles that can result from endocrine disorders  metabolic disorders  infection or inflammation of the muscles  and from certain drugs 
there have been several cases where niaspan one of the principal ingredients in advicor or advicor have been identified as possible causes of myopathy 
unanticipated side effects or unfavorable publicity concerning the advicor product or any other product incorporating technology similar to that used in the advicor product also could have an adverse effect on the company s ability to maintain regulatory approvals or to achieve acceptance by prescribing physicians  managed care providers  or patients  any of which would have a material adverse effect on the company 
in addition  advicor may prove to be difficult to successfully sell because the cholesterol market is dominated by competitors with significantly larger sales forces and with significantly greater marketing resources than those available to the company 
further  advicor is a combination of two well known cholesterol drugs  niacin and lovastatin  that have been available for a significant period of time 
although the combination of these drugs is highly effective in improving all of the major components of cholesterol  it is possible that physicians may not prescribe advicor because it is not as new as more recently introduced compounds  such as the potent statin products marketed by the company s competitors 
also  because advicor is a combination of two currently available drugs  advicor has been approved by the fda for the improvement of cholesterol disorders in patients who were not able to achieve desired cholesterol improvements by taking either niaspan or lovastatin alone 
consequently  although such an approved treatment indication is standard for combination drugs such as advicor  it is possible that physicians will not prescribe advicor until they have first prescribed either niaspan  lovastatin  or another statin alone and subsequently determined that their patients need advicor to achieve desired cholesterol improvements 
similarly the company s ability to successfully sell increasing 
table of contents quantities of the advicor product may be adversely affected by the november release of zetia  part of a new class of cholesterol lowering agents  and by the september release of crestor  a new  highly powerful statin product 
zetia is being marketed by merck schering plough pharmaceuticals  which is a joint venture between merck co  inc and schering plough corporation  and crestor is marketed by astrazeneca 
merck schering plough pharmaceuticals and astrazeneca are competitors with substantially greater resources than kos 
zetia is part of a new class of cholesterol lowering agents that inhibit the intestinal absorption of cholesterol 
crestor is a type of statin drug that is highly effective in reducing ldl cholesterol  but is less effective in modifying hdl cholesterol  triglycerides and other forms of cholesterol 
the company s future sales of advicor may also be affected by the potential release of several other new combination statin drugs in the future 
further  there are at least nine versions of generic lovastatin  one of the components of advicor  that have been launched into the cholesterol market  which could adversely affect demand for advicor 
consequently  the company s effort to sell increasing quantities of the advicor product may be unsuccessful 
history of operating losses  uncertainty of future profitability to date  the company has dedicated most of its financial resources to the development and commercialization of the niaspan and advicor products  the development of other products  and general and administrative expenses 
the company has generated an accumulated deficit as of december   of approximately million 
excluding the impact of the bms payment  the company generated full year income before provision for income taxes for the first time in the company s ability to achieve and maintain profitability will depend  among other things  on the commercial success of the niaspan and advicor products  on the company s ability to successfully exploit the company s manufacturing and sales and marketing capabilities  on the company s ability to complete the development of  and obtain regulatory approvals for  and achieve market acceptance for the company s products under development  and on the company s ability to maintain sufficient funds to finance the company s activities 
as of december   the company had approximately million of net operating loss carryforwards and million of other deductible temporary differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
if the company is unable to achieve or sustain profitability  however  its carryforwards may not be utilized 
barr laboratories litigation on january   the company received notice from barr laboratories  inc barr that it had filed with the fda an abbreviated new drug application anda that  if approved  would allow barr to market a generic version of the company s mg niaspan product 
as a result  on march   the company filed a patent infringement lawsuit against barr in the southern district of new york sdny 
on march   the company filed an amended complaint the amended complaint 
in this lawsuit  the company asserted that barr has infringed kos  and  patents 
on march   barr answered the amended complaint the answer by denying that the and patents are valid and infringed  and seeking a declaratory judgment to that effect 
on august   barr amended its answer to add counterclaims requesting a declaratory judgment that two other patents owned by kos  us patent numbers  and  are not infringed  and that the patent is invalid 
on july   the company received notice from barr that it had filed an anda with the fda that would  if approved  allow barr to market generic versions of the company s mg and mg niaspan products 
on august   the company filed a second patent infringement lawsuit against barr also in the sdny 
again  the company asserted that barr has infringed the and patents 
on september   barr answered the complaint by denying infringement and alleging that the patents are invalid 
barr also sought a declaratory judgment that the    and patents are not infringed  and that the   and patents are invalid 
the two cases were consolidated on september  
table of contents on september   the company received notice from barr that it had filed a supplemental paragraph iv certification relating to kos  patent 
the company filed a third lawsuit on november   against barr in the sdny asserting infringement of this patent 
on december   barr answered the complaint by denying that the patent is valid and infringed  and seeking a declaratory judgment of invalidity 
barr also sought a declaratory judgment that the    and patents are not infringed  and that the  and patents are invalid 
the third case was consolidated with the first two on january  on march   kos replied to barr s declaratory judgment counterclaims by denying that kos patents are invalid or not infringed 
kos also sought a declaratory judgment that one or more of barr s products will infringe the and patents 
during the course of the litigation  barr has also suggested claims of anti trust and unenforceability 
kos has received several notices from barr laboratories that barr has filed a supplemental paragraph iv certification to each anda to provide for us patent no 
 the first notice was received by kos on january  and the latest on february  kos is currently evaluating its options 
this current litigation is costly and time consuming  and the company cannot assure that it will be successful 
in addition  such litigation may result in financial losses or harm to the company s reputation  and may divert management resources and attention from its operations 
if barr is successful in this litigation  the company s  and and patents could be found to be invalid  unenforceable or not infringed 
if such patents are invalid  unenforceable or not infringed  the company would be unable to prevent barr from marketing a generic version of the niaspan product  which would have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company would also be unable to prevent other companies from introducing generic and other competing products into the market place 
furthermore  there could be an increased risk that other companies would challenge the company s proprietary rights or claim that the company s products infringe on their patents 
future capital needs  uncertainty of additional funding 
in order to finance the company s operations  as of december   the company had million in outstanding borrowings from michael jaharis  the company s principal shareholder  director  and chairman emeritus 
the company can borrow up to an additional million from mr 
jaharis under agreements currently in place  provided that the conditions of borrowings have been satisfied including  without limitation  that the death of lender shall not have occurred  the lender  his spouse  children and entities they control continue to own at least of the common stock of the company  and no material adverse change shall have occurred to the company or its financial condition 
the repayment of funds borrowed from mr 
jaharis are secured by the pledge of all of the company s assets to him 
as a result  if the company is unable to repay the loans as they become due  the company could be forced to liquidate the company s assets or transfer all of such assets to mr 
jaharis 
the company has spent  and will continue to be required to spend  substantial funds to continue research and development activities  including clinical trials of the company s products under development  and to commercialize the niaspan and advicor products and the company s other products under development  if regulatory approvals are obtained for such products under development 
the company believes that it has sufficient resources  including funds available to it under loans from mr 
jaharis and the proceeds of the public offering completed in the last quarter of  to fund the company s operations through at least the next twelve months 
even with the proceeds from these sources  however  the company may need or elect to raise additional capital prior to such date 
the company s ability to fund its operating requirements and maintain an adequate level of working capital for the next twelve months will depend primarily on the near term commercial success of niaspan and advicor  its ability to meet the conditions necessary to obtain funding under its lines of credit  including  without limitation  that the death of the lender shall not have occurred  the lender  his spouse  children and entities they control continue to own at least of the common stock of the company  and no material adverse change shall have occurred to the company or its financial condition  the problems  delays  expenses and complications frequently encountered by companies at this stage of development  the progress of the company s research  development  and clinical trial programs  the costs and timing of seeking regulatory approvals of the company s products under development  the company s ability to obtain such 
table of contents regulatory approvals  costs in filing  prosecuting  defending  and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the extent and terms of any collaborative research  manufacturing  marketing  or other arrangements  and changes in economic  regulatory  or competitive conditions or the company s planned business 
estimates about the adequacy of funding for the company s activities are based on certain assumptions  including assumptions regarding the marketing and sales success of the niaspan and advicor products  the regulatory and commercial success of the advicor product  and that testing and regulatory procedures relating to the company s other products under development can be conducted at projected costs and within projected time frames 
to the extent these assumptions prove to be inaccurate  the company may have insufficient resources to fund its operations as currently planned 
to satisfy the company s capital requirements  it may seek to raise funds in the public or private capital markets 
the company s ability to raise additional funds in the public markets may be adversely affected if sales of the niaspan and advicor products do not increase rapidly  if the results of the clinical trials for the company s products under development are not favorable  or if regulatory approval for any of the company s products under development is not obtained 
the company may seek additional funding through corporate collaborations and other financing vehicles 
if adequate funds are not available to the company  or if available  their terms are unacceptable  the company may be required to significantly reduce its marketing activities for the niaspan and advicor products or curtail significantly one or more of the company s research or development programs or the company may be required to obtain funds through arrangements with future collaborative partners or others that may require the company to relinquish rights to the niaspan or advicor products or to some or all of the company s technologies or products under development or take significant cost reducing actions or both 
if the company is successful in obtaining additional financing  the terms of the financing may have the effect of diluting or adversely affecting the holdings or the rights of the holders of the company s securities 
registration rights the company has granted certain registration rights to its controlling shareholder  mr 
jaharis  his spouse  and their transferees  and to kos investments  inc and kos holdings  inc  which entitle such persons and entities to cause the company to effect an unlimited number of registrations under the securities act of of sales of up to an aggregate of  shares of the company s common stock owned or controlled by such persons or entities or that could be acquired by such person or entities upon exercise or conversion of securities they currently hold 
these registration rights generally would also permit the holders of such rights to include shares in any registration statement otherwise filed by the company 
by exercising these registration rights  these persons and entities could cause a large number of shares to be registered and become freely tradeable without restrictions under the securities act except for those purchased in the offering by the company s affiliates immediately upon the effectiveness of such registration 
such sales may have an adverse effect on the market price of the company s common stock and could impair the company s ability to raise additional capital 
limited sales and marketing resources although the company and takeda currently market the niaspan and advicor products and the company intends to market its products under development primarily through the company s own specialty sales force or through co promotion partners  substantial resources will continue to be required for kos to promote the sale of its products 
because its current marketing resources are limited  the company may be unable to devote sufficient resources to the niaspan and advicor products  or to the company s products under development or to be acquired or licensed  or to achieve increasing market acceptance of such products 
the company s failure to expend the resources to adequately promote the niaspan and advicor products or its other products under development would have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 

table of contents moreover  because the company has fewer sales persons than its competitors  the company s sales force may be unable to detail successfully physicians who prescribe lipid altering or other medications 
the company may not be able to retain its current sales representatives 
even if the company hires additional representatives  they may not be immediately effective in promoting the sale of the niaspan and advicor products 
as a result  kos may be unable to generate significantly increased sales of the niaspan or advicor products 
the failure of the company s sales representatives to generate increased sales of the niaspan and advicor products would have a material adverse effect on operating results 
control by existing shareholder michael jaharis  the company s principal shareholder and a director  owns  directly or indirectly   shares of the company s common stock as of december   or approximately of the common stock outstanding 
accordingly  mr 
jaharis can control the outcome of certain shareholder votes  including votes concerning the election of directors  the adoption or amendment of provisions in the company s articles of incorporation  and the approval of mergers and other significant corporate transactions 
this level of concentrated ownership by one person may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in the management or voting control of kos 
in addition  a line of credit gives mr 
jaharis the right to exercise warrants to purchase six million shares of the company s common stock at per share 
the warrants are non detachable and can be exercised only through the conversion of principal and interest accumulated under the line of credit 
if this warrant exercise was to occur  mr 
jaharis direct or indirect ownership of the company s common stock would increase to  shares  or approximately of the common stock outstanding  assuming the warrant exercise had occurred as of december  competition and technological change many products are commercially available for the treatment of elevated ldl cholesterol  and the manufacturers of such products  individually and collectively  have significantly greater financial resources and sales and manufacturing capabilities than those available to kos  including combined field sales forces exceeding  persons  compared with the company s approximately person field sales force and the sales force of its co promotion partners 
the company s direct competitors and their respective competitive products include  among others abbott tricor bristol myers squibb pravachol merck zocor and mevacor novartis lescol pfizer lipitor and lopid sankyo welchol merck schering plough zetia astrazeneca crestor the company estimates that the existing niaspan and advicor prescriptions account for slightly more than of the total prescriptions currently being written in the united states for cholesterol lowering pharmaceutical compounds 
in addition  zetia  part of a new class of cholesterol lowering agents that inhibit the intestinal absorption of cholesterol  was launched in november by merck schering plough pharmaceuticals  and crestor  a new highly powerful statin product  was launched during september by astrazeneca 
both merck schering plough pharmaceuticals and astrazeneca are competitors who have substantially greater resources than those available to kos 
further  other new combination statin drugs may be marketed during succeeding years 
finally  there are at least nine versions of generic lovastatin  one of the components of advicor  currently being marketed in the cholesterol market 
the existence of distributors of generic lovastatin and the competitive environment 
table of contents they create may inhibit the niaspan and advicor products from competing successfully or from achieving increased sales 
moreover  the active ingredient in niaspan  niacin  is available in several other formulations  most of which do not require a prescription 
although the company believes that there are no other currently available niacin formulations that have been approved by the fda specifically for once a day dosing  physicians may decide to prescribe or recommend some of these unapproved niacin formulations  using the niaspan product s dosing regimen  to try to achieve the same results as niaspan 
substitution of other niacin formulations for the niaspan product could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
moreover  manufacturers of other niacin formulations could promote their products using the niaspan product s dosing regimen and could promote the sale of their products to treat the indications for which the company has received clearance to market niaspan 
although such promotion would be a violation of fda regulations  the significant occurrence of such practices would have a material adverse effect on the company 
moreover  many established pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  universities  and other research institutions with resources significantly greater than kos may develop products that directly compete with the company s products 
even if the company s products under development prove to be more effective than those developed by other entities  such other entities may be more successful in marketing their products than kos because of greater financial resources  stronger sales and marketing efforts  and other factors 
if these entities are successful in developing products that are safer  more effective  or less costly than the products developed by kos  the company s products may be unable to compete successfully with any of those products 
international commercialization agreement with merck kgaa on october   the company signed an exclusive international commercialization agreement with merck to market the niaspan and advicor products outside the united states  canada and japan 
under terms of the merck agreement  merck will provide kos up to million in licensing  milestone and reimbursement payments  including million in upfront payments 
kos is responsible for obtaining initial marketing authorization in all european countries and the supply and manufacturing of the products 
pursuant to the merck agreement  if marketing authorization is not obtained for niaspan or advicor in certain countries and within certain timeframes  merck will have the right to terminate the agreement  and kos will be required to refund to merck up to million of the upfront payments 
in addition  other milestone payments payable to kos under the merck agreement are dependent on the achievement of marketing authorization of niaspan in certain countries  the achievement of marketing authorization of advicor in certain countries  and achieving certain net sales thresholds of niaspan and advicor 
in  kos received marketing approval for niaspan in the united kingdom  and in  submitted advicor for marketing approval in the united kingdom 
we entered niaspan into the european union s mutual recognition procedure mrp in september in january  the mrp for niaspan was successfully completed with the company receiving tentative approval to market niaspan in thirteen european countries 
there is no certainty that final marketing authorization for the niaspan and advicor products will be obtained under the mrp  or  with respect to advicor  at all  and there could be delays in the granting of such authorizations 
consequently  kos may be required to reimburse merck for up to million of the upfront payments and may not receive any of the milestone payments under the merck agreement 
no assurance of adequate third party reimbursement the company s ability to commercialize successfully its products under development is dependent in part on the extent to which appropriate levels of reimbursement for the niaspan and advicor products  or for the other products it sells are obtained from government authorities  private health insurers  and managed care organizations such as health maintenance organizations or hmos 
the company estimates that  through december   approximately million  or  of the company s cumulative 
table of contents niaspan and advicor revenue has been subjected to the reimbursement rules of such organizations 
managed care organizations and other third party payors are increasingly challenging the pricing of pharmaceutical products 
the trend toward managed healthcare in the united states  the growth of organizations such as hmos  and legislative proposals to reform healthcare and government insurance programs could significantly influence the purchase of pharmaceutical products  resulting in lower prices and reduced demand for niaspan  the advicor product  or the company s products under development 
such cost containment measures and potential legislative reform could affect the company s ability to sell niaspan  advicor  or its products under development and may have a material adverse effect on the company 
significant uncertainty exists about the reimbursement status of newly approved pharmaceutical products 
although the company has obtained approvals for reimbursement for the cost of niaspan and advicor from many third party payors  such approvals  in the united states and in foreign countries  may be discontinued for niaspan  or unavailable for advicor or any of the company s products under development 
the unavailability or inadequacy of third party reimbursement for niaspan  advicor  or the company s products under development or to be acquired or licensed  may reduce the demand for  or negatively affect the price of  these products  which would have a material adverse effect on the company 
dependence on collaborators the company relies on various third parties for certain aspects of the development  manufacture and promotion of the company s present and planned products 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to enter into future collaborative arrangements on favorable terms  or at all 
even if the company is successful in entering into such collaborative agreements  there can be no assurance that any such arrangement will be successful 
the success of any such arrangement is dependent on  among other things  the skills  experience and efforts of the third party s employees responsible for the project  the third party s commitment to the arrangement  and the financial condition of the third party  all of which are beyond the control of the company 
dependence on key personnel the company s success is dependent on the company s ability to attract and retain highly qualified scientific  management  and sales personnel 
in april  the company hired its current president and chief executive officer  adrian adams 
the loss of mr 
adams as the company s president and chief executive officer could have a material adverse effect on its operations and business 
due to intense competition for personnel from other companies  academic institutions  government entities  and other organizations  the company may be unsuccessful in attracting and retaining key personnel 
the loss of key personnel  or the inability to attract and retain the additional  highly skilled employees required for the expansion of kos activities  could adversely affect its business and operating results 
products under development although the company has obtained clearance from the fda to market the niaspan and advicor products  the company may be unsuccessful in effectively formulating any of its other products as planned 
further  the company may not be successful in demonstrating the safety and efficacy of such products in human clinical trials 
these trials may be costly and time consuming 
the administration of any product the company develops may produce undesirable side effects that could result in the interruption  delay or suspension of clinical trials  or the failure to obtain fda or other regulatory approval for any or all targeted indications 
even if regulatory approval is secured  the company s products under development may later produce adverse effects that limit or prevent their widespread use or that necessitate their withdrawal from the market 
the company may discontinue the development of any of its products under development at any time 

table of contents acquisition of products as part of the company s growth strategy  the company intends to acquire and develop additional product candidates or approved products 
the success of this strategy depends upon kos ability to identify  select and acquire pharmaceutical products that meet the criteria it has established 
any product candidate the company acquires will require additional research and development efforts prior to commercial sale  including extensive pre clinical and or clinical testing and approval by the fda and corresponding foreign regulatory authorities 
all product candidates are prone to the risks of failure inherent in pharmaceutical product development  including the possibility that the product candidate will not be safe  non toxic and effective or approved by regulatory authorities 
in addition  the company cannot assure that any approved products that the company develops or acquires will be manufactured or produced economically  successfully commercialized  widely accepted in the marketplace or that the company will be able to recover its significant expenditures in connection with the development or acquisition of such products 
in addition  proposing  negotiating and implementing an economically viable acquisition is a lengthy and complex process 
other companies  including those with substantially greater financial  marketing and sales resources  may compete with the company for the acquisition of product candidates and approved products 
the company may not be able to acquire the rights to additional product candidates and approved products on terms that it finds acceptable  or at all 
in addition  if the company acquires product candidates from third parties  the company will be dependent on third parties to supply such products to the company for sale 
the company could be materially adversely affected by the failure or inability of such suppliers to meet performance  reliability and quality standards 
patents and trademarks  interference the company s ability to commercialize any of its products under development will depend  in part  on the company s or on its licensors ability to obtain patents  enforce those patents  preserve trade secrets  and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of third parties 
in addition  the patents that the company has been issued or for which kos has applied relating to niaspan  advicor and certain of the company s products under development are based on  among other things  the extended release nature of the niacin active ingredient 
if the indications treated by niaspan  advicor and such other products under development could be treated using drugs without such extended release properties  such patents and patent applications may not prevent the use of other niacin based drugs for the treatment of such indications  which would have a material adverse effect on the company 
further  the company would be adversely affected if the patent applications licensed to or owned by kos do not result in issued patents  meaningful patent protection is not secured for any particular technology  or any patents that have been or may be issued to kos or the company s licensors  including the patents covering the company s niaspan product  are invalid  unenforceable or not infringed 
in general  the us patents and patent applications owned by or licensed to kos are directed to compositions and their methods of use 
protection of the chemical entity is not available for the active ingredient in niaspan  or either of the active ingredients in advicor 
moreover  the active ingredient in niaspan  niacin  is currently sold in the united states and other markets for lipid altering indications and for other uses 
the additional active ingredient in advicor  lovastatin  is also currently sold in the united states and other markets for lipid altering indications 
even in jurisdictions where the use of the active ingredients in niaspan and advicor for lipid altering and other indications may be covered by the claims of method of use or composition patents owned by or licensed to kos  off label sales might occur  especially if another company markets the active ingredient at a price that is less than the price of niaspan or advicor  thereby potentially reducing the sales of such products 

table of contents the us patent and trademark office the pto has issued us patent numbers    and  to the company with claims related to niaspan s and advicor s composition and method of use consistent with the recommended once a day regime 
on february   the company entered into an agreement with a generic manufacturer pursuant to which the company and the manufacturer granted cross licenses to each other under their respective patents 
the company has subsequently purchased the patents that were the subject of the cross license agreement and agreed to continue paying a royalty to the manufacturer on terms similar to those contained in the cross license agreement 
the company has received patents and has filed patent applications covering technologies pertaining to propellant driven aerosol formulations that do not contain chlorofluorocarbons 
the company is aware that certain european and us patents have been issued with claims covering products that contain certain propellant driven aerosol formulations that do not contain chlorofluorocarbons 
it may be argued that certain or all of the company s aerosol products under development may use a formulation covered by such european or us patents 
if that is shown to be the case  the company would be prevented from making  using or selling such products unless kos obtains a license under such patents  which license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms  or at all  or unless such patents are determined to be invalid in europe or invalid or unenforceable in the united states 
the company s development of products that may be covered by such patents and its failure to obtain licenses under such patents in the event such patents are determined to be valid and enforceable could have an adverse effect on the company s business 
on january   the company received notice from barr laboratories  inc barr that it had filed with the fda an abbreviated new drug application anda that would  if approved  allow barr to market a generic version of the company s mg niaspan product 
as a result  on march   the company filed a patent infringement lawsuit against barr in the southern district of new york sdny 
on march   the company filed an amended complaint the amended complaint 
in this lawsuit  the company asserted that barr has infringed the and patents

on august   barr amended its answer to add counterclaims requesting a declaratory judgment that two other patents owned by kos  us patent numbers  and  are not infringed  and that the patent is invalid 
on july   the company received notice from barr that it had filed an anda with the fda that would  if approved  allow barr to market generic versions of the company s mg and mg niaspan products 
on august   the company filed a second patent infringement lawsuit against barr also in the sdny 
again  the company asserted that barr has infringed the and patents 
on september   barr answered the complaint by denying infringement and alleging that the patents are invalid 
barr also sought a declaratory judgment that the    and patents are not infringed  and that the   and patents are invalid 
the two cases were consolidated on september  on september   the company received notice from barr that it had filed a supplemental paragraph iv certification relating to kos patent 
the company filed a third lawsuit on november   against barr in the sdny asserting infringement of this patent 
on december   barr answered the complaint by denying that the patent is valid and infringed  and seeking a declaratory judgment of invalidity 
barr also sought a declaratory judgment that the    and patents are not infringed  and that the  and patents are invalid 
the third case was consolidated with the first two on january  on march   kos replied to barr s declaratory judgment counterclaims by denying that kos patents are invalid or not infringed 
kos also sought a declaratory judgment that one or more of barr s products will infringe the and patents 
during the course of the litigation  barr has also suggested claims of anti trust and 
table of contents unenforceability 
kos has received several notices from barr laboratories that barr has filed a supplemental paragraph iv certification to each anda to provide for us patent no 
 the first notice was received by kos on january  and the latest on february  kos is currently evaluating its options 
on august   the company filed a trademark infringement lawsuit against andrx corporation and andrx laboratories  inc andrx in the us district court for the district of new jersey based on andrx s use of the mark altocor for its cholesterol product 
in conjunction with its complaint  the company also filed a motion for preliminary injunction the same day 
andrx filed an opposition to the motion for preliminary injunction on august  andrx answered the company s complaint on september  the company filed its reply in support of its motion for preliminary injunction on september  oral argument on the motion for preliminary injunction was held on september  an order denying the motion for preliminary injunction was entered september  the company filed a notice of appeal to the order denying the preliminary injunction on september   and a motion for expedited consideration of the appeal on october   in the third circuit 
andrx filed a motion in opposition of expedited consideration on october   and the company replied october  the company s motion for expedited review of the appeal was granted on october  on november   the company filed its third circuit appellate brief  andrx filed a brief in opposition december   and the company filed its reply brief december  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in defending its patents in the barr litigation 
if the company is not successful in defending its patents  barr and other competitors may be able to produce and market generic version of its niaspan products  which could be sold at prices lower than those charged by the company 
this would have a material adverse effect on the company s business and financial results 
the company is unable to estimate the economic impact if it is not successful in defending its patents 
because the patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions  the patents owned and licensed by kos  or any future patents  may not prevent other companies from developing competing products or ensure that others will not be issued patents that may prevent the sale of the company s products or require licensing and the payment of significant fees or royalties 
furthermore  to the extent that any of the company s future products or methods are not patentable  such products or methods infringe upon the patents of third parties  or the company s patents or future patents fail to give kos an exclusive position in the subject matter to which those patents relate  the company will be adversely affected 
the company may be unable to avoid infringement of third party patents and may have to obtain a license  or defend an infringement action and challenge the validity of the patents in court 
a license may be unavailable on terms and conditions acceptable to the company  if at all 
patent litigation is costly and time consuming  and the company may be unable to prevail in any such patent litigation or devote sufficient resources to even pursue such litigation 
if the company does not obtain a license under such patents  or if it is found liable for infringement and if it is not able to have such patents declared invalid  the company may be liable for significant money damages  may encounter significant delays in bringing products to market  or may be precluded from participating in the manufacture  use  or sale of products or methods of treatment requiring such licenses 
government regulation  no assurances of regulatory approval the company s research and development activities  preclinical studies  clinical trials  and the manufacturing and marketing of the company s products are subject to extensive regulation by the fda 
the drug development and approval process takes many years and requires the expenditure of substantial resources 
data obtained from preclinical and clinical activities are susceptible to varying interpretations that could delay  limit  or prevent regulatory approval 
although the company may consult the fda for 
table of contents guidance in developing protocols for clinical trials  despite such consultation  the fda may find the clinical trials inadequate or not well controlled 
they may also reject the results of those trials altogether 
in addition  delays or rejections of applications for regulatory approval may result from changes in or additions to fda regulations concerning the drug approval process 
thus  regulatory reviews may be untimely and regulatory approvals could be denied for products developed by the company 
even if regulatory approval of a product is obtained  the approval will be limited as to the indicated uses for which it may be promoted or marketed 
in addition  a marketed drug  its bulk chemical supplier  its manufacturer  and its manufacturing facilities are subject to continual regulatory review and periodic inspections  and later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product  supplier  manufacturer  or facility may result in restrictions on such products or manufacturers  which may require a withdrawal of the product from the market 
failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements in the united states or abroad can  among other things  result in fines  suspensions of regulatory approvals  seizure of products  product recalls  operating restrictions  and criminal prosecution  any of which could have a material adverse effect on kos 
outside the united states  the company s research and development activities  preclinical studies  clinical trials  and the manufacturing and marketing of the company s products are subject to extensive foreign regulation 
in the european union  the approval of new drugs is governed by the central approval or mutual recognition procedures of the european medicines evaluation agency emea 
in  the company received marketing approval for niaspan in the united kingdom  and in  submitted advicor for marketing approval in the united kingdom 
pursuant to the merck agreement  the company is responsible for obtaining initial marketing authorization for the niaspan or advicor products in all countries in the european union 
there could be delays or rejections in applications for regulatory approval in europe and in other countries  as well a requirement of completion of additional preclinical and clinical studies 
the process of obtaining regulatory approval could be costly 
in addition  competitors of the company may obtain regulatory approval for similar products 
even if regulatory approval of a product is obtained  the approval will be limited as to the indicated uses for which it may be promoted or marketed  and the product will be subject to a continual regulatory review and inspections  which  if previously unknown problems are discovered  may result in restrictions on the products and manufacturers  which may require a withdrawal of the product from the market 
in addition  individual countries will have pricing  third party reimbursement and labeling approvals necessary for the manufacture  distribution  use and sale of products with which the company must comply 
moreover  because the legislative and regulatory environment continues to evolve in the us and abroad  it is difficult to predict the impact of legislation and regulations on the company and its products 
in july  the division of drug marketing  advertising  and communication at the fda issued a warning letter to kos related to an advertisement the company ran in a healthcare section of time magazine 
the advertisement  which the company intended to run only one time  was designed to increase awareness of the company s niaspan product 
in its warning letter  the fda objected to the advertisement on the grounds that the advertisement failed to reflect a fair balance of the contraindications  warnings  precautions  and side effects of the company s niaspan product 
the fda also objected to the advertisement on the grounds that the advertisement overstated the efficacy of the niaspan product in light of its approved labeling 
subsequent to this event  the company reached agreement with the fda to remedy their objections by placing a new advertisement with content that adequately characterizes the risks and other safety implications for the product 
the company s business is also subject to regulation under state  federal and local laws  rules  regulations  and policies relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety  including those governing the use  generation  manufacture  storage  air emission  effluent discharge  handling  and disposal of certain materials 
the company believes that it is in compliance in all material respects with all such laws  rules  regulations  and policies applicable to kos 
however  non compliance with such environmental and health and safety laws and regulations in the future would require kos to incur 
table of contents significant costs to comply 
the company s research and development involves the controlled use of hazardous materials 
although the company believes that its safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials comply with the standards prescribed by applicable state  federal  and local regulations  the risk of contamination or injury from these materials cannot be completely eliminated 
in the event of such contamination or injury  the company could be held liable for any damages that result and any such liability could exceed its resources and materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
manufacturing on december   the fda issued the company a warning letter related to a routine  unannounced inspection of the company s principal manufacturing facility located in edison  new jersey 
the letter cited four deficiencies in the company s quality systems 
the company is working diligently to remedy these deficiencies  and plans to cooperate fully with the fda to take any corrective action that may be required to further assure the quality of the company s products 
based upon the observations noted in the december warning letter  the company is not currently in compliance with cgmp 
although such status does not prohibit kos from producing product for commercial sale  this status may result in a delay in the approval by the fda of any pending company sponsored regulatory applications 
it may also contribute to a delay in the company s marketing partner s receipt of final product approval in certain foreign countries 
further  if appropriate corrective actions are not taken in response to the issues raised in the december warning letter  the fda  upon re inspection of the company s edison manufacturing facility  may impose additional regulatory sanctions that may include withdrawal or seizure from the market of kos products 
the company s manufacturing facilities are and will continue to be subject to ongoing  periodic inspection by the fda and state agencies to ensure compliance with cgmp 
the company s failure to follow and document the company s adherence to such cgmp regulations or other regulatory requirements may lead to significant delays in the availability of the company s products  including the niaspan and advicor products  for commercial use or clinical study  may result in the termination or hold of a clinical study  or may delay or prevent filing or approval of marketing applications for kos products 
the company also may encounter problems with  among other things  the following achieving consistent and acceptable production yield and costs  meeting product release specifications  quality control and assurance  shortages of qualified manufacturing personnel  shortages of raw materials  shortages of key contractors  and ongoing compliance with fda and other regulations 
any of the foregoing could result in the company being unable to manufacture and supply sufficient quantities of its niaspan and advicor products to meet the demands of its customers  or to fulfill orders from its international marketing partner 
in addition  the resolution of the concerns raised by the fda in its recent warning letter could result in the company being required to implement manufacturing  testing or other procedures that could materially reduce the efficiency of the company s manufacturing and supply capability and could reduce the amount of quantities of the company s products that the company has available for sale 
the company s failure for any reason to manufacture and supply sufficient quantities of the niaspan and advicor products would have a material adverse impact on the company and its financial condition 
the extent of such adverse effect would depend on the nature  timing  scope 
table of contents and duration of the manufacturing issues 
although the company is currently in discussions with a contract manufacturer  the company does not currently have a qualified backup manufacturing capability with a third party 
failure to comply with applicable manufacturing regulations could also result in sanctions being imposed on the company  including fines  injunctions  civil penalties  failure of regulatory authorities to grant marketing approval of the company s products  delays  suspension or withdrawal of approvals  license revocation  seizures or recalls of products  operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions  any of which could harm the company s business 
if the company is unable to manufacture its products for any reason  the company s options for outsourcing manufacturing are currently limited 
it would take a substantial period of time for a contract manufacturing facility that has not been producing the company s particular products to begin producing them under cgmp regulations 
limited manufacturing experience  risk of scale up the company currently manufactures the niaspan and advicor products in one manufacturing plant in edison  new jersey that has been inspected and approved by the fda for both niaspan and advicor 
although both products have been approved for manufacture in the edison facility  the company has limited experience in manufacturing products for commercial sale in the edison facility and inefficiencies may exist in the manufacturing process 
the company may need to further scale up certain of the company s current manufacturing processes to achieve production levels consistent with the commercial sale of its products for both the us and international use 
further  modifications to the facilities  systems  and procedures may be necessary to maintain capacity at a level sufficient to meet market demand or to maintain compliance with current good manufacturing practices regulations and other regulations prescribed by various regulatory agencies including the occupational safety and health administration and the environmental protection agency 
the company s failure to successfully further scale up  expand in connection with manufacture for commercial sale  or modify the company s manufacturing process or to comply with current good manufacturing practices regulations and other regulations could delay the approval of its products under development or limit its ability to meet the demand for its products  any of which would have a material adverse effect on kos 
such occurrences may require kos to acquire alternative means of manufacturing the company s products  which may not be available on a timely basis  on commercially practicable terms  or at all 
dependence on single sources of supply some materials used in the company s products  including the active ingredients in niaspan and advicor  are currently sourced from single qualified suppliers 
the company has not established arrangements with alternative suppliers for these ingredients  although the company believes that it can obtain an alternative supply of lovastatin  one of the two active ingredients in advicor  if necessary 
although the company has maintained a business relationship with its niacin supplier since  and has not experienced difficulty to date in acquiring niacin  or other materials for product development  additional product validations and regulatory submissions would be required if supply interruptions were to occur in the future or if the company had to obtain substitute materials 
similarly  the company s source for lovastatin is relatively inexperienced as a supplier of such ingredient 
although the company has maintained a business relationship with its lovastatin supplier since  and this supplier is experienced as a supplier of other pharmaceutical grade active ingredients  this supplier may be unable to meet the company s requirements for lovastatin on a sustained basis  at an acceptable quality standard  or at a commercially viable price 
in such an event  the company would be forced to obtain an alternative supplier of lovastatin 
any interruption of raw material supply  for any reason  in any of the required ingredients for the company s products could have a material adverse effect on kos ability to manufacture its products or to obtain or maintain regulatory approval of such products 
in the event that the company consummates its transaction with aventis and acquires the azmacort product  the company will rely on aventis to manufacture and supply adequate quantities of the finished 
table of contents azmacort product 
although there is one other company that is currently qualified to manufacture and supply the azmacort product  the company does not have any contractual arrangement with such other entity 
as a result  the company will rely solely on aventis to supply the company with the azmacort product  and the company cannot provide any assurances that aventis will be able to produce sufficient quantities of the azmacort product to meet the company s requirements 
the azmacort product can be difficult to produce and requires the assembly of several different components  the unavailability of any of which can result in an interruption in the supply of finished azmacort products to the company 
the manufacture and assembly of each of the components  in addition to the qualification of the raw materials used in the finished azmacort product  is subject to regulatory approval 
if kos  aventis or aventis suppliers are unable to maintain the regulatory approval for such components  raw materials or finished product  or are unable to manufacture and store them in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements  aventis may not be able to supply the company with sufficient quantities of the finished azmacort product 
the company is dependent on the performance by aventis and its suppliers for the manufacture and supply of the finished azmacort products  and the company cannot provide any assurance of their willingness or ability to perform their manufacturing responsibilities in the future 
any interruption of supply  for any reason  of the finished azmacort product to the company would have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
risk of product liability claims  no assurance of adequate insurance manufacturing  marketing  selling  and testing niaspan  advicor  and the company s products under development or to be acquired or licensed  entails a risk of product liability 
on august   bayer ag  removed its statin product  baycol  from the market because of multiple deaths attributed to a rare form of a muscle disorder called rhabdomyolysis 
as a result of the removal of baycol from the market  however  the side affects of statin products have been subject to increased scrutiny 
although the statin component of advicor has been approved by the fda and marketed for nearly years and is a different drug compound than that which was used in baycol  to the extent that patients who take advicor develop serious adverse side affects  such as rhabdomyolysis  or associate the adverse events experienced by some baycol patients with all other statin products  including the company s advicor product  it would have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
the company could be subject to product liability claims in the event that its products or products under development fail to perform as intended 
even unsuccessful claims could result in the expenditure of funds in litigation and the diversion of management time and resources and could damage the company s reputation and impair the marketability of its products 
while the company currently maintains liability insurance  the company may not be able to maintain such insurance at a commercially reasonable cost 
if a successful claim were made against the company  and the amount of insurance were inadequate to cover the costs of defending against or paying such a claim  or the damages payable by kos  the company would experience a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition  and results of operations and on the price of the company s common stock 
possible stock price volatility the stock market  including the nasdaq national market  on which the company s shares are listed  has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that may be unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
in addition  the market price of the company s common stock  like the stock prices of many publicly traded pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  has been and may continue to be highly volatile 

table of contents the following table sets forth  for the fiscal periods indicated  the range of high and low prices for trades of the company s common stock on the nasdaq national market system 
high low year ended december  first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter year ended december  first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter year ended december  first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter year ended december  first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter the sale by the company s controlling shareholder or members of the company s management of shares of common stock  announcements of technological innovations or new commercial products by the company or its competitors  developments or disputes concerning patent or proprietary rights  publicity regarding actual or potential medical results relating to the niaspan and advicor products or to products under development by kos or its competitors  regulatory developments in either the united states or foreign countries  public concern as to the safety of pharmaceutical and biotechnology products  and economic and other external factors  as well as the trend of prescriptions for the niaspan product and the advicor product after its launch and the period to period fluctuations in sales or other financial results  among other factors  may have a significant impact on the market price of the company s common stock 
anti takeover provisions certain provisions of the company s articles of incorporation and bylaws generally permit removal of directors only for cause by a vote of the shareholders  require a vote of the shareholders to amend the company s articles of incorporation and bylaws  require a demand of at least of the company s shareholders to call a special meeting of shareholders  and prohibit shareholder actions by written consent 
certain of such provisions also allow the board of directors to authorize the issuance of preferred stock with rights superior to those of the common stock 
moreover  provisions of the florida business corporation act  to which the company is subject  prohibit the voting of shares that are acquired in certain takeovers without the approval of the board of directors or the approval by a majority 
table of contents of the corporation s voting shares 
accordingly  the forgoing provisions could prevent the removal of the company s current directors and management  or discourage a third party from attempting to acquire  or make it more difficult for a third party to acquire  control of kos 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s exposure to market risk is limited primarily to fluctuating interest rates associated with variable rate indebtedness that is subject to interest rate changes in the united states 
the company does not use  nor has it historically used  derivative financial instruments to manage or reduce market risk 
at december   the company had million of variable rate indebtedness bearing interest at the prime rate at december
