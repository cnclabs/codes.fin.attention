the company s products are directed at both the retail consumer channel and the safety and industrial channel of distribution 
economic indicators that are important to our business include consumer confidence and unemployment rate trends 
increasing consumer confidence trends improve retail channel product sales  and decreasing unemployment trends improve safety and industrial channel sales 
operationally  gross margins are an important determining factor in funding marketing  sales and product development costs  in addition to producing profits 
margin growth of basis points  in part  allowed the company to return to profitability this year 
expense management and cost control is a given in today s market as price stability is the norm 
therefore  our expense controls and productivity improvements will contribute to profits as well 
in  excluding one time expenses in of approximately million  we reduced expenses by million 
we continue to look for ways to leverage systems and streamline processes  and we are seeing expanded use of our business to business information and ordering portal that we market as outpost 
from a working capital and return on equity standpoint  management of our accounts receivable and inventory is key 
we are focused on improving asset turns as evidenced by our reduction in days sales outstanding measured by using fourth quarter sales and year end receivables  and inventory turnover as measured by cost of goods sold divided by average inventory 
at the end of  our days sales outstanding declined from to days as compared to  and our inventory turns for improved to from turns in driving more sales through fewer products and shelf keeping units sku s will create improved asset turns 
these asset management improvements  and our improved profitability led to a million reduction in funded debt defined as total short and long term debt during we continue to generate more sales in the second half of the year  due to our cold and wet weather product offerings 
we are augmenting our offerings with more year round work and uniform products  as well as spring offerings of outdoor cross training products 
weather  especially in the fall and winter  will continue to be a risk factor in our results 
we principally examine success of products and markets by reviewing the growth of our channels of distribution and brands 
accordingly  during  we grew sales in the danner brand by  and the net sales in the retail channel of lacrosse brand products were essentially equal to safety and industrial channel sales of lacrosse and rainfair products declined by in  partially as a result of our decision to narrow the product offerings in that division 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales net sales in decreased million  or  to million from million in the decrease in net sales was due to a decrease in the safety and industrial channel of lacrosse and rainfair brand products  partially offset by a increase in danner brand products over net sales in the retail channel of lacrosse brand products in were essentially equal to the overall decrease is the result of a strategic reduction in lower margin sales  and a reduction in the number of products being offered for sale  particularly in the private label and mass merchant markets in the safety and industrial channel of distribution 
gross profit gross profit in increased million  or  to million from million in as a percent of sales  gross profit improved to in  from in  an improvement of basis points 
the increase in gross profit as a percent of sales is primarily due to improvements in our sourcing capabilities  lower manufacturing variances and a reduction in sales of lower margin products 
both and were favorably impacted by a million and million reduction in the lifo inventory reserve  as the manufactured pool of inventory was reduced 
selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses decreased million  or  to million from million in during  we recorded million of charges associated with the move of the corporate headquarters to portland  oregon from la crosse  wisconsin million and the move of the safety and industrial division to portland  oregon from racine  wisconsin million 
factoring out one time charges in  the company decreased selling and administrative expenses approximately million mainly as a result of the consolidation of company functions from several facilities to locations in portland  oregon and la crosse  wisconsin and leveraging internal systems and operating efficiencies 
non operating expenses non operating expenses in decreased million  or  to million from million in the decrease is primarily a result of a decrease in interest expense that was the result of lower average borrowings and lower interest rates 
income taxes no income tax provision has been presented for due to the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards and a reduction in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
due to the uncertainty surrounding the realization and timing of the benefits from the company s deferred tax assets  the company has recorded a valuation allowance on its otherwise recognizable deferred tax assets 
once the company has attained a sustained level of profitability  the need for such a valuation allowance will be reconsidered 
during  the company recognized an income tax benefit of million due to tax provisions enacted as part of the job creation and worker assistance act of the law extended the loss carryback period for certain losses from two to five years allowing the company to carryback certain losses incurred during to reduce taxable income from and as a result  the company received a tax refund of approximately million during direct charge to equity during  the company recorded a million charge directly to equity as a result of recognizing the minimum pension liability 
in  the charge to equity was reduced by million to million 
the charge is necessary when the accumulated benefit obligation is in excess of the sums of the respective plan assets and accrued pension liabilities  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales net sales in decreased million  or to million from million in the decrease in net sales was due to a decrease in the retail channel of distribution of lacrosse brand products  a decrease in the industrial channel of distribution of lacrosse and rainfair brand products  partially offset by a sales increase for the danner brand products over the same period of last year 
these decreases were the result of a softening economy on retailers and industrial distributors and reduced fill in business for cold weather products in the lacrosse brand retail channel 
in addition  the company discontinued manufacturing children s insulated footwear which resulted in of the retail channel decrease in net sales 
net sales in the industrial channel of distribution declined from as a result of management s decision to discontinue the mass market apparel business and reduce the number of retail channel products offered in the industrial channel of distribution 
the sales increase in danner brand products was primarily related to the introduction of new styles using the terra force technology platform within the uniform  hunting  work and outdoor cross training product lines 
gross profit gross profit in decreased million  or to million from million in as a percent of sales  gross profit increased to in compared to in the increase in gross profit as a percent of sales is primarily due to our focus on shifting to higher margin sourced products and a one time charge of million during the first half of related to closing the la crosse factory

direct charge to equity during  the company recorded a million charge directly to equity as a result of recognizing the minimum pension liability 
the charge is necessary when the accumulated benefits obligation is in excess of the sums of the respective plan assets and accrued pension liabilities  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources we have historically funded working capital requirements and capital expenditures with cash generated from operations and borrowings under a revolving credit agreement or other long term lending arrangements 
we require working capital to support fluctuating accounts receivable and inventory levels caused by our seasonal business cycle 
borrowing requirements are generally the lowest in the first quarter and the highest during the third quarter 
our current revolving credit agreement  which expires in june  provides for advances based on a percentage of eligible accounts receivable and inventory with maximum borrowings of million 
the current credit agreement will be used to support working capital requirements until june we have received commitment letters and term sheets from three lenders to replace our current revolving credit agreement 
we expect to have in place by june a new credit agreement 
excess cash flows from operations are used to pay down the credit agreement 
at december   we had million of outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement and net unused borrowing availability of million 
at the company s option  the interest rate on the current revolving credit agreement is either prime rate plus or libor plus 
the weighted average interest rate for the outstanding balance at december  was 
borrowings under the current and future credit agreements and cash flows generated from operations are expected to be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for the next months 
in addition to the revolving credit agreement  the company has a term loan that expires on may  that calls for semi annual payments of million  with the balance of million due on may  the term loan is secured by  among other things  certain properties and equipment 
in the event of a sale of any of the secured properties and equipment  a portion of the net proceeds will be applied to the term loan 
at the company s option  the interest rate on the term loan is either the bank s prime rate or libor plus 
at december   the company had million outstanding under the term loan 
in the first quarter of  we redeemed the cash surrender value of certain of our life insurance policies for cash totaling approximately million 
such cash was applied directly to the term loan 
in the first quarter of  we paid the remaining balance of the term loan of million 
net cash provided by operating activities of million in  compared to million for  consisted of net income of million  adjusted for non cash items including depreciation and amortization totaling million  and changes in working capital components  primarily a decrease in accounts receivable of million  a decrease in refundable income taxes of million  an increase in inventory of million  and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of million 
the decrease in accounts receivable was related to continued improved collection techniques 
the decrease in refundable income taxes is due to the receipt in of an income tax refund  a result of the tax provisions enacted as part of the job creation and worker assistance act of in  the company incurred a net loss of million offset by non cash charges including depreciation and amortization of million  an impairment charge of million  deferred taxes of million and changes in working capital components 
net cash used in investing activities was million in compared to million during the majority of the cash used in both years was for capital expenditures 
net cash used in financing activities was million in compared to million in during  the company repaid million of short term borrowings and million of long term obligations compared to repayments of million of short term borrowings and million of long term obligations in at december  and  the company s pension plan had accumulated benefit obligations in excess of the respective plan assets and accrued pension liabilities 
this obligation in excess of plan assets and accrued liabilities resulted in an equity reduction of million at december  in  the charge to equity was reduced by million to million 
at the end of the fourth quarter of  we were in compliance with all covenants in our credit agreements 
a summary of our contractual cash obligations at december  is as follows in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total and thereafter long term debt   operating leases     total contractual cash obligations     long term debt was paid off in full in february we also have a commercial commitment as described below in thousands other commercial commitment total amount committed outstanding at date of expiration current line of credit   june critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies and estimates are summarized in the footnotes to our annual consolidated financial statements 
some of our accounting policies require management to exercise significant judgment in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
such judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
these judgments are based on our historical experience  known trends in our industry  terms of existing contracts and other information from outside sources  as appropriate 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
certain of the most critical policies that require significant judgment are as follows revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin  revenue recognition in financial statements 
revenues are recognized when all of the following criteria are met when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the selling price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenue for our product sales is recognized at the time products are shipped to customers 
revenue is recorded net of estimated discounts and returns 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we establish estimates of the uncollectibility of accounts receivable 
our management analyzes accounts receivable  historical write offs as bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts at an amount that we estimate to be sufficient to provide adequate protection against losses resulting from collecting less than full payment on receivables 
a considerable amount of judgment is required when assessing the realizability of receivables  including assessing the probability of collection and the current credit worthiness of each customer 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  an additional provision for doubtful accounts may be required 
we have not experienced significant bad debts expense and our reserve for doubtful accounts of million should be adequate for any exposure to loss in our december  accounts receivable 
product warranties 
we provide a limited warranty for the replacement of defective products 
our standard warranties require us to repair or replace defective products at no cost to the consumer 
we estimate the costs that may be incurred under our basic limited warranty and record a liability in the amount of such costs at the time product revenue is recognized 
factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of units sold  historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims  and cost per claim 
we periodically assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary 
we utilize historical trends and information received from customers to assist in determining the appropriate loss reserve levels 
we believe our warranty liability of million at december  should be adequate to cover the estimated costs we will incur in the future for warranty claims on products sold before december  pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
the determination of our obligation and expense for pension and other postretirement benefits is dependent on our selection of certain assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts 
those assumptions are described in note to the annual consolidated financial statements and include  among others  the discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore  generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods 
while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate  significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension and other postretirement obligations  our future expense and equity 
see also item a in this k for further sensitivity analysis regarding our estimated pension obligation 
allowance for slow moving inventory 
on a periodic basis  we analyze the level of inventory on hand  its cost in relation to market value and estimated customer requirements to determine whether write downs for slow moving inventory are required 
actual customer requirements in any future periods are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from estimates 
if actual or expected requirements were significantly greater or lower than the established reserves  a reduction or increase to the allowance would be recorded in the period in which such a determination was made 
we have established reserves for slow moving inventories and believe the reserve of million at december  is adequate 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets 
as a matter of policy  we review our major assets for impairment at least annually  and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
our major long lived and intangible assets are goodwill and property and equipment 
we depreciate our property and equipment over their estimated useful lives 
in connection with the adoption in of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets we determined that the goodwill associated with our safety and industrial division was impaired 
accordingly  we recorded a million charge in the first quarter of in assessing the recoverability of our remaining goodwill of million related to danner  inc subsidiary and the investments we have made in our other long term investments  primarily property and equipment of million  we have made assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded 
please refer to the forward looking statements caption below for a discussion of factors that will have an effect on our ability to attain future levels of product sales and cash flows 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin establishes standards for identifying a variable interest entity and for determining under what circumstances a variable interest entity should be consolidated with its primary beneficiary 
until now  a company generally has included another entity in its consolidated financial statements only if it controlled the entity through voting interests 
fin changes that by requiring a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or is entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
in december  the fasb published a revision to fin to clarify some of the provisions and to exempt certain entities from its requirements 
the revised provisions are applicable no later than the first reporting period ending after march  the company does not believe that the adoption of this pronouncement will have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no

in such circumstances  disclosure of the components of this liability will be included in the notes to the financial statements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary market risk results from fluctuations in interest rates 
our outstanding line of credit of million at december  is sensitive to changes in interest rates 
at our option  the line of credit interest rate is either the prime rate plus 
or the libor rate plus 
the weighted average interest rate for the outstanding balance at december  was 
we are exposed to market risk related to interest rates 
based on average floating rate borrowing of million  a one percent change in the applicable rate would have caused the company s interest expense to change by approximately million 
the company believes that these amounts are not material to the earnings of the company 
we are also exposed to market risk related to the assumptions we make in estimating our pension liability 
the assumed discount rate used  in part  to calculate the pension plan obligation is related to the prevailing long term interest rates 
at december   we used an estimated discount rate of 
a one percentage point reduction in the discount rate would result in an increase in the actuarial present value of projected pension benefits of approximately million at december  with a similar charge to equity 
furthermore  a plus or minus one percent change increase or decrease in the actual rate of return on pension plan assets would affect the additional minimum pension plan liability by approximately million
