the company has concrete tie manufacturing facilities in both spokane  wa and grand island  ne  and two facilities that design  test and fabricate rail products in atlanta  ga and niles  oh 
the rail distribution business provides our customers with access to numerous different products including stick rail  continuous welded rail  specialty trackwork  power rail and various rail accessories 
this is a highly competitive business that  once specifications are met  depends heavily on pricing 
the company maintains relationships with several rail manufacturers but procures the majority of the rail it distributes from one supplier 
rail accessories are sourced from a wide variety of suppliers 
construction products the construction segment is comprised of the following business units piling  fabricated products  precast concrete wall retention systems geotechnical division and precast concrete buildings 
the piling division  via a sales force deployed throughout the united states  markets and sells piling worldwide 
this division offers its customers various types and dimensions of structural beam piling  sheet piling  pipe piling and micropiles 
these piling products are sourced from various suppliers  however  the company has an exclusive distribution agreement with its beam and sheet piling supplier 
the fabricated products unit manufactures a number of fabricated steel and aluminum products primarily for the highway  bridge and transit industries including grid reinforced concrete deck and open steel grid flooring systems  guardrails  and expansion joints and heavy structural steel fabrications 
the concrete wall business engineers and supplies large mechanically stabilized earth retention projects mse wall and concrete soundwall systems primarily for highway construction projects 
although precasting of this product is usually outsourced to a qualified third party  the company does manufacture mse walls at its facilities in hillsboro  tx  spokane  wa and grand island  ne 

table of contents the building unit manufactures concrete buildings primarily for national parks as well as numerous state park authorities 
this unit manufactures restrooms  concession stands and other protective storage buildings available in multiple designs  textures and colors 
the company believes it is the leading high end supplier in terms of volume  product options and capabilities 
the buildings are manufactured in spokane  wa and hillsboro  tx 
tubular products the tubular segment is comprised of two discrete business units  coated pipe and threaded products 
the coated pipe unit  located in birmingham  al  coats the outer dimension and  to a lesser extent  the inner dimension of pipe primarily for the gas transmission industry 
coated pipe partners with its primary customer  a pipe manufacturer  to market a fusion bonded epoxy coating  abrasion resistant coatings and internal linings for a wide variety of pipe dimensions for pipeline projects that typically extend for several miles 
the threaded products unit  located in houston  tx  cuts  threads and paints pipe primarily for water well products for the agriculture industry and municipal water authorities 
threaded products has also entered the micro pile business and threads pipe used in earth and other structural stabilization 
developments specialty trackwork sales declined in and are expected to decline further  although less significantly in we began to terminate our relationship with a primary specialty trackwork supplier during the third quarter of in the third quarter of  we exchanged our minority ownership interest and advances to this supplier for a million promissory note from the supplier s owner  with principal and accrued interest to be repaid beginning in january the value of this note has been fully reserved and no gain or loss was recorded on this transaction 
during  and  the volume of business the supplier conducted with our company was approximately million  million and million  respectively 
most of the combined order backlog was completed in and less than million remained at year end 
if this supplier is unable to perform  it could have a further negative impact on earnings and cash flows 
in  we enjoyed an increased but still limited supply of sheet piling from our exclusive supplier 
the sheet piling supply is still not adequately consistent and reliable for our piling business to grow profitably 
we expect to be a pivotal year in determining whether sheet piling will contribute to the future growth of this business 
recent developments our agreement to supply concrete ties to a class i railroad expired in september and as a result  tie sales decreased in the second half of the year 
we are still selling ties to this customer  although there are no longer annual minimum quantity requirements 
in december  we bid on a new concrete tie supply agreement that is expected to be a to year commitment 
if our bid is successful  we will be required to establish one or more new facilities to service this agreement  which would require a significant capital investment 
if we are unsuccessful in the bidding process  it may cause the value of our two existing concrete tie facilities with total net assets of approximately million to be partially impaired 
we expect to know the results of our bid in the second quarter of our business is dependent upon steel as a key component in the products that we sell 
over the past six months  the price of scrap steel  which is a key ingredient used by mini mills to manufacture many steel products has increased by over 
this dramatic increase  caused primarily by the steep increase in demand for steel scrap in china  has recently led to market turmoil 
producers and other suppliers continue to quote rapidly escalating prices or are quoting monthly price surcharges 
some suppliers are also beginning to experience supply problems 
since many of the company s projects can be six months to twenty four months in duration  we find ourselves caught in the middle of some of these pricing and availability issues 
while management believes this highly unusual situation to be temporary in nature  it could have a negative impact on the company s sales volumes  results of operations and cash flows in 
table of contents until the market normalizes 
we are also uncertain as to what a more medium term normalization will look like with regard to pricing and availability 
the current federal highway and transportation bill tea  which was to expire on september   has been extended through april  approximately of our businesses depend on a new highway and transportation bill for future growth and profitability 
in  we began implementing lean enterprise lean across the organization 
lean is a methodology as well as a mindset  utilized in managing a business that focuses on the execution and continuous improvement of all business processes with the objective of maximizing speed and flexibility at the lowest cost 
proper implementation of lean can lead to other benefits such as better quality and improved worker safety 
lean has commenced at four of our manufacturing facilities and the preliminary results have been extremely positive  with significant improvement in productivity in several manufacturing processes 
while we have great expectations for the lean journey that we have started  it is not a panacea 
for these improvements to make a significant impact on our financial results  we must experience increased volume at these facilities 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
when more than one accounting principle  or the method of its application  is generally accepted  management selects the principle or method that is appropriate in the company s specific circumstance 
application of these accounting principles requires management to make estimates that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses  and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the following critical accounting policies relate to the company s more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
asset impairment the company is required to test for asset impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset might not be recoverable 
the company applies statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas in order to determine whether or not an asset is impaired 
this statement indicates that if the sum of the future expected cash flows associated with an asset  undiscounted and without interest charges  is less than the carrying value  an asset impairment must be recognized in the financial statements 
the amount of the impairment is the difference between the fair value of the asset and the carrying value of the asset 
the company believes that the accounting estimate related to an asset impairment is a critical accounting estimate as it is highly susceptible to change from period to period  because it requires management to make assumptions about the existence of impairment indicators and cash flows over future years 
these assumptions impact the amount of an impairment  which would have an impact on the income statement 
goodwill beginning in fiscal year  goodwill was required to be evaluated annually for impairment  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  sfas 
sfas requires a two step process be performed to analyze whether or not goodwill has been impaired 
step one is to test for potential impairment  which requires that the fair value of the reporting unit be compared to its book value 
if the fair value is higher than the book value  no impairment occurs 
if the fair value is lower than the book value  step two must be performed 
step two requires measurement of the amount of impairment loss  if any  and requires that a hypothetical purchase price allocation be done to determine the implied fair value of goodwill 
the resulting fair value is then compared to the carrying value of goodwill 
if the implied fair value of the goodwill is lower than the carrying value of the goodwill  an impairment must be recorded 
the company believes that the accounting estimate related to goodwill impairment is a critical accounting estimate because the underlying assumptions used for the discounted cash flow can change from period to 
table of contents period and these changes can cause a material impact to the income statement 
management s assumptions require significant judgment regarding discount rates  inflation rates and other internal and external economic conditions  such as expected growth rate  and anticipated future revenues 
additionally  sfas requires that the goodwill be analyzed for impairment on an annual basis using the assumptions that apply at the time the analysis is updated 
as discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  goodwill recorded in the company s rail and construction segments was analyzed for impairment with the adoption of sfas on january  the fair value of the goodwill associated with these segments was estimated using discounted cash flow methodologies and market comparable information 
based on the analysis  the implied fair value of the goodwill for certain product groups within these segments was less than the book value recorded for the goodwill 
therefore  the company recognized a pretax impairment charge of million in january  representing a write off of all goodwill for those product groups for which an impairment was determined to exist 
in the fourth quarter of and  the company performed the required annual impairment test of the carrying amount of goodwill for the product groups and concluded that no further impairment existed 
at december  and  the company maintained million of goodwill and no impairment indicators were identified 
allowance for bad debts the company s operating segments encounter risks associated with the collection of accounts receivable 
as such  the company records a monthly provision for accounts receivable that are deemed uncollectible 
in order to calculate the appropriate monthly provision  the company reviews its accounts receivable aging and calculates an allowance through application of historic reserve factors to overdue receivables 
this calculation is supplemented by specific account reviews performed by the company s credit department 
as necessary  the application of the company s allowance rates to specific customers is reviewed and adjusted to more accurately reflect the credit risk inherent within that customer relationship 
the reserve is reviewed for reasonableness on a monthly basis 
an account receivable is written off against the allowance when management determines it is uncollectible 
the company believes that the accounting estimate related to the allowance for bad debts is a critical accounting estimate because the underlying assumptions used for the allowance can change from period to period and the allowance could potentially cause a material impact to the income statement and working capital 
specific customer circumstances and general economic conditions may vary significantly from management s assumptions and may impact expected earnings 
at december  and  the company maintained an allowance for bad debts of million and million  respectively 
product liability the company maintains a current liability for the repair or replacement of defective products 
for certain manufactured products  a nominal accrual is made on a monthly basis as a percentage of cost of sales 
for long term construction projects  a liability is established when the claim is known and quantifiable 
the company believes that this is a critical accounting estimate because the underlying assumptions used to calculate the liability can change from period to period 
at december  and  the product liability was million and million  respectively 
revenue recognition on long term contracts revenues from long term contracts are recognized using the percentage of completion method based upon the proportion of actual costs incurred to estimated total costs 
for certain products  the percentage of completion is based upon the ratio of actual labor and engineering costs to estimated total labor and engineering costs 
as certain contracts extend over one or more years  revisions to estimates of costs and profits are reflected in the accounting period in which the facts that require the revisions become known 
historically  the company s estimates of total costs and costs to complete have reasonably approximated actual costs incurred to complete contracts 
at the time a loss on a contract becomes known  the entire amount of the estimated loss is recognized in the financial statements 
the company estimates the extent of progress towards completion  contract revenues and contract costs on its long term contracts 
the company believes these estimates are critical accounting estimates because they require the use of judgments due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation process 
as a result  actual revenues and profits could differ materially from estimates 

table of contents pension plans the calculation of the company s net periodic benefit cost pension expense and benefit obligation pension liability associated with its defined benefit pension plans pension plans requires the use of a number of assumptions that the company deems to be critical accounting estimates 
changes in these assumptions can result in a different pension expense and liability amounts  and future actual experience can differ significantly from the assumptions 
the company believes that the two most critical assumptions are the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate 
the expected long term rate of return reflects the average rate of earnings expected on funds invested or to be invested in the pension plans to provide for the benefits included in the pension liability 
the company establishes the expected long term rate of return at the beginning of each fiscal year based upon information available to the company at that time  including the plan s investment mix and the forecasted rates of return on these types of securities 
any differences between actual experience and assumed experience are deferred as an unrecognized actuarial gain or loss 
the unrecognized actuarial gains or losses are amortized in accordance with statement no 
although the long term rate is intended to be fairly consistent  the company reevaluated and reduced the rate in pension expense increases as the expected long term rate of return decreases 
the expected long term rate of return determined by the company for and was 
the assumed discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension benefits could effectively be settled 
in estimating that rate  statement no 
requires that the company looks to rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments 
the company s pension liability increases as the discount rate is reduced 
therefore  the decline in the assumed discount rate has the effect of increasing the company s pension obligation and future pension expense 
the assumed discount rate used by the company was and for and  respectively 
deferred tax assets the recognition of deferred tax assets requires management to make judgments regarding the future realization of these assets 
as prescribed by statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  valuation allowances must be provided for those deferred tax assets for which it is more likely than not a likelihood more than that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
sfas requires management to evaluate positive and negative evidence regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets 
determination of whether the positive evidence outweighs the negative and quantification of the valuation allowance requires management to make estimates and judgments of future financial results 
the company believes that these estimates and judgments are critical accounting estimates 
the company s financial results in recent periods had generated operating loss carryforwards  particularly with regard to the company s discontinued foreign operation  foster technologies 
the company believed that it was more likely than not that it would not be able to utilize the tax asset created by these losses and had provided a valuation allowance against this asset 
as a result of the sale of the assets and liquidation of this operation during  the company was able to recognize this tax benefit and released the million valuation allowance that it had placed against this asset 
at december   the company maintained net operating loss carryforwards and a valuation allowance of million and million  respectively 
also during  the company formally disposed of its investment in a trackwork supplier  resulting in capital loss 
due to the uncertainty of the company s ability to generate capital gains to utilize the entire loss  the company increased the valuation allowance related to this asset in from million to million 
see note  income taxes 
the company s ability to realize these tax benefits may affect the company s reported income tax expense benefit and net income loss
