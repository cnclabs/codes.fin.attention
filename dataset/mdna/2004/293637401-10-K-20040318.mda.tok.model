we have continued to enhance our management team during fiscal year  including the addition of our president  mark aslett  in april mr 
aslett joined us from marconi plc  where he held positions as the executive vice president of marketing  and earlier in his tenure at marconi  as the president of marconi communications north america 
also in april  we appointed leon k

in march  we appointed michael rivers as our executive vice president of worldwide sales and service 
mr 
rivers has over years of executive leadership experience with global enterprise networking companies 
as part of our sales and marketing improvement program  we have developed a market differentiation strategy based on our secure networks solutions  established new sales partnerships  and enhanced sales tools designed to improve sales execution 
our secure networks solutions embed security pervasively into the network infrastructure itself in order to provide protection against internal and external security threats 
we began a marketing and advertising campaign during the first quarter of fiscal year which emphasizes our secure networks solutions 
since the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we have formed new sales partnerships with ibm and saic  formed a new distributor relationship with westcon  and during the first quarter of fiscal year  we initiated a new partnership with lucent technologies which is aimed at broadening our market reach through the lucent professional services organization 
in an effort to improve internal sales execution we have developed a historical customer database designed to improve our coverage of customer accounts  and implemented new sales tools including a sales opportunity management system and e commerce tools with our partners 
we have also implemented a number of cost reduction initiatives designed to improve gross margins and reduce fixed operating costs in the past two fiscal years 
since the beginning of fiscal year  we have reduced our headcount by approximately  resulting in cumulative annualized labor cost reductions of approximately million 
during the same time period  we have closed or reduced the size of eleven facilities 
the workforce reductions during fiscal year were the result of an evaluation of our workforce and skill levels necessary to satisfy the expected future requirements of the business 
we have recorded restructuring charges of million in fiscal year  which included million in employee severance related costs for approximately individuals  plus million in facility exit costs 
table of contents primarily as a result of consolidation of our north american distribution center into an owned facility with excess space 
net of new hires  we expect to decrease our workforce of  employees at january  by approximately employees  once all the planned actions are completed 
the fiscal year reductions in the global workforce involved most functions within the company 
since fiscal year  we have incurred losses from our operations 
we incurred a net loss from operations of million for fiscal year  down from million in fiscal year and million for transition year the decrease in the net loss from operations is due to improved gross margins and decreased operating costs 
gross margin percentage improved to for fiscal year  as compared to for fiscal year and for transition year the improvement in gross margin is primarily a result of decreases in charges for excess and obsolete inventory  lower overhead costs for supply chain management due to cost reduction initiatives  and higher margins on new products 
operating expenses decreased to million for fiscal year  as compared to million in fiscal year and million in transition year the reduction in operating expenses is primarily a result of implementing various cost reduction initiatives  lower costs associated with the sec investigation and our internal investigation into our financial accounting and reporting practices  along with lower special charges for severance  facility exit costs  entity spin off costs and asset impairments 
improved gross margins and lower operating expenses  as well as the receipt of net tax refunds of million and net insurance recoveries of million from our shareholder litigation settlement enabled us to achieve positive cash flow provided by operations of million for fiscal year net revenues decreased in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year the decline in net revenues is due to a decrease in product revenue primarily due to lower sales of certain routing products for which we are in the process of developing a replacement  and increased competition for certain lower technology based switching products 
in addition  service revenue declined primarily due to the expiration of maintenance contracts on discontinued products 
these decreases were partially offset by increased sales of our new switching products 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we finalized our agreements to settle the outstanding shareholder litigation against us  and certain of our former directors and officers filed in connection with the financial restatements for the fiscal and transition years 
under the financial terms of the settlements  we agreed to pay million in cash and to distribute  shares of our stock with a settlement date value of million 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we paid million of our cash obligation  and distributed  shares of our stock 
we paid the remaining cash obligation of million in january  and we expect to distribute the remaining stock obligation of  shares of our stock during fiscal year the million total cost of the settlements was partially offset by the receipt of approximately million in cash proceeds from certain of our insurers during the fourth quarter of fiscal year we recorded a net litigation charge of million during the third quarter of fiscal year to reflect the net result of the settlements 
we are currently engaged in legal proceedings against certain other insurers to recover a portion of the remaining expenses incurred by us in connection with the shareholder litigation and other related matters 

table of contents results of operations the table below sets forth the principal line items from our consolidated statements of operations  each expressed as percentages of net revenue for the three years ended january  fiscal year fiscal year transition year net revenue product services total revenue cost of revenue product services total cost of revenue gross margin product gross margin services gross margin total gross margin research and development selling  general and administrative amortization of intangible assets stock based compensation shareholder litigation expense special charges impairment of intangible assets total operating expenses loss from operations comparison of fiscal year with fiscal year net revenue net revenue decreased by million  or  from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year  primarily due to lower unit sales volume  as well as lower revenue from maintenance contracts 
geographically  net revenue decreased in fiscal year compared to fiscal year in all regions except for asia pacific  which increased million or  primarily due to growth in china 
net revenue to customers in north america decreased by million  or  net revenue to customers in europe  the middle east and africa decreased by million  or  and  net revenue to customers in latin america decreased by million  or 
product revenue decreased by million  or  from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year the decline in net product revenue is primarily a result of lower sales of our x pedition routing products  and increased competition for our lower technology switching products  such as our vertical herizon and matrix v switching products 
these decreases in product revenue have been partially offset by increased sales of our new matrix n series modular switching products which accounted for approximately of product shipments during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  as well as increased sales of our new stand alone matrix e switch 
we are continuing to upgrade our portfolio of products to improve our competitive position including the anticipated introduction of next generation core routing technologies at or near the end of fiscal year we have also implemented a 
table of contents number of sales and marketing initiatives aimed at improving our market share  including the formation of new relationships with distributors and resellers  the implementation of new sales tools to improve sales execution  and the initiation of a new marketing and advertising campaign in fiscal year services revenue decreased by million  or  from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year the decrease in services revenue is primarily due to a declining maintenance revenue base resulting from the expiration of higher priced maintenance contracts on discontinued products  which in some cases have been replaced by lower priced contracts for new products 
sales of new product maintenance contracts were not sufficient to offset the decline in our maintenance revenue base 
for the first quarter of fiscal year  we expect services revenue to decline million to million from the previous quarter to approximately million to million 
we believe that services revenue will remain weak in fiscal year until growth in new product sales and associated maintenance contracts are sufficient to replace the expiration of higher priced maintenance contracts on discontinued products 
we expect the market for enterprise networking equipment to remain relatively flat in the near term  which may result in increased competition 
increased competition could negatively impact product revenue  and combined with the expected decline in net services revenue  could result in a reduction in total net revenues in the near term 
gross margin although net revenues decreased by  total gross margin as a percentage of net revenue increased to in fiscal year  as compared to in fiscal year this increase is primarily the result of improved product gross margin 
product gross margin increased to in fiscal year compared to in fiscal year the product gross margin percentage improvement was primarily due to a reduction of million in charges for excess and obsolete inventory  which increased gross margin by  as well as initiatives designed to lower supply costs from our contract manufacturers  and higher margins on new products 
our product gross margin percentage varies depending on unit volumes and product mix sold as well as other factors such as competitors pricing 
in addition  the nature and timing of our new product introductions  as well as our competitors new products entering the markets we serve  could adversely affect our inventory levels in the future and may result in additional excess and obsolete inventory provisions 
since our new products generally have higher margins than the products they replace  we believe that an increasing proportion of new product sales should result in fiscal year product gross margins higher than those attained for fiscal year services gross margin percentage decreased from in fiscal year to in fiscal year  primarily due to a decrease of in net services revenue and charges for the write down of service spares inventory to net realizable value 
these decreases to services gross margin were partially offset by million in reduced labor costs due to workforce reductions 
increased sales of newer products  as well as recent and anticipated expirations of legacy maintenance contracts  resulted in an excess of certain service parts during fiscal year based on the revised usage estimates  service spares inventory was written down by million to net realizable value 
we expect that services gross margin percentage will not increase much above until the growth in new product sales and associated maintenance contracts are sufficient to replace the expiration of legacy maintenance contracts 
operating expenses research and development expense decreased by million from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year  primarily due to decreases in facility costs due to certain facility closures  and decreased depreciation expense as certain assets became fully depreciated 
these decreases in research and development expenses were partially offset by increased labor costs related primarily to development of our next generation core routing platform 
fourth quarter fiscal year research and development expense was million 
we expect quarterly research and development expense for the first half of 
table of contents fiscal year to increase to approximately million to million as we invest in additional enhancements to our portfolio of products 
once these additional investments are complete  we expect quarterly research and development expenses to fall below million by the fourth quarter of fiscal year selling  general and administrative  or sg a  expense decreased by million from million in fiscal year  to million in fiscal year the decrease in sg a expense was primarily the result of a million decrease in costs  including related audit fees  associated with the settled sec investigation  our internal investigation and the various pending shareholder lawsuits discussed in this annual report  a decrease of million in labor related costs associated with workforce reductions  a million decrease in provisions for bad debts primarily due to recoveries of million in fiscal year  a million decrease in provisions for customer lease guarantees primarily due to recoveries of million in fiscal year  and a million decrease in facility costs as a result of facility consolidations 
fourth quarter fiscal year sg a expenses were million and included approximately million of recoveries primarily related to bad debt and insurance claims 
we expect that the amount of recoveries related to bad debt and insurance claims will decline significantly in fiscal year compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal year in connection with our brand awareness campaign  we expect to increase marketing and advertising expenses by approximately million to million in fiscal year as compared to the prior year 
amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangibles decreased by million from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year  primarily as a result of certain patents and technology related intangibles becoming fully amortized 
we expect the amortization of intangible assets for fiscal year to remain approximately at the fiscal year amount 
stock based compensation stock based compensation decreased by million from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year as a result of the underlying stock options  granted in connection with acquisitions in prior years  becoming fully vested 
we do not expect to incur charges for stock based compensation for fiscal year shareholder litigation expense during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we finalized our agreements to settle the outstanding shareholder litigation against us  and certain of our directors and former officers filed in connection with the financial restatements for the fiscal and transition years 
under the financial terms of the settlements  we agreed to pay million in cash and to distribute  shares of our stock with a settlement date value of million 
the million total cost of the settlement was partially offset by the receipt of approximately million in cash proceeds from certain of our insurers during the fourth quarter of fiscal year we recorded a net litigation charge of million during the third quarter of fiscal year to reflect the net result of the settlements 
special charges we recorded restructuring charges of million during fiscal year  which included million in employee severance related costs for approximately individuals and million of facility exit costs primarily as a result of consolidation of our north american distribution center into an owned facility with excess space and a decrease in estimated future sublease income anticipated from a vacated facility 
the fiscal year workforce reductions involved most functions within the business 
during fiscal year  we recorded special charges of million related to restructuring costs  which included exit costs of million related to the closure or reduction in size of ten facilities and million for employee severance costs 

table of contents interest income  net interest income  net declined from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year  primarily due to lower average cash and investment balances available for investing 
other expense  net other expense  net decreased to million for fiscal year as compared to million for fiscal year  primarily due to a million loss incurred on the riverstone stock derivative in fiscal year the riverstone stock derivative was related to our convertible preferred stock redemption liability  which was redeemed during the first quarter of fiscal year other expense  net consisted primarily of investment impairments of million for fiscal year as compared to million of investment impairments for fiscal year the investment impairments are primarily related to our legacy investments in non marketable equity securities of privately held technology companies and value added resellers  many of which are in the start up or development stage 
investments in these companies are inherently risky  which could lead to additional impairment charges in fiscal year at january   these investments on the consolidated balance sheet totaled approximately million  as compared to million as of december  income tax expense benefit for fiscal year  we did not record an income tax benefit for losses generated in the us due to the uncertainty of realizing such benefits and the fact that we have fully utilized our tax loss carryback benefits 
during fiscal year  we incurred net tax expense of million associated with certain foreign and state taxes 
for fiscal year  we recorded an income tax benefit of million primarily due to the utilization of tax loss carryback benefits associated with the passage of the job creation and worker assistance act of which changed the allowable period to carry back net operating losses from two to five years 
loss from discontinued operations during fiscal year  we recorded an additional charge of million due to a change in estimate of the loss on disposal of our wholly owned subsidiary aprisma  which was sold in august of the original provision of million for the loss on the disposal of aprisma was recorded in transition year comparison of fiscal year with transition year net revenue net revenue increased by million  or  from million in transition year to million for fiscal year  primarily because transition year included only ten months of operations compared with twelve months in fiscal year as a result of the change in our fiscal year end 
fiscal year revenue also benefited from four quarterly sales cycles  compared with only three quarterly sales cycles in transition year  since our product revenue is significantly higher in the last month of a quarterly sales cycle 
additionally  during the third quarter of transition year  we determined that we could no longer estimate the amount of future product returns from certain stocking distributors located in the united states and europe and recorded a revenue adjustment of approximately million related to inventory on hand at these distributors that had previously been recorded as revenue based on shipments to them 
this revenue adjustment was approximately of net product revenue for the second quarter of transition year since that time  we have recognized revenue from these distributors when they ship our product to their customers 
product revenue increased by million  or  from million in transition year to million in fiscal year primarily due to the million revenue adjustment for the change in revenue recognition method for distributors as noted above 
services revenue increased by million  or 
table of contents from million in transition year to million in fiscal year the slight increase was due to the shorter fiscal period in the prior ten month transition year offsetting lower fiscal year maintenance revenue renewal rates related to our discontinued products 
gross margin total gross margin as a percentage of net revenue was in fiscal year  compared with in transition year the margin percentage improvement was principally due to product gross margin  which increased to compared to a negative gross margin of in transition year the product gross margin percentage improvement was primarily due to the lower provision for excess and obsolete inventory in fiscal year in transition year  we recorded a million provision for excess and obsolete inventory  principally as a result of lower sales volume than forecast 
fiscal year excess and obsolete charges of million related principally to a reserve for the carrying value of inventory held by certain cash basis partners in asia pacific where we concluded that neither payment nor return of the inventory held by them was probable  and increased reserves for customer evaluation inventories as well as increased reserves for certain excess raw materials 
the fiscal year provision negatively impacted product margin by percentage points compared with percentage points in transition year other contributing factors to the product margin improvement included increased product revenue  and lower supply chain overhead costs resulting from headcount reductions and process improvement initiatives 
services margin percentage improved slightly from in transition year to in fiscal year  primarily due to higher service revenues in fiscal year and workforce reduction initiatives designed to lower fixed service operating costs 
operating expenses research and development expense increased by million from million in transition year to million in fiscal year  due to the fact that transition year included only ten months of operations compared with twelve months in fiscal year based on average monthly spending during transition year  annualized research and development expense for transition year would have been slightly higher than fiscal year cost reduction initiatives implemented during fiscal year  which included workforce reductions and facilities closings  decreased research and development expense in fiscal year as compared to transition year selling  general and administrative  or sg a  expense decreased by million from million in transition year to million in fiscal year despite the fact that transition year includes only ten months of operations compared with twelve months in fiscal year the decrease is primarily due to a decrease of million in provisions for bad debt and lease guarantees  a million decrease in marketing and advertising expenses  other cost reductions for various workforce reductions and reduced rent and overhead associated with the closure of various sales offices  and the dissolution of a former holding company and the related costs of that entity as part of the spin off events which took place during transition year during fiscal year we ceased guaranteeing equipment leases for our customers 
the decreases in sg a expenses were partially offset by million in costs incurred in fiscal year associated with the sec investigation and our internal investigation into our financial accounting and reporting practices  the subsequent restatement of our fiscal year and transition year financial statements  and the various shareholder lawsuits discussed in this annual report 
amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangibles decreased by million from million in transition year to million in fiscal year  primarily because we discontinued amortizing goodwill as of the beginning of fiscal year in conjunction with our adopting sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 

table of contents stock based compensation stock based compensation related to stock options issued in connection with fiscal year acquisitions of network security wizards and indus river networks was million in fiscal year and million in transition year special charges special charges decreased from million in transition year to million in fiscal year during fiscal year  we recorded special charges of million which included exit costs of million related to the closure or reduction in size of ten facilities and million for employee severance costs 
special charges incurred during transition year included million of costs related to the spin off of riverstone and million of restructuring costs 
the transition year restructuring costs included a write down of million for a vacant office building in rochester  new hampshire  to its estimated fair value  facility exit costs of million and severance costs of million 
impairment of intangible assets impairment of intangible assets in transition year reflected a fourth quarter charge of million relating to goodwill recorded in connection with our acquisition of indus river networks 
the impairment was primarily due to the complex  proprietary nature of the indus river vpn technology  which had to be substantially redesigned in order to conform with emerging industry standards  the introduction of new  low cost vpn products and technologies by a leading provider of network security products who captured a market leadership position during transition year  and abandonment of our development efforts in conjunction with a significant reduction in the acquired workforce during transition year interest income  net interest income  net declined from million in transition year to million in the fiscal year  due to lower average cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balances and lower interest rates 
other expense  net other expense  net increased to million in fiscal as compared to other expense  net of million in transition year  primarily due to a million loss incurred on the riverstone stock derivative in fiscal year compared to a gain of million in transition year the increase in the loss on the riverstone stock derivative was offset by a decrease in investment impairments to million for fiscal year compared to million in transition year in addition  during transition year  we entered into a number of transactions in which we made an investment in a customer in exchange for cash and or our products and services 
in certain of these transactions we recorded the difference between the cost of the consideration given and the fair value of the investment received as other expense 
these transactions resulted in losses of million for the transition year lastly  during transition year  we sold million shares of efficient networks  inc  or efficient  common stock  which we received in connection with the sale of our flowpoint  inc subsidiary during fiscal year  and tendered our remaining million shares for proceeds of million in connection with a tender offer to acquire the outstanding shares of efficient common stock made by siemens ag in connection with these transactions  we recognized the remaining deferred gain of million during the transition year income tax expense benefit for fiscal year  we recorded an income tax benefit of million primarily due to the utilization of tax loss carryback benefits associated with the passage of the job creation and worker assistance act of which changed the allowable period to carry back net operating losses from two to 
table of contents five years 
for the transition year  we incurred income tax expense of million due primarily to the increase in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance of million  partially offset by a reduction in current tax liabilities of million 
in addition  we did not record any income tax benefit relating to losses incurred in the period because expected income from operations and gains did not materialize in transition year loss from discontinued operations during fiscal year  we recorded a charge of million due to a change in estimate of the loss on disposal of aprisma 
during transition year  we recorded a loss from discontinued operations of million that consisted of million of operating losses from discontinued operations of our wholly owned subsidiaries  aprisma  riverstone  and gnts and provision for losses on disposal of gnts and aprisma of million and million  respectively 
cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle during the first quarter of transition year  we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and recorded a transition adjustment  which resulted in an after tax increase in net income of million related to our written call options on efficient common stock held as of march  this transition adjustment is reflected in our results of operations for transition year as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
business acquisitions and dispositions in july  we distributed our shares of riverstone common stock to our shareholders and recorded a non cash charge to retained earnings of approximately million  which reflected the distribution of the net value of the riverstone shares to our shareholders 
in july  the operations of our gnts subsidiary were discontinued through the acquisition of a small portion of gnts by a third party 
the remaining results were either absorbed by us or our aprisma subsidiary or discontinued 
in august  we sold aprisma to a third party 
as a result  we have presented aprisma as a discontinued operation for all periods presented and gnts and riverstone as discontinued operations for transition year liquidity and capital resources the sections below discuss the commitments on our liquidity and capital resources  and the effects of changes in our balance sheet and cash flows 
commitments the following is a summary of our significant contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments as of january  less than over contractual cash obligations total year years years years in millions non cancelable lease obligations non cancelable purchase commitments total contractual cash obligations 
table of contents less than over other commercial commitments total year years years years in millions aprisma lease payment guarantees venture capital commitments n a n a total commercial commitments the aprisma lease guarantee reduces to million in  million in  million in and terminates in we are indemnified for up to million in losses 
we are committed to make up to million of additional capital contributions among two venture capital funds in which we are already an investor 
in the event of future capital calls  we could be required to fund some or all of this commitment 
if we fail to make a required contribution  then our existing investments with a carrying value of million at january  would be significantly diluted 
based on recent communications from these funds  we expect approximately million to million of the remaining commitment could be called by the funds during fiscal year we cannot predict the likelihood or timing of capital calls for the remaining commitment 
accrued severance costs of million as of january  will be paid out during fiscal year  and the remaining accrued exit costs of million  which consisted of long term lease commitments  will be paid as follows million in fiscal year  million in fiscal year  million in fiscal year  million in fiscal year  and million thereafter 
our certificate of incorporation provides that we will indemnify and advance expenses to our directors and officers to the maximum extent permitted by delaware law 
accordingly  we are obligated to indemnify our former directors and officers named as defendants in the shareholder litigation  which is described in this annual report on form k under part  item  legal proceedings 
although we have director and officer liability insurance  our insurance for the period during which events related to the shareholder litigation are alleged to have occurred provides us with only limited liability protection 
we are unable to estimate our future indemnification obligations or predict whether our director and officer liability insurance will cover these obligations in whole or in part 
balance sheet and cash flows as of january   our liquid investments totaled million  as compared to million at december   and consisted of million of cash and cash equivalents  million of marketable securities and million of long term marketable securities 
in connection with the issuance of letters of credit by several banking institutions  we have agreed to maintain specified amounts of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities in collateral accounts controlled by those institutions 
these assets totaled million at january   and are classified as restricted cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities on our balance sheet 
the decrease in liquid investments during fiscal year is the result of the redemption of the series d e preferred stock  and the loss from operations  which were partially offset by the receipt of income tax refunds  and insurance proceeds 
based on our liquid investment position at january   we believe that we have sufficient liquid investments to fund our on going operations and future obligations for at least the next twelve months 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended january  and was positively impacted by the receipt of million in net income tax refunds  and million in insurance proceeds received  net of settlement costs  in connection with the shareholder litigation settlement 
we do not expect any significant tax refunds in the near future 
cash provided by operations was negatively impacted by million in payments related to severance and facility exit costs 
cash payments relating to severance and facility exit initiatives implemented to date are expected to be approximately million for fiscal year we are currently engaged in legal proceedings against certain other insurers to recover a portion of the remaining expenses incurred by us in connection with the shareholder litigation and other related matters 
we are also engaged in proceedings against our former 
table of contents subsidiary  riverstone networks  to recover approximately million based on indemnity claims related to their obligations to us 
there can be no assurance as to the timing or ultimate outcome of these matters 
net cash from operating activities is expected to be negative in the first half of fiscal year the expected negative operating cash flow is due in part to the timing of trade accounts payable obligations as well as certain payments for accrued expenses and other liabilities  including accruals for compensation and benefits  legal and litigation costs  restructuring charges  and sales and vat expense 
capital expenditures for the fiscal year were million and consisted of internal information technology purchases and upgrades  including the cost to implement our enterprise resource planning system  or erp system  in our asia pacific and emea regions  assets purchased to support outsourcing contracts  equipment and software used in research and development activities  as well as equipment and certain fixed assets and intellectual property purchased from tenor networks 
we expect capital spending of approximately million to million for fiscal year on february   the holders of our series d and e preferred stock notified us of their intention to exercise their right to redeem these shares effective as of february  we redeemed all outstanding shares of our series d and e preferred stock during the first quarter of fiscal year for million  which is net of the value of the riverstone shares sold by the holders of these shares which partially offset our redemption liability 
accounts receivable  net of allowance for doubtful accounts  were million at january  compared with million at december  the decrease in accounts receivable is due primarily to the decline in net revenue 
the number of days sales outstanding was days at january   compared to days at december  the increase in the number of days sales outstanding is primarily due to the increase in the percentage of sales outside of north america  to customers with longer payment terms and the conversion of one of our larger distributors in asia pacific from revenue recognition upon cash receipt to revenue recognition when the distributor ships our products to their customers 
inventories were million at january  or turns per annum  compared with million at december  or turns per annum 
inventories have decreased during fiscal year primarily as a result of million in inventory write downs  and a million reduction in channel inventories due to improved channel inventory management 
we expect future cash commitments related to inventory purchases to vary based on sales order demand 
in addition  the nature and timing of our new product introductions as well as our competitors new products entering the markets we serve could have an adverse affect on our inventory levels in the future and may result in additional excess and obsolete inventory provisions 
accounts payable at january  of million declined from million at december  due in part to decreased expenses for professional fees and the timing of payments related to product purchases 
application of critical accounting estimates our significant accounting policies are described in the consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we base our estimates on historical experience  current conditions and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the markets for our products are characterized by rapid technological development  intense competition and frequent new product introductions  any of which could affect the future realizability of our assets 
estimates and 
table of contents assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and the effects of revisions are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period they are determined to be necessary 
actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies impact our judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue on arrangements where products and services were bundled in accordance with eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
in accordance with eitf  we determine whether the deliverables are separable into multiple units of accounting 
we allocate the total fee on such arrangements to the individual deliverables based on their relative fair values or using the residual method 
the application of eitf includes judgments as to whether the delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis and whether we have established objective and reliable evidence of fair value for the undelivered items 
our ability to recognize revenue in the future may be affected if actual selling prices are significantly less than the fair values 
we recognize revenue on arrangements where software and services were bundled in accordance with sop software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  modification of sop  software recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
we allocate the total fee on such arrangements based on the fair values of each element or using the residual method 
our ability to recognize revenue in the future may be affected if actual selling prices are significantly less than the fair values 
allowance for doubtful accounts and notes receivable 
we estimate the collectibility of our accounts receivable and notes receivable and the related amount of bad debts that may be incurred in the future 
the allowance for doubtful accounts results from an analysis of specific customer accounts  historical experience  customer concentrations  credit ratings and current economic trends 
based on this analysis  we provide allowances for specific accounts where collectibility is not reasonably assured 
in addition  we provide a full allowance for any customer balances that are greater than days past due 
the allowance for notes receivable is based on specific customer accounts 
provision for inventory valuation 
inventory purchases and commitments are based upon future demand forecasts 
reserves for excess and obsolete inventory are established to account for the potential differences between our forecasted demand and the amount of purchased and committed inventory 
we periodically experience variances between the amount of inventory purchased and contractually committed to and our demand forecasts  resulting in excess and obsolete inventory charges 
in addition  we periodically adjust service spares inventory to net realizable value  as well as reserve for service parts in excess of usage estimates 
at january   our provision for inventory valuation was million 
valuation of goodwill 
goodwill is the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in business combinations 
in accordance with financial accounting standards board  or fasb  statement of financial standards  or sfas  no 
 goodwill is subject to an annual impairment test using a fair value based approach 
in assessing the fair value of goodwill  we make projections regarding future cash flow and other estimates 
if these projections or other estimates change in the future  we may be required to record an impairment charge 
at january   the carrying value of goodwill on our balance sheet was million 
based on our annual impairment test  we did not record an impairment charge during fiscal year valuation of long lived assets 
long lived assets are comprised of property  plant and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives 
we assess the impairment of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable through projected undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangible assets and fixed assets may not be recoverable  we measure impairment by the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds the related fair value 
estimated fair value is generally based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in the business underlying the asset in question 
at january   the carrying value of long lived assets  including fixed assets and intangible assets  was million 
we did not incur any impairment charges relating to these assets during fiscal year 
table of contents valuation of investments 
we maintain certain minority investments in debt and equity securities of companies that were acquired for cash and in non monetary transactions whereby we exchanged inventory or product credits for preferred or common stock or convertible notes 
we review investments for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
many factors are considered in assessing potential impairments 
such events or factors include declines in the investees stock price in new rounds of financing  market capitalization relative to book value  deteriorating financial condition or results of operations and bankruptcy or insolvency 
from time to time we may engage third party experts to estimate the recoverable value of investments management may consider selling 
appropriate reductions in carrying value are recognized in other expense  net in the consolidated statements of operations 
we are currently considering selling our interests in several private venture funds  which would eliminate future capital call obligations 
at january   the carrying value of these investments on our balance sheet was million 
we incurred impairment charges of million relating to these investments during fiscal year restructuring reserves 
we have periodically recorded restructuring charges in connection with our plans to reduce the cost structure of our business 
these restructuring charges  which reflect management s commitment to a termination or exit plan that will be completed within twelve months  require management s judgment and may include severance benefits and costs for future lease commitments or excess facilities  net of estimated future sublease income 
in determining the amount of the facility exit costs  we are required to estimate such factors as future vacancy rates  the time required to sublet properties and sublease rates 
if the actual cost incurred exceeds the estimated cost  an additional charge to earnings will result 
if the actual cost is less than the estimated cost  a reduction to special charges will be recognized in the statement of operations 
during fiscal year  we incurred charges of approximately million due to a change in estimated sublease income for a vacated facility 
at january   we have estimated sublease income associated with vacated facilities of approximately million 
this estimate of sublease income is subject to change based on known real estate market conditions 
income taxes 
we estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we increase or decrease our income tax provision in our statement of operations 
if any of our estimates of our prior period taxable income or loss prove to be incorrect  material differences could impact the amount and timing of income tax benefits or payments for any period 
in addition  the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions 
we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary  the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary 
if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment  a further charge to expense would result

in november  the fasb issued eitf no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  which provides guidance on how to account for revenue arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services and or rights to use assets 
the provisions of this pronouncement were effective for revenue arrangements entered into beginning in our third quarter of fiscal year the adoption of eitf no

in january  fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  or vie s  was issued and in december  a revision of fin no 
was issued 
fin no 
requires identification of the company s participation in vie s  which are defined as entities with a level of invested equity that is not sufficient to fund future activities to permit them to operate on a stand alone basis  or whose equity holders lack certain characteristics of a controlling financial interest

sets forth a model to evaluate potential consolidation based on an assessment of which party to a vie  if any  bears a majority of the risk of the vie s expected losses  or stands to gain from a majority of the vie s expected returns 
fin no 
also sets forth certain disclosures regarding interests in vie s that are deemed significant  even if consolidation is not required

cautionary statements we may occasionally make forward looking statements and estimates such as forecasts and projections of our future performance or statements of our plans and objectives 
these forward looking statements may be contained in  among other things  sec filings  including this annual report on form k  press releases made by us  and in oral statements made by our officers 
actual results could differ materially from those contained in such forward looking statements 
important factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those contained in such forward looking statement include  among other things  the risks described below 
risks related to our financial results and condition worldwide and regional economic uncertainty  increased market competition and recent political and social turmoil may continue to negatively affect our business and revenue and continue to make forecasting more difficult our business is subject to the effects of general worldwide economic conditions  particularly in the united states and europe  the middle east and africa  and market conditions in the networking industry  which have been particularly uncertain 
recent political and social turmoil  such as terrorist and military actions  as well as the effects of hostilities involving the us in the middle east  north korea or anywhere else in the world  and any continuation or repercussions thereof or responses thereto  may put further pressure on uncertain worldwide economic conditions  particularly if they continue for an extended period of time 
if economic or market conditions remain uncertain  fail to improve or worsen  our business  revenue  and forecasting ability will continue to be negatively affected  which could harm our results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents competition in the networking industry has increased over the past two years as enterprises more closely monitor their costs and investments in response to continued economic uncertainty 
in recent quarters  our product revenue has declined as a result of increased competition and a lengthened sales cycle attributable in part to uncertain economic and market conditions as well as other factors 
continued economic uncertainty could further increase competition in our industry  reduce demand for our products and increase our risk of additional excess and obsolete inventory provisions and service spare inventory write downs  any of which could harm our revenue and reduce our gross margin 
these uncertain political  social and economic conditions and uncertainties also make it extremely difficult for us  our customers and our vendors to accurately forecast and plan future business activities 
in particular  it is difficult for us to develop and implement strategies  forecast demand for our products  and effectively manage contract manufacturing and supply chain relationships 
this reduced predictability challenges our ability to operate profitably and to grow our business 
we have a history of losses in recent years and may not operate profitably in the future we have experienced losses in recent years and may not achieve or sustain profitability in the future 
we will need to either generate higher revenue or reduce our costs to achieve and maintain consistent profitability 
we may not be able to generate higher revenue or reduce our costs  and if we do achieve profitability  we may not be able to sustain or increase our profitability over subsequent periods 
our revenue has been negatively affected by weaker economic conditions worldwide  which has increased price and technological competition for most of our products  as well as resulted in longer selling cycles 
if uncertain worldwide economic conditions continue for an extended period of time  our ability to maintain and increase our revenue may be significantly limited 
in addition  while we continue to implement cost reduction plans designed to decrease our expenses  including reductions in the size of our workforce  we will continue to have large fixed expenses and expect to continue to incur significant sales and marketing  product development  customer support and service and other expenses 
we continue to assess whether additional cost cutting efforts may be required 
additional cost cutting efforts may result in the recording of additional financial charges  such as workforce reduction costs  facilities reduction costs  asset write downs and contractual settlements 
further  our workforce reductions may impair our ability to realize our current or future business objectives 
costs incurred in connection with our cost cutting efforts may be higher than the estimated costs of such actions and may not lead to anticipated cost savings 
as a result  our cost cutting efforts may not result in a return to profitability 
our quarterly operating results are likely to fluctuate  which could cause us to fail to meet quarterly operating targets and result in a decline in our stock price our operating expenses are largely based on anticipated organizational size and revenue trends  and a high percentage of these expenses are  and will continue to be  fixed in the short term 
as a result  if our revenue for a particular quarter is below our expectations  we will be unable to proportionately reduce our operating expenses for that quarter 
any revenue shortfall in a quarter may thus cause our financial results for that quarter to fall below the expectations of public market analysts or investors  which could cause the price of our common stock to fall 
any increase in our fixed expenses will increase the magnitude of this risk 
in addition  the unpredictability of our operating results from quarter to quarter could cause our stock to trade at lower prices than it would if our results were consistent from quarter to quarter 
our quarterly operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter in the future due to a number of factors  including fluctuations in the demand for our products and services  the timing and size of sales of our products or the cancellation or rescheduling of significant orders  the length and variability of the sales cycle for our products  the timing of implementation and product acceptance by our customers and by customers of our distribution partners  
table of contents the timing and success of new product introductions  increases in the prices or decreases in the availability of the components we purchase  price and product competition in the networking industry  our ability to source and receive from third party sources appropriate product volumes and quality  our ability to execute on our operating plan and strategy  manufacturing lead times and our ability to maintain appropriate inventory levels  the timing and level of research  development and prototype expenses  the mix of products and services sold  changes in the distribution channels through which we sell our products and the loss of distribution partners  the uncertainties inherent in our accounting estimates and assumptions and the impact of changes in accounting principles  our ability to achieve targeted cost reductions  the outcome of pending securities litigation  and general economic conditions as well as those specific to the networking industry 
due to these and other factors  you should not rely on quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results as an indicator of our future performance 
we earn a substantial portion of our revenue for each quarter in the last month of each quarter  which reduces our ability to accurately forecast our quarterly results and increases the risk that we will be unable to achieve previously forecasted results we have derived and expect to continue to derive a substantial portion of our revenue in the last month of each quarter  with such revenue frequently concentrated in the last two weeks of the quarter 
because we rely on the generation of a large portion of revenue at the end of the quarter  we traditionally have not been able  and in the future do not expect to be able  to predict our financial results for any quarter until very late in the quarter 
due to this end of quarter buying pattern  we may not achieve our financial forecasts  either because expected sales do not occur in the anticipated quarter or because they occur at lower prices or on terms that are less favorable to us than anticipated 
our failure to improve and successfully implement our management information systems and internal controls could harm our business through the end of fiscal year  we used three disparate information systems in our domestic and international operations  resulting in delays in obtaining timely information on a worldwide basis and the use of manual procedures to review our consolidated financial results 
further  we have reviewed our systems controls and operating procedures and identified improvements which could be made 
pursuant to new sec rules under the sarbanes oxley act of  we are required to include in our future form k filings a report by our management as to the effectiveness of our internal controls and procedures for financial reporting 
beginning with our form k for fiscal year  our independent auditors will be required to attest to and report on the evaluation by management 
although we have implemented a number of changes designed to improve our systems and controls  including organizational changes  implementation of new business systems  communication of revenue recognition and other accounting policies to all of our employees  implementation of an internal audit function  new approval procedures and various other initiatives  including extensive supervisory and management oversight along with process improvement programs  we anticipate making additional changes to improve our systems controls and procedures  some of which may result in higher future operating expenses and capital 
table of contents expenditures 
in addition  we made significant upgrades to our management information systems during fiscal year  and plan to make continued upgrades to these systems 
the implementation of these upgrades involves significant effort and is complex 
if we are unable to successfully and or timely implement these upgrades  our business could be disrupted and our financial condition harmed 
if we fail to strengthen our management information systems and internal controls  our ability to manage our business and implement our strategies may be impaired  irregularities may occur or fail to be identified  and our financial condition could be harmed 
in addition  even if we are successful in strengthening these systems and controls  they may not sufficiently improve our ability to manage our business and implement our strategies  or be adequate to prevent or identify irregularities and ensure the effectiveness of our system of controls and procedures 
we continue to introduce new products  and if our customers delay product purchases or choose alternative solutions  our revenue could decline  we may incur excess and obsolete inventory charges  and our financial condition could be harmed we are in the process of introducing new versions of our entire product portfolio 
many of our customers may initially require additional time to evaluate our new products  extending the sales cycle  or may choose alternative solutions 
in addition  sales of our existing products could decline as customers await the release of our new products and  as a result  we could be exposed to an increased risk of inventory obsolescence 
if customers defer purchasing decisions or choose alternative solutions in connection with our new product introductions  our revenue could decline and our financial condition could be harmed 
pending and future litigation could materially harm our business  operating results and financial condition several lawsuits have been filed against us and our directors in recent years  including nine shareholder class action lawsuits filed between october  and march  see part i  item legal proceedings of this annual report for a more detailed discussion of pending litigation 
the unfavorable resolution of any specific lawsuit could materially harm our business  operating results and financial condition  and could cause the price of our common stock to decline significantly 
the uncertainty associated with these lawsuits could seriously harm our business  financial condition and reputation by  among other things  harming our relationships with existing customers and impairing our ability to attract new customers  and we may be required to pay significant damages in connection with the and securities lawsuits which remain pending 
in addition  the defense of the and lawsuits will continue to result in significant expense and the continued diversion of our management s time and attention from the operation of our business  which could impede our ability to achieve our business objectives 
although we have insurance designed to cover claims under these lawsuits  this insurance may not be adequate to cover expenses and certain liabilities relating to these lawsuits  and we may need to litigate with our insurance carriers to obtain coverage under our insurance policies 
for example  with respect to our recently settled class action litigation  although we received cash proceeds of approximately million from our insurers and have engaged in legal proceedings against other insurers to recover a portion of the remaining expenses incurred  we do not expect these proceeds will fully cover all of our costs and expenses incurred in connection with this and other related matters and we may be unsuccessful in our litigation against the other insurers 
the limitations of our director and officer liability insurance may materially harm our financial condition our director and officer liability insurance for the period during which events related to securities class action lawsuits against us and certain of our current and former officers and directors are alleged to have occurred  provides only limited liability protection 
if these policies do not adequately cover expenses and certain liabilities relating to these lawsuits  our financial condition could be materially harmed 
our 
table of contents certificate of incorporation provides that we will indemnify and advance expenses to our directors and officers to the maximum extent permitted by delaware law 
the indemnification covers any expenses and liabilities reasonably incurred by a person  by reason of the fact that such person is or was or has agreed to be a director or officer  in connection with the investigation  defense and settlement of any threatened  pending or completed action  suit  proceeding or claim 
the facts underlying the sec investigation against us  which was settled in february  and the shareholder lawsuits have increased the premiums we must pay for director and officer liability insurance  and may make this insurance coverage prohibitively expensive or unavailable in the future 
increased premiums for this insurance could materially harm our financial results in future periods 
the inability to obtain this coverage due to its unavailability or prohibitively expensive premiums would make it significantly more difficult for us to retain and attract officers and directors 
we have experienced significant turnover of senior management and our current management team has been together for only a limited time  which could harm our business and operations since august there have been numerous changes in our senior management team 
in august  our management team was restructured to include several senior executives of one of our operating subsidiaries 
then in april  we announced the departure of several of these senior executives  including our president and chief executive officer 
we appointed a new chief executive officer and a new president in april  and  in the period from march to march  we appointed a number of other senior officers  including promoting our vice president of finance to the position of chief financial officer  appointing a new executive vice president of sales  executive vice president of worldwide marketing and product management and vice president of human resources  and adding an executive vice president of supply chain management 
in december  our president resigned upon the completion of his employment agreement with us  and  in april  we appointed a new president 
in may we appointed a new executive vice president of engineering and in march we appointed a new executive vice president of worldwide sales and service 
because of these recent changes and their recent recruitment  our current management team has not worked together for a significant length of time and may not be able to work together effectively to successfully develop and implement business strategies 
in addition  as a result of these management changes  management will need to devote significant attention and resources to preserve and strengthen relationships with employees and customers 
if our new management team is unable to develop successful business strategies  achieve our business objectives  or maintain positive relationships with employees and customers  our ability to grow our business and successfully meet operational challenges could be impaired 
retaining key management and employees is critical to our success our future success depends to a significant extent on the continued services of our key employees  many of whom have significant experience with the network communications market  as well as relationships with many of our existing and potential enterprise customers and business partners 
the loss of several of our key employees or any significant portion of them could have a significant detrimental effect on our ability to execute our business strategy 
our future success also depends on our continuing ability to identify  hire  train  assimilate and retain large numbers of highly qualified engineering  sales  marketing  managerial and support personnel 
if we cannot successfully recruit and retain such persons  particularly in our engineering and sales departments  our development and introduction of new products could be delayed and our ability to compete successfully could be impaired 
despite the current economic downturn  the competition for qualified employees in our industry is particularly intense in the new england area  where our principal operations are located  and it can be difficult to attract and retain quality employees at reasonable cost 
we have from time to time experienced  and we expect to continue to experience in the future  difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications 
in addition  the significant downturn in our business environment has caused us to significantly reduce our workforce and implement other cost containment activities  including consolidating our operating locations and relocating some of our personnel to 
table of contents rochester  new hampshire and andover  massachusetts 
these actions  as well as the pending securities litigation  may lead to disruptions in our business  reduced employee morale and productivity  increased attrition and difficulty retaining existing employees and recruiting future employees  any of which could harm our business and operating results 
we maintain investments in early stage  privately held technology companies and value added resellers  and we could lose our entire investment in these companies we have made investments in privately held technology companies and value added resellers  many of which are in the start up or development stage 
investments in these companies are inherently risky as the technologies or products they have under development  or the services they propose to provide  are often in early stages of development and may never materialize 
we may never realize any benefits or financial returns from these investments  and  if these companies are not successful  we could lose our entire investment 
the concentration of our investments in a small number of related industries  primarily telecommunications  exposes our investments to increased risk  particularly if these industries continue to be adversely affected by continued worldwide economic uncertainty 
at january   these investments totaled approximately million 
during the year ended january   we recorded impairment losses of million relating to these investments 
we are exposed to the credit risk of some of our customers our payment terms are typically days in the united states  and sometimes longer internationally 
we assess the payment ability of our customers in granting such terms and maintain reserves that we believe are adequate to cover doubtful accounts  however  as a result of current economic uncertainty  our exposure to the credit risk of our customers has increased 
some of our customers are experiencing  or may experience  reduced revenue and cash flow problems  and may be unable to pay  or may delay payment for  amounts owed to us 
although we monitor the credit risk of our customers  we may not be effective in managing our exposure 
if our customers are unable to pay amounts owed to us or cancel outstanding orders  our forecasting ability  cash flow and revenue could be harmed and our business and results of operations may be adversely affected 
we may need additional capital to fund our future operations  commitments and contingencies and  if it is not available when needed  our business and financial condition may be harmed we believe our existing working capital and cash available from operations will enable us to meet our working capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 
our working capital requirements and cash flows historically have been  and are expected to continue to be  subject to quarterly and yearly fluctuations  depending on such factors as capital expenditures  sales levels  collection of receivables  inventory levels  supplier terms and obligations  and other factors impacting our financial performance and condition 
our inability to manage cash flow fluctuations resulting from these and other factors could impair our ability to fund our working capital requirements from operating cash flows and other sources of liquidity or to achieve our business objectives in a timely manner 
we have not established any borrowing relationships with financial institutions and are primarily reliant on cash generated from operations to meet our cash requirements 
if cash from future operations is insufficient  or if cash must be used for currently unanticipated uses  we may need to raise additional capital or reduce our expenses 
we cannot assure you that additional capital  if required  will be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
as a result of the current capital market environment  as well as the pending securities litigation against us  our ability to access the capital markets and establish borrowing relationships with financial institutions has been impaired and may continue to be impaired for the foreseeable future 
if we are unable to obtain additional capital when needed or must reduce our expenses  it is likely that our product development and marketing efforts will be restricted  which would harm our ability to develop new and enhanced products  expand our distribution relationships and customer base  and grow our business 
this could adversely impact our competitive position and cause our revenue to decline 
to the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities  existing stockholders may 
table of contents suffer dilution 
also  these securities may provide the holders with rights  privileges and preferences senior to those of common stockholders 
if we raise additional capital through the sale of debt securities  the terms of the debt could impose restrictions on our operations 
risks related to the markets for our products there is intense competition in the market for enterprise network equipment  which could prevent us from increasing our revenue and achieving profitability the network communications market is dominated by a small number of competitors  some of which  cisco systems in particular  have substantially greater resources and market share than other participants in that market  including us 
in addition  this market is intensely competitive  subject to rapid technological change and significantly affected by new product introductions and other market activities of industry participants 
competitive pressures could result in price reductions  reduced margins or loss of market share  which would materially harm our ability to increase revenue and profitability 
our principal competitors include alcatel  cisco systems  extreme networks  foundry networks  hewlett packard  huawei  nortel networks  and com 
we also experience competition from a number of other smaller public and private companies 
we may experience reluctance by our prospective customers to replace or expand their current infrastructure solutions  which may be supplied by one or more of these competitors  with our products 
there has also been a trend toward consolidation in our industry for several years  and we expect this trend will continue as companies attempt to strengthen or maintain their market share positions 
consolidation among our competitors and potential competitors may result in stronger competitors with expanded product offerings and a greater ability to accelerate their development of new technologies 
some of our competitors have significantly more established customer support and professional services organizations and substantially greater selling and marketing  technical  manufacturing  financial and other resources than we do 
many of our competitors also have more customers  greater market recognition and more established relationships and alliances in the industry 
as a result  these competitors may be able to develop  enhance and expand their product offerings more quickly  adapt more swiftly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer demands  devote greater resources to the marketing and sale of their products  pursue acquisitions and other opportunities more readily and adopt more aggressive pricing policies 
additional competitors with significant market presence and financial resources may enter our rapidly evolving market  thereby further intensifying competition 
we may be unable to upgrade our indirect distribution channels  which may hinder our ability to grow our customer base and increase our revenue our sales and distribution strategy relies heavily on our indirect sales efforts  including sales through distributors and channel partners  such as value added resellers  systems integrators and telecommunications service providers 
we believe that our future success will depend in part upon our ability to maintain and upgrade existing relationships  as well as establish successful new relationships  with a variety of these partners 
if we are unable to upgrade our indirect distribution channels  we may be unable to increase or sustain market awareness or sales of our products and services  which may prevent us from maintaining or increasing our customer base and revenue 
even if we are able to upgrade our indirect distribution channels  our revenue may not increase 
our distribution partners are not prohibited from selling products and services that compete with ours and may not devote adequate resources to selling our products and services 
in addition  we may be unable to maintain our existing agreements or reach new agreements with distribution partners on a timely basis or at all 

table of contents we expect the average selling prices of our products to decrease over time  which may reduce our revenue and gross margins our industry has experienced erosion of average selling prices in recent years  particularly as products reach the end of their life cycles 
we anticipate that the average selling prices of our products will decrease in the future in response to increased sales discounts and new product or technology introductions by us and our competitors 
our prices will also likely be adversely affected by downturns in regional or industry economies 
we also expect our gross margins may be adversely affected by increases in material or labor costs and an increasing reliance on third party distribution channels 
if we are unable to achieve commensurate cost reductions and increases in sales volumes  any decline in average selling prices will reduce our revenue and gross margins 
if we do not anticipate and respond to technological developments and evolving customer requirements and introduce new products in a timely manner  we may not retain our current customers or attract new customers the markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technologies and frequent new product introductions 
the introduction by us or our competitors of new products and the emergence of new industry standards and practices can render existing products obsolete and unmarketable  increasing our risk of excess and obsolete inventory charges 
our success will depend upon our ability to enhance our existing products and to develop and introduce  on a timely and cost effective basis  new products and functionality that keep pace with technological developments and emerging standards 
any failure to introduce new products and enhancements on a timely basis will harm our future revenue and prospects 
our future success will also depend upon our ability to develop and manage customer relationships and to introduce a variety of new products and product enhancements that address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers 
our current and prospective customers may require product features and capabilities that our products do not have 
we must anticipate and adapt to customer requirements and offer products that meet those demands in a timely manner 
our failure to develop products that satisfy evolving customer requirements could seriously harm our ability to achieve or maintain market acceptance for our products and prevent us from recovering our product development investments 
our focus on sales to enterprise customers subjects us to risks that may be greater than those for providers with a more diverse customer base we focus principally on sales of products and services to enterprises  such as large corporations and government agencies that rely on network communications for many important aspects of their operations 
this focus subjects us to risks that are particular to this customer segment 
for example  many of our current and potential customers are health care  education and governmental agencies  all of whom are generally slower to incorporate information technology into their business practices due to the regulatory and privacy issues that must be addressed with respect to the sharing of their information 
in addition  the use and growth of the internet is critical to enterprises  which often have electronic networks  applications and other mission critical functions that use the internet 
to the extent that there is any decline in use of the internet for electronic commerce or communications  for whatever reason  including performance  reliability or security concerns  we may experience decreased demand for our products and lower than expected revenue growth 
many of our competitors sell their products to both enterprises and service providers  which are companies who provide internet based services to businesses and individuals 
in the future  the demand for network communications products from enterprises may not grow as rapidly as the demand from service providers 
enterprises may turn to service providers to supply them with services that obviate the need for enterprises to implement many of our solutions 
because we sell our products primarily to enterprises  our exposure to these risks is greater than that of vendors that sell to a more diversified customer base 

table of contents risks related to our products our products are very complex  and undetected defects may increase our costs  harm our reputation with our customers and lead to costly litigation our network communications products are extremely complex and must operate successfully with complex products of other vendors 
our products may contain undetected errors when first introduced or as we introduce product upgrades 
the pressures we face to be the first to market new products or functionality increases the possibility that we will offer products in which we or our customers later discover problems 
we have experienced new product and product upgrade errors in the past and expect similar problems in the future 
these problems may cause us to incur significant costs to support our service contracts and other costs and divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts 
if we are unable to repair these problems in a timely manner  we may experience a loss of or delay in revenue and significant damage to our reputation and business prospects 
many of our customers rely upon our products for business critical applications 
because of this reliance  errors  defects or other performance problems in our products could result in significant financial and other damage to our customers 
our customers could attempt to recover these losses by pursuing product liability claims against us  which  even if unsuccessful  would likely be time consuming and costly to defend and could adversely affect our reputation 
if our products do not comply with complex governmental regulations and evolving industry standards  our products may not be widely accepted  which may prevent us from sustaining our revenue or achieving profitability the market for network communications equipment is characterized by the need to support industry standards as different standards emerge  evolve and achieve acceptance 
in the past  we have had to delay the introduction of new products to comply with third party standards testing 
we may be unable to address compatibility and interoperability problems that arise from technological changes and evolving industry standards 
we also may devote significant resources developing products designed to meet standards that are not widely adopted 
in the united states  our products must comply with various governmental regulations and industry regulations and standards  including those defined by the federal communications commission  underwriters laboratories and networking equipment building standards 
internationally  our products are required to comply with standards or obtain certifications established by telecommunications authorities in various countries and with recommendations of the international telecommunications union 
if we do not comply with existing or evolving industry standards  fail to anticipate correctly which standards will be widely adopted or fail to obtain timely domestic or foreign regulatory approvals or certificates  we will be unable to sell our products where these standards or regulations apply  which may prevent us from sustaining our revenue or achieving profitability 
the united states government may impose unique requirements on network equipment providers before they are permitted to sell to the government  such as that supplied products qualify as made in the united states 
such requirements may be imposed on some or all government procurements 
we may not always satisfy all such requirements 
other governments or industries may establish similar performance requirements or tests that we may be unable to satisfy 
if we are unable to satisfy the performance or other requirements of the united states government or other industries that establish them  our revenue growth may be lower than expected 
because several of our significant competitors maintain dominant positions in selling network equipment products to enterprises and others  they may have the ability to establish de facto standards within the industry 
any actions by these competitors or other industry leaders that diminish compliance by our products with industry or de facto standards or the ability of our products to interoperate with other network communication products would be damaging to our reputation and our ability to generate revenue 

table of contents we may periodically establish relationships with other companies to develop  manufacture and sell products  which could increase our reliance on others for development or supply capabilities or generation of revenue and may lead to disputes about ownership of intellectual property we may periodically establish relationships with other companies to incorporate our technology into products and solutions sold by these organizations as well as to jointly develop  manufacture and or sell new products and solutions with these organizations 
we may be unable to enter into agreements of this type on favorable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to enter into these agreements on favorable terms  or if our partners do not devote sufficient resources to developing  manufacturing and or selling the products that incorporate our technology or the new products we have jointly developed  our revenue growth could be lower than expected 
if we are able to enter into these agreements  we will likely be unable to control the amount and timing of resources our partners devote to developing products incorporating our technology or to jointly developing new products and solutions 
further  although we intend to retain all rights in our technology in these arrangements  we may be unable to negotiate the retention of these rights and disputes may arise over the ownership of technology developed as a result of these arrangements 
these and other potential disagreements between us and these organizations could lead to delays in the research  development or sale of products we are jointly developing or more serious disputes  which may be costly to resolve 
disputes with organizations that also serve as indirect distribution channels for our products could also reduce our revenue from sales of our products 
our limited ability to protect our intellectual property may hinder our ability to compete we regard our products and technology as proprietary 
we attempt to protect them through a combination of patents  copyrights  trademarks  trade secret laws  contractual restrictions on disclosure and other methods 
these methods may not be sufficient to protect our proprietary rights 
we also generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees  consultants and customers  and generally control access to and distribution of our documentation and other proprietary information 
despite these precautions  it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise misappropriate and use our products or technology without authorization  particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states  or to develop similar technology independently 
we have resorted to litigation in the past and may need to resort to litigation in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others 
litigation of this type could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could harm our business 
we may be subject to claims that our intellectual property infringes upon the proprietary rights of others  and a successful claim could harm our ability to sell and develop our products we license technology from third parties and are continuing to develop and acquire additional intellectual property 
although we have not been involved in any material litigation relating to our intellectual property  we expect that participants in our markets will be increasingly subject to infringement claims 
third parties may try to claim our products infringe their intellectual property  in which case we would be forced to defend ourselves or our customers  manufacturers and suppliers against those claims 
any claim  whether meritorious or not  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation and or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
although we carry general liability insurance  our insurance may not cover potential claims of this type or may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that may be imposed 
in addition  any royalty or licensing agreements might not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all  in which case we would have to cease selling  incorporating or using the products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property and expend substantial amounts of resources to redesign our products 
if we are forced to enter into unacceptable royalty or licensing agreements or to redesign our products  our business and prospects would suffer 

table of contents risks related to our manufacturing and components we use several key components for our products that we purchase from single or limited sources  and we could lose sales if these sources fail to fulfill our needs we currently work with third parties to manufacture our key proprietary application specific integrated circuits  which are custom designed circuits built to perform a specific function more rapidly than a general purpose microprocessor 
these proprietary circuits are very complex  and these third parties are our sole source suppliers for the specific types of application specific integrated circuits that they supply to us 
we also have limited sources for semiconductor chips that we use in some of our products  as well as several other key components used in the manufacture of our products 
we do not carry significant inventories of these components  and we do not have a long term  fixed price or minimum volume agreements with these suppliers 
if we encounter future problems with these vendors  we likely would not be able to develop an alternate source in a timely manner 
we have encountered shortages and delays in obtaining these components in the past and may experience similar shortages and delays in the future 
if we are unable to purchase our critical components  particularly our application specific integrated circuits  at such times and in such volumes as our business requires  we may not be able to deliver our products to our customers in accordance with schedule requirements 
in addition  any delay in obtaining key components for new products under development could cause a significant delay in the initial launch of these products 
any delay in the launch of new products could harm our reputation and operating results 
even if we are able to obtain these components in sufficient volumes and on schedules that permit us to satisfy our delivery requirements  we have little control over their cost 
accordingly  the lack of alternative sources for these components may force us to pay higher prices for them 
if we are unable to obtain these components from our current suppliers or others at economical prices  our margins could be adversely impacted unless we raise the prices of our products in a commensurate manner 
the existing competitive conditions may not permit us to do so  in which case our operating results may suffer 
we depend upon a limited number of contract manufacturers for substantially all of our manufacturing requirements  and the loss of either of our primary contract manufacturers would impair our ability to meet the demands of our customers we do not have internal manufacturing capabilities 
we outsource most of our manufacturing to two companies  flextronics international  ltd 
and accton technology corporation  which procure material on our behalf and provide comprehensive manufacturing services  including assembly  test  control and shipment to our customers 
our agreement with flextronics expired in february and  since that time  we have been operating under an informal extension of the expired contract while negotiating a new agreement with flextronics 
if we experience increased demand for our products  we will need to increase our manufacturing capacity with flextronics and accton or add additional contract manufacturers 
flextronics and accton also build products for other companies  and we cannot be certain that they will always have sufficient quantities of inventory and capacity available or that they will allocate their internal resources to fulfill our requirements 
further  qualifying a new contract manufacturer and commencing volume production is expensive and time consuming 
the loss of our existing contract manufacturers  the failure of our existing contract manufacturers to satisfy their contractual obligations to us or our failure to timely qualify a new contract manufacturer to meet anticipated demand increases could result in a significant interruption in the supply of our products 
in this event  we could lose revenue and damage our customer relationships 
in addition  our business interruption insurance contains standard limitations and  as a result of these limitations  may not adequately cover damages we incur in the event of a supply interruption 
if we fail to accurately predict our manufacturing requirements  we could incur additional costs or experience manufacturing delays we use a forward looking forecast of anticipated product orders to determine our product requirements for our contract manufacturers 
the lead times for materials and components we order vary 
table of contents significantly and depend on factors such as the specific supplier  contract terms and demand for each component at a given time 
for example  some of our application specific integrated circuits have a lead time of up to six months 
if we overestimate our requirements  our contract manufacturers may have excess inventory  which we may be obligated to pay for 
if we underestimate our requirements  our contract manufacturers may have inadequate inventory  which could result in delays in delivery to our customers and our recognition of revenue 
in addition  because our contract manufacturers produce our products based on forward looking demand projections that we supply to them  we may be unable to respond quickly to sudden changes in demand 
with respect to sudden increases in demand  we may be unable to satisfy this demand with our products  thereby forfeiting revenue opportunities and damaging our customer relationships  and with respect to sudden decreases in demand  we may find ourselves with excess inventory  which could expose us to high manufacturing costs compared to our revenue in a financial quarter and increased risks of inventory obsolescence 
these factors contributed to a total of million provision for inventory write downs for fiscal year  a million charge in fiscal year  and a million charge in transition year we plan to continue introducing new and complex products  and if our contract manufacturers are unable to manufacture these products consistently and in required quantities  we could lose sales due to the complexity of our new products  the manufacturing process for these new products and or the new products themselves may require adjustments and refinements during the first several months of initial manufacture 
in addition  it may be difficult for our contract manufacturers to produce these complex products consistently with the level of quality we require 
we depend on the highly trained and knowledgeable employees of our contract manufacturers to assemble and test our products 
given the significant training required to manufacture our products  the loss of a number of these employees could also impair the ability of our contract manufacturers to produce sufficient quantities of our products in a timely manner with the quality we require 
other risks related to our business our significant sales outside the united states subject us to increasing foreign political and economic risks  including foreign currency fluctuations our sales to customers outside of the united states accounted for approximately  and of our revenue for fiscal year  and transition year  respectively 
we are seeking to expand our international presence by establishing arrangements with distribution partners as well as through strategic relationships in international markets 
consequently  we anticipate that sales outside of the united states will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue in future periods 
the sales of our products are denominated primarily in united states dollars 
as a result  increases in the value of the united states dollar relative to foreign currencies could cause our products to become less competitive in international markets and could result in reductions in sales and profitability 
to the extent our prices or expenses are denominated in foreign currencies  we will be exposed to increased risks of currency fluctuations 
our international presence subjects us to risks  including political and economic instability and changing regulatory environments in foreign countries  increased time to deliver solutions to customers due to the complexities associated with managing an international distribution system  increased time to collect receivables caused by slower payment practices in many international markets  managing export licenses  tariffs and other regulatory issues pertaining to international trade  
table of contents increased effort and costs associated with the protection of our intellectual property in foreign countries  and difficulties in hiring and managing employees in foreign countries 
we have made and may make future acquisitions or dispositions  which involve numerous risks we periodically evaluate our business and our technology needs  and evaluate alternatives for acquisitions  dispositions and other transfers of businesses  assets  technologies and product lines  and we have made  and may in the future make  acquisitions and dispositions 
any future acquisitions and or dispositions would expose us to various risks associated with such transactions and could harm our results of operations and financial condition 
although we may seek to make acquisitions  we may be unable to identify and acquire suitable businesses  assets  technology or product lines on reasonable terms  if at all 
our financial condition or stock price may make it difficult for us to complete acquisitions and we may compete for acquisitions with other companies that have substantially greater financial  management and other resources than we do 
this competition may increase the prices we pay to make acquisitions  which are often high when compared to the assets and sales of acquisition candidates 
also  our acquisitions may not generate sufficient revenue to offset increased expenses associated with the acquisition in the short term or at all 
we may also consider discontinuing or disposing of businesses  assets  technologies or product lines  however  any decision to limit our investment in or dispose of businesses  assets  technologies or product lines may result in the recording of charges to our income statement  such as inventory and technology related write downs  workforce reduction costs  contract termination costs  fixed asset write downs or claims from third party resellers or users of the discontinued products 
in addition  to the extent we are required to sell intellectual property rights in disposing of these businesses  assets  technologies or product lines  we may need to re license the right to use this intellectual property for a fee 
acquisitions and dispositions  particularly multiple transactions over a short period of time  involve transaction costs and a number of risks that may result in our failure to achieve the desired benefits of the transaction 
these risks include  among others  the following difficulties and unanticipated costs incurred in assimilating the operations of the acquired business  technologies or product lines or of segregating  marketing and disposing of a business  technology or product line  potential disruption of our existing operations  an inability to successfully integrate  train and retain key personnel  or transfer or eliminate positions or key personnel  diversion of management attention and employees from day to day operations  an inability to incorporate  develop or market acquired businesses  technologies or product lines  or realize value from technologies  products or businesses  operating inefficiencies associated with managing companies in different locations  or separating integrated operations  and impairment of relationships with employees  customers  suppliers and strategic partners 
we may finance acquisitions by issuing shares of our common stock  which could dilute our existing stockholders 
we may also use cash or incur debt to pay for these acquisitions 
in addition  we may be required to expend substantial funds to develop acquired technologies in connection with future acquisitions  which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 
we have made acquisitions and may make future acquisitions that result in in process research and development expenses being charged in a particular quarter  which could adversely affect our operating results for that quarter 

table of contents the market price of our common stock has historically been volatile  and declines in the market price of our common stock may negatively impact our ability to make future strategic acquisitions  raise capital  issue debt  and retain employees shares of our common stock may continue to experience substantial price volatility  including significant decreases  as a result of variations between our actual or anticipated financial results and the published expectations of analysts  announcements by our competitors and us  and pending class action lawsuits against us 
in addition  the stock markets have experienced extreme price fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies 
these price fluctuations have  in some cases  been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
a major decline in capital markets generally  or in the market price of our shares of common stock  may negatively impact our ability to make future strategic acquisitions  raise capital  issue debt  or retain employees 
these factors  as well as general economic and political conditions and the outcome of the pending class action lawsuits  may in turn materially adversely affect the market price of our shares of common stock 
we have not established a comprehensive disaster recovery plan and if we are unable to quickly and successfully restore our operations our revenue and our business could be harmed we have not established and tested a comprehensive disaster recovery plan for our business operations or for recovering or otherwise operating our information technology systems in the event of a catastrophic systems failure or a natural or other disaster 
if there is a natural or other disaster which impacts our operations or a failure or extended inoperability of our information technology systems  our ability to service customers  ship products  process transactions  test and develop products  and communicate internally and externally could be materially impaired and our revenue and business could be harmed 
we are in the process of developing a disaster recovery plan which we expect will conform to industry standards and is intended to limit our business and financial exposure in the event of a disaster or catastrophic systems failure 
nevertheless  in the event of a disaster or catastrophic systems failure  we may be unable to successfully implement any plan we develop and restore  or operate at an alternate location  our business or our information technology systems and  to the extent it is implemented  any plan we develop may not adequately prevent or limit the adverse effects on our business of such a disaster or catastrophic systems failure 
additionally  our business interruption insurance has certain limitations and  as a result of these limitations  may not adequately cover damages we incur in the event our business is interrupted by such a disaster or catastrophic systems failure 
provisions of our articles of incorporation and by laws and our investor rights plan could delay or prevent a change in control  which could reduce our stock price pursuant to our certificate of incorporation  our board of directors has the authority to issue preferred stock and to determine the price  rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions  including voting rights  of those shares without any vote or action by our stockholders 
the issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
our certificate of incorporation requires the affirmative vote of the holders of not less than of the outstanding shares of our capital stock for the approval or authorization of certain business combinations as described in our certificate of incorporation 
in addition  our staggered board of directors and certain advance notification requirements for submitting nominations for election to our board of directors contained in our bylaws  as well as other provisions of delaware law and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  could delay or make a change in control more difficult to accomplish 
in april  our board of directors adopted a stockholder rights plan pursuant to which we paid a dividend of one right for each share of common stock held by stockholders of record on june  as a result of the plan  our acquisition by a party not approved by our board of directors could be prohibitively expensive 
this plan is designed to protect stockholders from attempts to acquire us while our stock price is inappropriately low or on terms or through tactics that could deny all stockholders the opportunity to realize the full value of their investment 
under the plan  each right initially represents the right  under certain circumstances  to purchase  of a share of a new series of our preferred stock at 
table of contents an exercise price of per share 
initially the rights will not be exercisable and will trade with our common stock 
if a person or group acquires beneficial ownership of or more of the then outstanding shares of our common stock or announces a tender or exchange offer that would result in such person or group owning or more of our then outstanding common stock  each right would entitle its holder other than the holder or group which acquired or more of our common stock to purchase shares of our common stock having a market value of two times the exercise price of the right 
our board of directors may redeem the rights at the redemption price of 
per right  subject to adjustment  at any time prior to the earlier of june   the expiration date of the rights  or the date of distribution of the rights  as determined under the plan 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risk involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to market risk primarily related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
our hedging activity is intended to offset the impact of currency fluctuations on certain nonfunctional currency assets and liabilities 
interest rate sensitivity 
we maintain an investment portfolio consisting partly of debt securities of various issuers  types and maturities 
the securities that we classify as held to maturity are recorded on the balance sheet at amortized cost  which approximates market value 
unrealized gains or losses associated with these securities are not material 
the securities that we classify as available for sale are recorded on the balance sheet at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses reported as part of accumulated other comprehensive income  net of tax as a component of stockholders equity 
a hypothetical percent increase in interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair market value of these securities due to their short maturity 
we expect to be able to hold our fixed income investments until maturity  and therefore we do not expect our operating results or cash flows to be materially affected by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on our securities portfolio  unless we are required to liquidate these securities earlier to satisfy immediate cash flow requirements 
foreign currency exchange risk 
due to our global operating and financial activities  we are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
at january   we had net asset exposures to the australian dollar  eurodollar  japanese yen and brazilian real 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could materially harm our financial results and cash flows 
to minimize the potential adverse impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  we  at times  have used foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge the currency risk inherent in our global operations 
we do not use financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes  nor do we use leveraged financial instruments 
gains and losses on these contracts are largely offset by gains and losses on the underlying assets and liabilities 
we had no foreign exchange forward or option contracts outstanding at january  equity price risk 
we maintain a small amount of investments in marketable equity securities of publicly traded companies 
at january   these investments were considered available for sale with any unrealized gains or losses deferred as a component of stockholders equity 
it is not customary for us to make investments in equity securities of publicly traded companies as part of our investment strategy 
in the past  we have also made strategic equity and convertible debt investments in privately held technology companies  many of which are in the start up or development stage 
investments in these companies are highly illiquid and inherently risky as the technologies or products they have under development  or the services they propose to provide  are typically in early stages of development and may never materialize 
if these companies are not successful  we could lose our entire investment 
the concentration of our investments in a small number of related industries  primarily telecommunications  exposes our investments to increased risk  particularly if these industries continue to be adversely affected by the worldwide economic slowdown 
at january   these investments totaled million 
during fiscal year  we recorded impairment losses of million relating to these investments 
while our 
table of contents financial results may be materially adversely affected by fluctuations in the value of these investments  we do not expect a material impact in our cash flows
