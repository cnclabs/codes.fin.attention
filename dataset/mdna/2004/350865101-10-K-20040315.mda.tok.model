item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in thousands of dollars unless otherwise specified overview the company s results for the year ended december  were driven by strong consumer demand for yu gi oh and to a lesser extent teenage mutant ninja turtles licensed merchandise  which grew steadily throughout the year into the holiday season 
additionally  business initiatives launched during  such as the fox box  which generated advertising sales  and kids home video  were contributors to higher revenues 
the company s costs for were also significantly higher primarily due to a full twelve months of operations for the fox box 
these higher costs included the fee paid to the fox broadcasting company  programming costs  and sales  marketing and promotional costs 
general the company receives revenues from a number of sources  principally licensing  advertising media and broadcast and television and film production distribution 
the company typically derives a substantial portion of its licensing revenues from a small number of properties  which properties usually generate revenues only for a limited period of time 
because the company s licensing revenues are highly subject to the changing trends in the toy  game and entertainment business  its licensing revenues from year to year from particular sources are subject to dramatic increases and decreases 
it is not possible to precisely anticipate the length of time a property will be commercially successful  if at all 
popularity of properties can vary from months to years 
as a result  the company s revenues and net income may fluctuate significantly between comparable periods 
the company s licensing revenues have historically been derived primarily from the license of toy and game concepts 
thus  a substantial portion of the company s revenues and net income are subject to the seasonal variations of the toy and game industry 
typically  a majority of toy orders are shipped in the third and fourth calendar quarters 
in addition  the company s media buying subsidiary provides media services to a significant number of toy and video game companies which place a substantial portion of their overall annual advertising in the fourth quarter 
the company recognizes revenue from the sale of advertising time related to its lease of the fox saturday morning television block as more fully described in note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
in view of the increased demand for commercial time on the fox box by children s advertisers for the holiday season  the company s advertising sales subsidiary sells advertising time at higher rates in the fourth quarter generally resulting in higher advertising revenues for the fourth quarter 
as a result  much of these subsidiaries revenues are earned in the fourth quarter when the majority of toy and video game advertising occurs 
in the company s usual experience for many of the reasons stated above  the company s revenues during the second half of the year have generally been greater than during the first half of the year 
however  the company s revenues in the most recent fiscal years have been heavily influenced by popularity trends of yu gi oh  pok mon and teenage mutant ninja turtles and advertising revenue derived from the sale of commercial time on the fox box which is typically sold with a guaranteed audience delivery  rather than the historical seasonal trends of toy and game sales 
further  revenue fluctuations result from guarantee and minimum royalty payments occurring throughout the year  some of which are recognized as revenue upon the execution and delivery of license agreements 
critical accounting policies this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the company continually evaluates the policies and estimates it uses to prepare its consolidated financial statements 
in  general  management s estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience  known trends or events  information from third party professionals and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making the judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
our accounting policies are more fully described in note of the notes to the company s consolidated financial statements 
below is a summary of the critical accounting policies  among others  that management believes involve significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company has revenue recognition policies for its various operating segments  which are appropriate to the circumstances of each business 
see note of the notes to the company s consolidated financial statements for a discussion of these revenue recognition policies 
the company records reductions to revenues for estimated future returns of merchandise  primarily home video products 
these estimates are based on trends and projections of customer demand for and acceptance of various products 
differences may result in the amount and timing of the company s revenue for any period if actual performance varies from these estimates 
in addition  the company records a reduction to advertising revenue for any under delivered audience guarantees with regard to advertising time sold on the fox box 
film and television costs film and television costs in accordance with statement of position no 
 accounting by producers or distributors of films sop  management s judgment is required as it relates to total revenues to be received and costs to be incurred throughout the life of each program or its license period  to determine the amortization of capitalized film and television programming costs associated with revenues earned and any fair value adjustments 
film and television programming costs are amortized in the consolidated statements of income in the direct proportion that revenues currently recognized bears to management s estimate of total future revenues to be received throughout the life of each motion picture or television program 
estimates of revenues are reviewed and reassessed periodically on a title by title basis 
fox broadcast fee fox broadcast agreement the company leases from fox its television network s saturday morning programming block 
the cost of the fox box has been and will be capitalized and amortized over the broadcast season based on estimated advertising revenue 
in developing future estimated revenues  the company has made certain assumptions with regard to the anticipated popularity of the television programs the company broadcasts on the fox box and the general market demand and pricing of advertising time for saturday morning children s broadcast television 
the popularity of such programs impacts audience levels and the level of the network advertising rates that the company can charge 
these estimates are based on historical trends  as well as the company s subjective judgment of future customer demand and acceptance of its television programming 
differences may result in the amount and timing of revenue for any period if actual performance varies from the company s estimates

forward looking information and risk factors that may affect future results the private securities litigation reform act of provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company 
we may from time to time make written or oral statements that are forward looking  including statements contained in this report and other filings with the securities and exchange commission and in reports to our stockholders 
these forward looking statements may relate to such matters as anticipated financial performance  business prospects  technological developments new products  research and development activities  liquidity  and similar matters or to developments beyond our control  including changes in domestic or global economic conditions 
forward looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties and are made on the basis of management s views and assumptions as of the time the statements are made 
there can be no assurance  however  that our expectations will necessarily come to pass 
a variety of factors could cause our actual results and experience to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed or anticipated in our forward looking statements 
the factors listed below are illustrative and other risks and uncertainties may arise as are or may be detailed from time to time in our public announcements and filings with the securities and exchange commission 
the company s revenues are subject to the high volatility of consumer preferences with respect to entertainment 
the company s business and operating results ultimately depend upon the appeal of our properties  product concepts and programming to consumers 
a decline in the popularity of our existing properties or the failure of new properties and product concepts to achieve and sustain market acceptance could result in reduced overall revenues  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
consumer preferences with respect to entertainment are continuously changing and are difficult to predict and can vary from months to years 
entertainment properties often have short life cycles 
there can be no assurances that any of our current properties  product concepts or programming will continue to be popular for any significant period of time  any new properties  product concepts or programming we represent or produce will achieve an adequate degree of popularity  or any property s life cycle will be sufficient to permit us to profitably recover advance payments  guarantees  development  marketing  royalties and other costs 
our failure to successfully anticipate  identify and react to consumer preferences could have a material adverse effect on our revenues  profitability and results of operations 
in addition  the volatility of consumer preferences may cause our revenues and net income to vary significantly between comparable periods 
a substantial portion of our licensing revenue typically derives from a small number of properties 
we typically derive a substantial portion of our licensing revenues from a small number of properties  which properties usually generate revenues only for a limited period of time 
because our licensing revenues are highly subject to the changing trends in the toy  game and entertainment business  our licensing revenues from year to year from particular sources are subject to dramatic increases and decreases 
our business is typically seasonal and therefore our annual operating results will depend significantly on our performance during the holiday season 
sales of our licensed toy and game concepts are seasonal  with a majority of retail sales occurring during the third and fourth calendar quarters 
the revenues of summit media  which provides media services to a significant number of toy and video game companies  and kids ad sales  which sells advertising time for the fox box  are also seasonal  with a significant portion of the revenue typically generated during the fourth quarter commensurate with the demand for commercial time by children s advertisers for the holiday season 
in addition  a failure by us to supply programming on fox box which attracts viewers during the holiday season could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
as a result of the seasonal nature of our business  we would be significantly and adversely affected by unforeseen events  such as a terrorist attack or a military engagement  that negatively affect the retail environment or consumer buying patterns  if such events were to impact the key selling season 
we may not be able to successfully protect our intellectual property rights 
we rely on a combination of trade secret  copyright  trademark  patent and other proprietary rights laws to protect the intellectual property we own or license 
third parties may try to challenge the ownership by the company or its licensors of such intellectual property 
in addition  our business is subject to the risk of third parties infringing on the intellectual property rights of the company or its licensors and producing counterfeit products 
we may need to resort to litigation in the future to protect the intellectual property rights of the company or its licensors  which could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business and competitive position 
we may be negatively affected by adverse general economic conditions 
current conditions in the domestic and global economies are extremely uncertain 
adverse changes may occur as a result of softening global economies  wavering consumer confidence caused by the threat or occurrence of terrorist attacks such as those in the us on september   war  or other factors affecting economic conditions generally 
such changes could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
other factors may affect our performance 
a wide range of factors could materially affect our performance  including the following changes in company wide or business unit strategies  which may result in changes in the types or mix of businesses in which the company is involved or chooses to invest  technological developments that may affect the distribution of the company s creative products or create new risks to the company s ability to protect its intellectual property  labor disputes  which may lead to increased costs or disruption of operations in any of the company s business units  international  political and military developments that may  among other things  result in increases in broadcasting costs or loss of advertising revenue due to pre emptions of the fox box

this list of factors that may affect future performance and the accuracy of forward looking statements are illustrative  but by no means exhaustive
