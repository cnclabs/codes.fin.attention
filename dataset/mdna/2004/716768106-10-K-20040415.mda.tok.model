item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations except for the historical information contained herein  the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could materially differ from those discussed here 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in this section  as well as in the sections entitled compensation  distribution  information systems  government regulation  and business risks included in item part i of this annual report on form k 
overview based on our sales of billion  we are the leading provider of products  services  and solutions for the lifetime needs of pets in north america 
as of february   we operated retail stores in north america  typically ranging in size from  to  square feet 
we also reach customers through our direct marketing channels  including petsmart 
com  the internet s most popular pet e commerce site  a separate web site dedicated to equine products  and two major branded catalogs 
we complement our extensive product assortment with a wide selection of value added pet services  including grooming and pet training 
virtually all our stores offer complete pet training services and feature pet styling salons that provide high quality grooming services 
in addition  through our strategic relationship with banfield  the pet hospital  full service veterinary care is available in approximately of our stores 
during  we opened net new stores  and remodeled the final group of approximately stores under a new store format 
the new store format eliminates most of the high steel shelving  organizes consumable and hard good products by pet species  and also places a stronger visual emphasis on in store services like pet training  grooming  adoptions  and veterinary care 
we continue to invest in training for our approximately  associates as part of our on going cultural shift with an emphasis on customer service and providing pet solutions 
in  we expect to open approximately new stores  net of store closures 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and 
table of contents judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates for reserves for inventory shrinkage  store closures  insurance liabilities and reserves  and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
under different assumptions or conditions  actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates we use in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
inventory shrinkage reserves our stores perform physical inventories once a year  and in between the physical inventories  the stores perform cycle counts on certain inventory items 
our forward distribution centers and distribution centers perform cycle counts encompassing all inventory items every quarter 
therefore  as of a reporting period  there will be stores with certain inventory items that have not been counted 
due to the holiday season  the majority of the stores do not perform physical inventories during the last quarter of the fiscal year  but continue to perform cycle counts on certain inventory items 
therefore  as of each reporting period presented  we estimate the inventory shrinkage reserve for un inventoried sales based on a two year historical trend analysis by store 
as of february   and february   we have reserved approximately million and million  respectively  for inventory shrinkage 
reserve for closed stores we continuously evaluate the performance of our retail stores and periodically close those that are under performing 
we establish reserves for future rental payments on closed stores and terminated subleases in the period the store is closed  in accordance with financial accounting standards board  or fasb  statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
these costs are classified in general and administrative expenses 
we calculate the costs for future rental payments associated with closed stores using the net present value method  at a credit adjusted risk free interest rate  over the remaining life of the lease  net of expected sublease income 
judgment is used to estimate the underlying real estate market related to the expected sublease income and timing of the sublease start date  and we can make no assurances that additional charges to these stores will not be required based on the changing real estate environment 
as of february   and february   we had  respectively  and stores included in our closed store reserves  of which and nine were under sublease agreements 
we have assumed that as of february   five additional stores will have sublease income in future periods  which represents a million reduction to the reserve 
if these sublease assumptions were extended by a year  the reserve would increase by approximately million 
we closed seven stores in fiscal  of which one store closed as scheduled due to lease expiration  compared to four stores in fiscal as of february   and february   the total remaining discounted gross rents for such closed stores was million and million  respectively  which was reduced by expected sublease income of million and million  respectively  for a net balance of approximately million and million  respectively  for closed store reserves 
insurance liabilities and reserves we maintain standard property and casualty insurance on all our properties and leasehold interests  product liability insurance that covers products and the sale of live pets  self insured health plans  and worker compensation insurance 
property insurance covers approximately million in buildings and contents  including furniture and fixtures  leasehold improvements  and inventory 
under our casualty and workers compensation insurance policies through january   we retain the initial risk of loss of million for each policy per occurrence 
effective february   we engaged a new insurance provider 
under our casualty and workers compensation insurance policies with the new provider  we retain an initial risk of loss of million for each policy per occurrence on or subsequent to february  we establish reserves for losses based on independent actuarial estimates of the amount of loss inherent in that period s claims  including losses for which claims have been incurred but not reported 
loss estimates rely on actuarial observations of ultimate loss experience for similar historical events  and changes in such assumptions could result in an adjustment to the reserves 
as of february   and february   we had approximately million and million  respectively  in reserves related to casualty  self insured health plans and workers compensation insurance policies 

table of contents income taxes we establish deferred income tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between the financial reporting bases and the income tax bases of our assets and liabilities at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such assets or liabilities are realized or settled 
we record a valuation allowance on the deferred income tax assets to reduce the total to an amount management believes is more likely than not to be realized 
valuation allowances at february   and february   were principally to offset certain deferred income tax assets for operating and capital loss carryforwards

the increase in services revenue  which includes grooming  training and our petshotel operations  was due primarily to increased traffic 
the decrease in revenue from direct marketing channels was from lower pet catalog sales  due to a decision to reduce circulation and advertising in the first half of  and lower e commerce sales

the result of this shift in focus is higher depreciation expense  which partially offset the rent expense reduction 
in addition  reductions of operating expenses in the direct marketing channels contributed to the decrease due primarily to the benefits obtained from their integration in the first half of advertising expenses decreased due primarily to reductions in store and direct marketing channels advertising in the first half of the year  as well as reductions in catalog distribution during  compared with an increase in store incentive bonus expenses as a result of our performance in partially offset the improvements for  compared with general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of net sales to for  from for in  we recorded million related to litigation settlement and costs  which represented of sales

in addition  dividends paid to stockholders approximated million in net cash provided by financing activities for was million 
common stock and notes purchase program in april  our board of directors approved the purchase of up to million of common stock or notes annually for each of the next three years 
in  we used million to purchase our notes with a face value of million 
in february and march  the remaining balance of million of notes was called for redemption  resulting in the repurchase of notes for approximately million in cash and the conversion of the remainder into approximately  shares of common stock at a conversion price of per share 
in march  the board of directors extended the term of the purchase of our common stock for an additional three years through march  and increased the authorized amount of annual purchases to million 
our policy on the purchase of our common stock is to make market purchases when the price is advantageous and as cash flow allows  maintaining appropriate liquidity 
during  we purchased approximately  shares of our common stock for million  at an average price of per share 
common stock dividends on june   the board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of per share that was paid november   to stockholders of record on october  on december   the board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of per share payable on february   to stockholders of record on january  we believe our ability to generate cash allows us to invest in the growth of the business and  at the same time  distribute a quarterly dividend 
in  approximately million were paid to stockholders 
on march   the board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of per share payable on may   to stockholders of record on april  common stock offering in july  we filed a registration statement on form s for a public offering of  shares of our common stock  plus an over allotment option of  shares 
of these shares   were offered by entities affiliated with carrefour sa  and we offered  shares  plus the shares in the over allotment option 
on august   we completed the sale of the  shares of common stock for per share  resulting in proceeds  net of underwriting fees  of approximately million 
on august   the underwriters exercised the over allotment option and purchased  additional shares for per share  resulting in proceeds  net of underwriting fees  of approximately million 
we incurred costs associated with the offering of approximately million 
operating capital and capital expenditure requirements all our stores are leased facilities 
we opened net new stores  and reformatted stores in each new store requires capital expenditures of approximately million for fixtures  equipment and leasehold improvements  approximately million for inventory  and approximately million for preopening costs 
in the first year  we expect a new store to generate approximately million in sales 
we expect new stores to generate comparable store sales growth in the range of to in year two  to in year three  to in year four  and to in year five 
to convert a store to our new store format costs approximately million per store 
based on our current plan for approximately net new stores during  as well as our planned investment in the 
table of contents development of our information systems  we expect capital spending to be approximately to million for we believe our existing cash and cash equivalents  together with cash flows from operations  borrowing capacity under our bank credit facility and available lease financing  will provide adequate funds for our foreseeable working capital needs  planned capital expenditures and debt service obligations 
our ability to fund our operations  make planned capital expenditures  scheduled debt payments  and refinance indebtedness  depends on our future operating performance and cash flow  which are subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors  some of which are beyond our control 
any future increases in net sales and net income will depend on the opening of additional stores and the improved performance of existing stores 
in view of the increasing maturity of our store base an average age of approximately six years as of february   as well as the planned opening of additional stores in existing markets  which may diminish sales of existing stores  we anticipate that comparable store sales increases may be lower in future periods 
as a result of our expansion plans  we anticipate the timing of new store openings  related preopening costs  and the amount of revenue contributed by new and existing stores may cause our quarterly results of operations to fluctuate 
in addition  because new stores tend to experience higher payroll  advertising  and other store level expenses as a percentage of sales than mature stores  the impact of new store openings will also contribute to lower store operating margins until they become established 
we charge preopening costs associated with each new location to expense as the costs are incurred 
lease and other commitments operating and capital lease commitments the following table summarizes our contractual obligations  net of estimated sublease income  at february   and the effect that such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in thousands payments due in fiscal year and contractual obligation beyond total operating lease obligations capital lease obligations total at february   we had no long term debt or purchase obligations

the operating lease payment schedule above is shown net of estimated sublease income 
sublease income for operating and capital leases is as follows in thousands sublease income thereafter letters of credit we issue letters of credit for guarantees provided for insurance programs  capital leases and utilities 
as of february   million was outstanding under our letters of credit 

table of contents structured lease facilities we previously entered into lease agreements for certain stores as part of a structured lease financing 
the structured lease financing facilities provided a special purpose entity  not affiliated with us  with the necessary financing to complete the acquisition and construction of new stores 
once construction was completed  another special purpose entity  also not affiliated with us  leased the completed stores to us for a four year term 
after the four year term expired  we were required to pay the balance of the financing  provide for the sale of the properties to a third party  or pay a guaranteed residual amount 
the special purpose entity was created specifically to hold the properties  which consisted of two land parcels and seven stores 
it engaged in no other business activity 
in april  we made the decision to purchase the two land parcels  and based on appraisals  we recorded a million loss in the consolidated financial statements for during  we completed this transaction and no further loss was recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
in june  the seven stores under the structured leasing facility were sold to a third party by the special purpose entity lessor 
the buyer of the properties paid all principal amounts owing on the financing  and we paid all accrued interest of approximately million 
we recorded no material gain or loss in this transaction 
we immediately entered into lease agreements for the seven stores with the third party buyer 
based on the lease terms  the lease agreements for six of the seven buildings resulted in capital lease treatment under sfas no 
 accounting for leases 
as a result  we recognized capital lease assets and related obligations of approximately million upon execution of the lease agreements 
one of the buildings and the related land for all seven stores are classified as operating leases 
these transactions have eliminated any arrangements between special purpose entities and us 
related party transactions we have an investment in mmi holdings  inc  or mmih  a provider of veterinary and other pet related services 
mmih  through a wholly owned subsidiary  medical management international  inc  or mmi  operates full service veterinary hospitals and wellness hospitals inside over half our stores  under the name banfield  the pet hospital 
philip l 
francis  our chairman and chief executive officer  and robert f 
moran  our president and chief operating officer  are members of the board of directors of mmih 
our investment consists of common and convertible preferred stock 
as of february   we owned approximately of the voting stock  and approximately of the combined voting and non voting stock of mmih 
we charge mmi licensing fees for the space used by the veterinary hospitals  and we treat this income as a reduction of the retail stores occupancy costs 
we record occupancy costs as a component of cost of sales in our consolidated financial statements 
licensing fees are determined by fixed costs per square foot  adjusted for the number of days the hospitals are open and sales volumes achieved 
we recognized licensing fees of approximately million  million  and million during   and respectively 
licensing fees receivable from mmi totaled million and million at february   and february   respectively  and were included in receivables in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
credit facility at our option  on november   we amended our credit facility to reduce the available commitment to million  extend the maturity by two years to april   and amended certain covenants 
the credit facility permits us to pay dividends  so long as we are not in default or the payment of dividends would not result in default 
the credit facility is secured by substantially all our personal property assets and certain real property 
we pay a fee to the lenders each quarter at an annual rate of of the unused amount of the credit facility 
as of february   we had no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility  however  we issue letters of credit for guarantees provided for insurance programs  capital lease agreements  and utilities 
seasonality and inflation our business is subject to some seasonal fluctuations and we typically realize a higher portion of our net sales and operating profits during the fourth quarter 
as a result of this seasonality  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and that these comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
in addition  sales of certain products and services designed to address pet health needs are seasonal 
because our stores typically draw customers from a large trade area  sales may also be impacted by adverse weather or travel conditions  which are more prevalent during certain seasons of the year 

table of contents our results of operations and financial position are presented based upon historical cost 
although we cannot accurately anticipate the effect of inflation on our operations  we do not believe inflation is likely to materially harm our net sales or results of operations 
recent accounting pronouncements the fasb issued fasb interpretation  or fin   consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  on january  fin requires that an entity holding a majority of the variable interest of a variable interest entity must consolidate the operations of that variable interest entity of which it is the primary beneficiary 
in  we purchased two properties from the structured lease financing facility  and based on current appraisals  we recorded a million loss in the consolidated financial statements 
subsequent to this purchase and also in  the structured lease financing facility was liquidated and the remaining seven stores were leased by the company 
fin was effective for us on august  with the liquidation of our special purpose entity during  fin did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in march  the fasb s emerging issues task force  or eitf  reached a consensus on issue  accounting by a customer including a reseller for cash consideration received from a vendor 
the transition provisions apply prospectively to arrangements with vendors entered into or modified after december   do not allow for prior period reclassification  and require companies to account for all amounts received from vendors as a reduction of the cost of the products purchased unless certain criteria are met that allow companies to account for vendor funding as a reduction of related selling  general  and administrative expenses 
during and  we recorded approximately million and million  respectively  for cooperative promotional income 
we adopted the provisions of eitf for vendor contracts entered into or modified subsequent to december   and the adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
in november  the fasb s emerging issues task force reached a consensus on issue  application of issue no 
by resellers to sales incentives offered to consumers by manufacturers 
under eitf  any cash consideration a company receives from a vendor as part of a sales incentive arrangement must be recorded in the income statement as an offset to cost of sales  and cannot be recorded as revenue  unless the company meets certain criteria 
eitf is effective for new arrangements  including modifications to existing arrangements  entered into fiscal periods beginning after november  we are currently assessing the impact  if any  regarding the adoption of eitf other information consistent with section a i of the securities exchange act of  as added by section of the sarbanes oxley act of  petsmart is responsible for listing the non audit services approved in the fourth quarter of by the petsmart audit committee to be performed by deloitte touche llp  our independent auditor 
non audit services are defined in the law as services other than those provided in connection with an audit or a review of the financial statements of petsmart 
the non audit services approved by the audit committee in the fourth quarter ended february  were for information systems audit support services 
the service has been approved in accordance with a pre approval from the audit committee or the committee s chairman pursuant to delegated authority by the committee 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s we are subject to certain market risks arising from transactions in the normal course of our business 
such risk is principally associated with interest rate and foreign exchange fluctuations  as well as changes in our credit standing 
in addition  a market risk exists associated with the current fuel price 
we are assessing the impact the fuel prices might have on our gross margins  as well as the possibility of increasing retail prices in certain products to minimize the impact on our results of operations and financial position 
interest rate risk we use a revolving line of credit and short term bank borrowings to support seasonal working capital needs and to finance capital requirements of the business 
there were no borrowings during borrowings under the revolving line of credit bear interest at the bank s prime rate plus to or libor plus to  at our option 

table of contents foreign currency risk our canadian subsidiary operates stores and uses the canadian dollar as the functional currency and the united states dollar as the reporting currency 
we have certain exposures to foreign currency risk 
however  we believe that such exposure does not present a significant risk due to a relatively limited number of transactions and accounts denominated in foreign currency 
approximately million or of our revenues for  were denominated in the canadian dollar 
transaction gains and losses on united states dollar denominated transactions are recorded within general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations  and were million in exchange loss for
