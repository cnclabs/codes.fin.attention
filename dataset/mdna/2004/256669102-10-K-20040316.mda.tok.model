the following text contains references to years    and  which represent fiscal years ending or ended january   january   january   and february   respectively  each of which will be or was a week accounting period 
this discussion and analysis should be read with  and is qualified in its entirety by  the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 
executive overview 
in  the company hired a new chief executive officer  a new president and chief operating officer and a new executive vice president of store operations 
during the year  the company focused on the following seven operating initiatives the opening of new stores  the continued implementation of the seven habits store retailing program which was designed to improve store level execution of certain key processes 
this program was recently redefined as a result of the change in senior management in the store operations area  the addition of coolers which allow the company s stores to carry perishable products in  stores  bringing the total number of stores with coolers to  at january   the rollout of automatic inventory replenishment to  stores  bringing the total number of stores on automatic replenishment to  at january testing the acceptance of debit cards in five states  credit cards in four states and electronic benefit transfers ebt in four states  a multi faceted program focused on shrink which included the development and implementation of a comprehensive shrink reduction action plan  and the selection of a location for its eighth distribution center and the resulting announcement of plans to build that facility in union county  south carolina 
in  the company will focus its efforts on accomplishing the following operating initiatives opening new dollar general stores and new dollar general market stores  expanding stores into three additional states arizona  new mexico  and wisconsin  expanding its distribution centers in ardmore  oklahoma and south boston  virginia and beginning construction of the new distribution center in south carolina  implementing a merchandising data warehouse  maintaining an acceptable in stock level on all core items as well as for its fastest moving items  a store work flow project being undertaken with the assistance of mckinsey and company  a continued focus on shrink reduction efforts  particularly at high shrink stores  the addition of coolers in approximately  existing stores and the installation of coolers in virtually all new stores  improving the merchandising productivity of its stores that have more than  square feet of selling space  the potential expansion of its debit and credit card and ebt test  increasing its emphasis on opportunistic inventory purchases  and the stabilization  or reduction of  its retail management turnover rate 
the company can provide no assurance that it will be successful in executing these initiatives nor can the company guarantee that the successful implementation of these initiatives will result in superior financial performance 
in addition to undertaking the operating initiatives described above  the company also intends to monitor and or analyze the status of certain other issues 
those issues are likely to include the status of the company s rating agency debt ratings  the analysis of the appropriate level of share repurchases for in the company spent million repurchasing approximately million shares  and may consider increasing its share repurchases in  the impact on the company  if any  from recent legislation affecting the number of hours that truck drivers can operate their trucks  the progress of the wage and hour collective action litigation in the state of alabama discussed more fully in note to the consolidated financial statements  the effectiveness of its newly formed global sourcing subsidiary that replaces certain aspects of its importing process which had previously been outsourced to a third party  the company s plans to install some additional fixtures in over three quarters of its existing stores and the potential for this disruption to have a temporary negative impact on same store sales  and the company s progress toward fulfilling its sarbanes oxley internal controls certification process which must be completed before the filing of its annual report on form k in early the company measures itself against seven key financial metrics that it believes provide a well balanced perspective regarding its overall financial health 
those metrics are as follows  together with how they are computed earnings per share eps growth current year eps minus prior year eps divided by prior year eps equals percentage change which is an indicator of the increased returns generated for the company s shareholders 
total net sales growth current year total net sales minus prior year total net sales divided by prior year total net sales equals percentage change which indicates  among other things  the success of the company s selection of new store locations and merchandising strategies 
operating margin rate operating profit divided by net sales which is an indicator of the company s success in leveraging its fixed costs and managing its variable costs 
return on invested capital numerator net income plus interest expense  net of tax  plus rent expense  net of tax  denominator average long term debt plus average shareholders equity  both measured at the end of the latest five fiscal quarters  plus average rent expense multiplied by eight 
average rent expense is computed using a two year period 
although this measure is a non gaap measure  the company believes it is useful because return on invested capital measures the efficiency of the company s capital deployed in its operations 
free cash flow the sum of net cash flows from operating activities  net cash flows from investing activities and net cash flows from financing activities  excluding share repurchases and changes in debt other than required payments 
although this measure is a non gaap measure  the company believes it is useful as an indicator of the cash flow generating capacity of the company s operations 
it is also a useful metric to analyze in conjunction with net income to determine whether there is any significant non cash component to the company s net income 
inventory turns cost of goods sold for the year divided by average inventory balances  at cost  measured at the end of the latest five fiscal quarters which is an indicator of how well the company is managing the largest asset on its balance sheet 
return on average assets net income for the year divided by average total assets  measured at the end of the latest five fiscal quarters  an overall indicator of the company s effectiveness in deploying its resources 
the company computes the above metrics using both gaap and certain non gaap information 
as discussed further below under results of operations  the company generally excludes non recurring items  such as the restatement related items  to more effectively evaluate the company s performance on a comparable and ongoing basis 
the company also pays particular attention to its same store sales growth  which is a sub category of its total sales growth  and its shrink performance  which is a sub category of its operating margin rate 
in and  the company experienced same store sales growth of and  respectively 
in and  the company s shrink  expressed in retail dollars as a percentage of sales  was and  respectively 
results of operations the following discussion of the company s financial performance is based on the consolidated financial statements set forth herein 
the company has included in this document certain financial information not derived in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  such as selling  general and administrative sg a expenses  net income and diluted earnings per share that exclude the impact of restatement related items 
the company believes that this information is useful to investors as it indicates more clearly the company s comparative year to year operating results 
this information should not be considered a substitute for any measures derived in accordance with gaap 
management may use this information to better understand the company s underlying operating results

increases in net sales resulted primarily from net new stores and a same store sales increase of in compared to  and net new stores and a same store sales increase of in compared to same store sales calculations for a given period include only those stores that were open both at the end of that period and at the beginning of the preceding fiscal year 
the company monitors its sales internally by the four major categories noted in the table above 
the company s merchandising strategy in recent years has been to place a greater emphasis on faster turning consumable products and to give less prominence to slower turning home products and clothing 
the company believes that this strategy has enabled it to better serve its customers while improving its inventory turns 
as a result of this strategy  ove r the past three years the highly consumable category has become a greater percentage of the company s overall sales mix while the percentages of the home products and basic clothing categories have declined 
the company s same store sales increase in over of  or million  was due to a number of factors  including but not limited to increased sales of candy and snacks of million  which can be partially attributed to the introduction of new items and the placement of many of the items in this category near the front of the store  an increase of million in sales of health and beauty aids items due primarily to improved in stocks and increased sales of certain over the counter medications  an increase of million in sales of pet supplies primarily due to the success of private label pet foods and the addition during the year of certain pet accessories  an increase of approximately million in sales of perishable products primarily due to the increase in the number of stores with coolers  and an increase of million in sales of hard go ods due primarily to expanded offerings of automotive products 
the company s same store sales increase in over of  or million  was due to a number of factors  including but not limited to the introduction of approximately new items in the highly consumable category which  net of the sales of the items they replaced  generated an estimated million increase in same store sales  a strong performance of seasonal merchandise in the first half of  which increased same store sales by an estimated million during that period  a portion of which the company attributes to the introduction of new outdoor items and the staging of warm weather items in its stores earlier than in prior years  an increase of approximately million in sales of perishable products primarily due to the increase in the number of stores with coolers  and improved ordering practices by its store employees 
gross profit 
the gross profit rate increased basis points in as compared with primarily due to the following higher initial mark ups on merchandise received during as compared with approximately basis points of gross margin improvement 
this improvement was achieved primarily from increased purchases of higher margin seasonal and home product items  a increase in imported purchases  which carry higher than average mark ups  and a increase in various performance based vendor rebates 
a reduction in the company s shrink provision from in to in  calculated using retail dollars as a percentage of sales approximately basis points of gross margin improvement  at cost 
the company made progress in reducing the shrink at problem stores during but generally fell short of corporate goals 
the recorded in the current year exceeds the shrinkage rate recorded in each of the four fiscal years between and   and  respectively and also exceeded the company s internal plan for some of the actions taken by the company to combat shrink beginning in included the development of an asset protection department devoted to reducing shrink losses  the installation and utilization of software that identifies unusual cash register transactions  increasing the emphasis o f shrink in the store bonus plan and the establishment of a multi disciplinary shrink task force that has developed a comprehensive shrink reduction action plan  which included the increased use of closed circuit television monitors and burglar alarms  a specific high shrink store action plan  the creation of various shrink awareness tools and the production of various exception reports to identify high risk stores 
as mentioned in the executive overview above  a continued emphasis on shrink reduction has been identified as a significant operating initiative for higher average mark ups on the company s beginning inventory in as compared to approximately basis points of gross margin improvement 
this increased average mark up represents the cumulative impact of higher margin purchases over time 
a reduction in transportation expenses as a percentage of sales approximately basis points of gross margin improvement 
this reduction resulted primarily from system enhancements and improved process efficiencies in managing outbound freight costs  which contributed to an approximate decline in outbound cost per carton delivered in as compared to these components of margin  which all positively impacted the company s results  were partially offset by the impact of the company s lifo valuation adjustments in the fourth quarters of versus approximately basis points of gross margin decline 
in  the company recorded an million lifo adjustment  which had the effect of increasing gross margin and primarily resulted from the company s ability to lower its product costs through effective purchasing methods and the general lack of inflation during the period 
the company did not benefit from a comparable adjustment in primarily because the lifo reserves in certain inventory departments had been reduced to nominal amounts  or zero  in or prior years 
an increase in markdowns of basis points 
the increase in markdowns was due principally to increased christmas related markdowns compared to those the company had taken in the past and  to a lesser extent  markdowns taken to assist with the sale of both discontinued and slower moving apparel items 
the slight decline in the gross profit rate in as compared with was due primarily to an increase in the company s shrinkage provision from in to in  calculated using retail dollars as a percentage of sales 
as discussed above  the company has taken several actions to combat shrink and continues to focus on this effort 
the company improved its initial margin on inventory purchases in all four of its major categories in as compared against  which partially offset the increase in the shrinkage provision 
however  the continued shift in the company s sales mix to lower margin highly consumable items noted above limited the year over year increase in the total initial margin rate to basis points 
the company recorded an million adjustment and a million adjustment in the fourth quarters o f and  respectively  pertaining to its lifo valuation  which had the effect of increasing gross profit in both years 
these adjustments were primarily the result of the company s ability to lower its product costs through effective purchasing methods and the general lack of inflation 
distribution and transportation costs decreased by approximately seven and six basis points  respectively  as a percentage of sales in as compared to the reduction in distribution costs as a percentage of sales was due primarily to occupancy and depreciation expenses that grew at a rate less than the sales increase  while the reduction in transportation costs as a percentage of sales was due primarily to freight expenses that grew at a rate less than the sales increase 
occupancy costs represented a decline of approximately five basis points as a percentage of sales in as compared to  due primarily to reduced rental and real property tax expenses as a percentage of sales 
depreciation expenses represented a decline of approximately three basis points as a percentage of sales in as compared to  due primarily to the fact that dis tribution center depreciation is relatively fixed in comparison with the growth in the company s sales base 
factors contributing to the reduction in freight expense as a percentage of sales in include lower fuel costs during the first half of the year and an effective freight revenue sharing program whereby the company picks up product directly from its vendors as opposed to having it shipped  each of which resulted in a decline of approximately four basis points as a percentage of sales in as compared to selling  general and administrative sg a expense 
the increase in sg a expense as a percentage of sales  excluding restatement related expenses primarily professional fees  in as compared with was due to a number of factors including but not limited to increases in the following expense categories that were in excess of the percentage increase in sales store labor increased primarily due to increases in store training related costs  the cost of workers compensation and other insurance programs increased primarily due to an increase in medical inflation costs experienced by the company compared to previous years  store occupancy costs increased primarily due to rising average monthly rentals associated with the company s leased store locations  and higher bonus expense increased related to the company s financial performance during the increase in sg a expense as a percentage of sales  excluding restatement related expenses  in as compared with was due to a number of factors including but not limited to increases in the following expense categories that were in excess of the percentage increase in sales store labor increased primarily due to continued efforts to improve store conditions by both increasing the total number of hours worked in the stores and the average wage of the store employees  the cost of workers compensation and other insurance programs increased primarily due to higher average medical costs relating to worker s compensation claims and increased premiums for directors and officers insurance  store occupancy costs increased primarily due to rising common area maintenance costs associated with leased store locatio ns  and store repairs and maintenance increased primarily due to increased floor cleaning expenses and higher fixture repair costs 
penalty and litigation settlement proceeds 
as more fully discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company accrued million in with respect to a civil penalty related to its agreement in principle with the securities and exchange commission sec staff to settle the matters arising out of the company s financial restatement 
in  the company recorded million in net litigation settlement proceeds  which amount included million in insurance proceeds associated with the settlement of the restatement related class action and shareholder derivative litigation offset by a million settlement of a shareholder class action opt out claim related to the company s restatement 
interest expense  net 
the decrease in net interest expense over the period from to is due primarily to debt reduction achieved during and the average daily total debt outstanding over the past three years was as follows million at an average interest rate of  million at an average interest rate of  and million at an average interest rate of 
the increase in the company s average interest rate over the periods above is due primarily to the reduction of variable rate debt 
all of the company s outstanding indebtedness at january  is fixed rate debt 
provision for taxes on income 
the effective income tax rates for  and were  and  respectively 
the higher tax rate in is due primarily to the million penalty accrual discussed above which will not be deductible for income tax purposes 
the lower effective tax rate in was primarily due to recording higher work opportunity tax credits than in and the favorable resolution of certain state tax related items during liquidity and capital resources current financial condition recent developments 
during the past three years  the company has generated over billion in cash flows from operating activities 
during that period  the company has expanded the number of stores it operates by   stores and has incurred million in capital expenditures  primarily to support this growth 
also during this three year period  the company has reduced its long term debt by million 
the company is involved in a number of legal actions and claims in the ordinary course of business  some of which could potentially result in a material cash settlement 
in addition  the company is involved in a collective action pending in the united states district court for the northern district of alabama 
if the company is not successful in defending that action  it could result in a material cash settlement 
the company also has certain income tax related contingencies as more fully described below under critical accounting policies and estimates 
estimates of these contingent liabilities are included in the company s consolidated financial statements 
however  future negative developments could have a material adverse effect on the company s liquidity 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
the company s inventory balance represented over of its total assets as of january  the company s proficiency in managing its inventory balances can have a significant impact on the company s cash flows from operations during a given fiscal year 
for example  in  changes in inventory balances represented a million use of cash while in  changes in inventory balances represented an million source of cash 
inventory turns  which increased from times in to and times in and  respectively  contributed to the improved cash flows 
a substantial portion of the jobs credit programs utilized by the company to reduce its federal income tax liability expired as of december  for new employees hired after that date 
currently  there is legislation pending in congress that will reinstate these credits on a retroactive basis 
while the enactment of this legislation is expected  its passage is not certain 
the company anticipates that its income tax liability will increase by approximately million if these credit programs are not re enacted on a retroactive basis 
on march   the board of directors authorized the company to repurchase up to million shares of its outstanding common stock 
purchases may be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions from time to time subject to market conditions 
the objective of the share repurchase program is to enhance shareholder value by purchasing shares at a price that produces a return on investment that is greater than the company s cost of capital 
additionally  share repurchases will be undertaken only if such purchases result in an accretive impact on the company s fully diluted earnings per share calculation 
this authorization expires march  during  the company purchased approximately million shares at a total cost of million 
the following table summarizes the company s significant contractual obligations as of january   which excludes the effect of imputed interest in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total yr yrs yrs yrs long term debt a capital lease obligations financing obligations inventory purchase obligations operating leases total contractual cash obligations a as discussed below  represents unsecured notes whose holders have a redemption option in  which could result in the acceleration of all or a portion of these payments due 
the company has a million revolving credit facility the credit facility  which expires in june during  the company intends to begin discussions with its lenders about amending or replacing the credit facility

interest on the notes is payable semi annually on june and december of each year 
the note holders may elect to have these notes repaid on june   at of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest 
the company may seek  from time to time  to retire its outstanding notes through cash purchases on the open market  privately negotiated transactions or otherwise 
such repurchases  if any  will depend on prevailing market conditions  the company s liquidity requirements  contractual restrictions and other factors 
the amounts involved may be material 
significant terms of the company s outstanding debt obligations could have an effect on the company s ability to incur additional debt financing 
the credit facility contains financial covenants which include the ratio of debt to ebitdar as defined in the debt agreement  fixed charge coverage  asset coverage  minimum allowable consolidated net worth and maximum allowable capital expenditures 
the credit facility also places certain specified limitations on secured and unsecured debt 
the company s outstanding notes discussed above place certain specified limitations on secured debt and place certain limitations on the company s ability to execute sale leaseback transactions 
the company has generated significant cash flows from its operations during recent years  and had no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility at any time during t herefore  the company does not believe that any existing limitations on its ability to incur additional indebtedness will have a material impact on its liquidity 
notes and to the consolidated financial statements contain additional disclosures related to the company s debt and financing obligations 
at january  and january   the company had commercial letter of credit facilities totaling million and million  respectively  of which million and million  respectively  were outstanding for the funding of imported merchandise purchases 
the company believes that its existing cash balances million at january   cash flows from operations million generated in  the credit facility million available at january  and its anticipated ongoing access to the capital markets  if necessary  will provide sufficient financing to meet the company s currently foreseeable liquidity and capital resource needs 
cash flows provided by operating activities 
cash flows from operations for compared to increased by million 
in  the company paid million in settlement of the restatement related class action lawsuit  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  which did not recur in partially offsetting this cash outflow were tax benefits totaling approximately million  of which approximately million either directly or indirectly related to the company s financial restatement and subsequent litigation settlement 
the timing of these tax benefits was a significant component of the reduction of cash flows from deferred million and current million income taxes in compared to an increase in accrued liabilities resulted in a million increase in cash flows co mpared to due in part to the accrued sec penalty and increased bonuses described above  increased deferred compensation liabilities and increases in certain tax reserves 
contributing to the increase in cash flows provided by operating activities in was an increase in net income of million driven by the improved operating results discussed above see results of operations 
cash flows from operations for compared to increased by million due principally to the increase in net income described above and improved inventory productivity 
as a result of the improvement in inventory turns to times in from times in  the change in inventory in was an million source of cash as compared against a million use of cash in also affecting cash flows from operating activities was the restatement related class action lawsuit settlement and related tax effects described above

the use of cash in primarily represented the payment of million in dividends 
critical accounting policies and estimates merchandise inventories 
merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined using the retail last in  first out lifo method 
under the retail inventory method rim  the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying a calculated cost to retail ratio to the retail value of inventories 
the rim is an averaging method that has been widely used in the retail industry due to its practicality 
also  it is recognized that the use of the rim will result in valuing inventories at the lower of cost or market if markdowns are currently taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories 
inherent in the rim calculation are certain significant management judgments and estimates including  among others  initial markups  markdowns  and shrinkage  which significantly impact the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as resulting gross margins 
these significant estimates  coupled with the fact that the rim is an averaging process  can  under certain circumstances  produce distorted cost figures 
factors that can lead to distortion in the calculation of the inventory balance include applying the rim to a group of products that is not fairly uniform in terms of its cost and selling price relationship and turnover applying the rim to transactions over a period of time that include different rates of gross profit  such as those relating to seasonal merchandise inaccurate estimates of inventory shrinkage between the date of the last physical inventory at a store and the financial statement date inaccurate estimates of lifo reserves to reduce the potential of such distortions in the valuation of inventory  the company s rim currently utilizes departments in which fairly homogenous classes of merchandise inventories having similar gross margins are grouped 
in the near future  in order to further refine its rim calculation  the company intends to expand the number of departments it utilizes for its gross margin calculation 
the impact of this intended change on the company s future consolidated financial statements cannot currently be estimated 
other factors that reduce potential distortion include the use of historical experience in estimating the shrink provision see discussion below and the utilization of an independent statistician to assist in the lifo sampling process and index formulation 
also  on an ongoing basis  the company reviews and evaluates the salability of its inventory and records adjustments  if necessary  to reflect its inventory at the lower of cost or market 
the company calculates its shrink provision based on actual physical inventory results during the fiscal year and an accrual for estimated shrink occurring subsequent to a physical inventory through the end of the fiscal reporting period 
this accrual is calculated as a percentage of sales and is determined by dividing the sum of all book to physical inventory adjustments recorded during the previous twelve months by the related sales for the same period 
during  in an effort to improve this estimate  the company applied store specific shrink rates to store specific sales generated subsequent to a given store s physical inventory 
in and  the company applied a weighted average shrink rate to all company sales generated subsequent to physical inventories 
to the extent that subsequent physical inventories yield different results than this estimated accrual  the company s shrink rate for a given reporting period will include the impact of adjusting the estimated results to the actual results 
during  the company implemented an item level perpetual inventory system for financial reporting purposes 
this new system provides better information regarding the type of inventory that the company owns and improves the company s ability to estimate its shrink provision 
the utilization of this improved information in the company s rim calculation resulted in a non recurring inventory adjustment of approximately million  which favorably impacted gross margin in the third quarter of property and equipment 
property and equipment are recorded at cost 
the company groups its assets into relatively homogeneous classes and provides for depreciation on a straight line basis over the estimated average useful life of each asset class 
the valuation and classification of these assets and the assignment of useful depreciable lives involves significant judgments and the use of estimates 
property and equipment are reviewed for impairment periodically and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
self insurance liability 
the company retains a significant portion of the risk for its workers compensation  employee health insurance  general liability  property loss and automobile coverage 
these costs are significant primarily due to the large employee base and number of stores 
provisions are made to this insurance liability on an undiscounted basis based on actual claim data and estimates of incurred but not reported claims developed by independent actuaries utilizing historical claim trends 
if future claim trends deviate from recent historical patterns  the company may be required to record additional expenses or expense reductions which could be material to the company s future financial results 
contingent liabilities income taxes 
the company is subject to routine income tax audits which occur periodically in the normal course of business 
the company estimates its contingent income tax liabilities based on its assessment of potential income tax related exposures and the relative probabilities of those exposures translating into actual future liabilities 
the probabilities are estimated based on both historical audit experiences with various state and federal taxing authorities and the company s interpretation of current income tax related trends 
if the company s income tax contingent liability estimates prove to be inaccurate  the resulting adjustments could be material to the company s future financial results

the eitf concluded that such consideration received from vendors should be reflected as a decrease in prices paid for inventory and recognized in cost of sales as the related inventory is sold  unless specific criteria are met qualifying the consideration for treatment as reimbursement of specific  identifiable incremental costs 
as clarified by the eitf in january  this issue was effective for arrangements with vendors initiated on or after january  the provisions of this consensus have been applied prospectively and are consistent with the company s existing accounting policy 
accordingly  the adoption of eitf did not have a material impact on the company s financial statements as a whole

the company believes the assumptions underlying these forward looking statements are reasonable  however  any of the assumptions could be inaccurate  and therefore  actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
the factors and risks that may result in actual results differing from such forward looking information include  but are not limited to the company s reputation and financial condition could be affected by the sec investigation 
as previously disclosed in the company s periodic reports filed with the sec  the company restated its audited financial statements for fiscal years and  and certain unaudited financial information for fiscal year  by means of its form k for the fiscal year ended february   which was filed on january  the sec has been conducting an investigation into the circumstances giving rise to the restatement and  on january   the company received notice that the sec staff was considering recommending that the sec bring a civil injunctive action against the company for alleged violations of the federal securities laws in connection with circumstances relating to the restatement 
the company subsequently has reached an agreement in principle with the sec staff to settle the matter 
under the terms of the agreement in principle  the company will consent  without admitting or denying the allegations in a complaint to be filed by the sec  to the entry of a permanent civil injunction against future violations of the antifraud  books and records  reporting and internal control provisions of the federal securities laws and related sec rules and will pay a millio n nondeductible civil penalty 
the agreement with the sec staff is subject to final approval by the sec and the court in which the sec s complaint is filed 
the company has accrued million with respect to the penalty in its financial statements for the year ended january  the company can give no assurances that the sec or the court will approve this agreement 
if the agreement is not approved  the company could be subject to different or additional penalties  both monetary and non monetary  which could adversely affect the company s financial statements as a whole 
the publicity surrounding the sec investigation and settlement also could affect the company s reputation and have an adverse impact on its financial statements as a whole 
the company s business is modestly seasonal with the highest sales occurring during the fourth quarter 
adverse events during the fourth quarter could  therefore  affect the company s financial statements as a whole 
the company realizes a larger portion of its net sales and net income during the christmas selling season 
in anticipation of the holidays  the company purchases substantial amounts of seasonal inventory and hires many temporary employees 
if for any reason the company s net sales during the christmas selling season were to fall below seasonal norms  a seasonal merchandise inventory imbalance could result 
if such an imbalance were to occur  markdowns might be required to minimize this imbalance 
the company s profitability and operating results could be adversely affected by unbudgeted markdowns 
nb sp  adverse weather conditions or other disruptions  especially during the peak christmas season but also at other times  could also adversely affect the company s net sales and could make it more difficult for the company to obtain sufficient quantities of merchandise from its suppliers 
competition in the retail industry could limit the company s growth opportunities and reduce its profitability 
the company competes in the discount retail merchandise business  which is highly competitive 
this competitive environment subjects the company to the risk of reduced profitability resulting from reduced margins required to maintain the company s competitive position 
the company competes with discount stores and with many other retailers  including mass merchandise  grocery  drug  convenience  variety and other specialty stores 
some of the nation s largest retail companies operate stores in areas where the company operates 
the company s direct competitors in the dollar store retail category include family dollar  dollar tree  fred s  and various local  independent operators 
competitors fr om other retail categories include cvs  rite aid  walgreens  eckerd  wal mart and kmart 
the discount retail merchandise business is subject to excess capacity and some of the company s competitors are much larger and have substantially greater resources than the company 
the competition for customers has intensified in recent years as larger competitors  such as wal mart  have moved into the company s geographic markets 
the company remains vulnerable to the marketing power and high level of consumer recognition of these major national discount chains  and to the risk that these chains or others could venture into the dollar store industry in a significant way 
generally  the company expects an increase in competition 
the company s financial performance is sensitive to changes in overall economic conditions that may impact consumer spending 
a general slowdown in the united states economy may adversely affect the spending of the company s consumers  which would likely result in lower net sales than expected on a quarterly or annual basis 
future economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income  such as employment levels  business conditions  fuel and energy costs  interest rates  and tax rates  could also adversely affect the company s business by reducing consumer spending or causing consumers to shift their spending to other products 
existing military efforts and the possibility of war  acts of terrorism and rising fuel costs could adversely impact the company 
existing us military efforts  as well as the involvement of the united states in a war in the middle east or elsewhere  or a significant act of terrorism on us soil or elsewhere  could have an adverse impact on the company by  among other things  disrupting its information or distribution systems  causing dramatic increases in fuel prices thereby increasing the costs of doing business  or impeding the flow of imports or domestic products to the company 
the company s business is dependent on its ability to obtain attractive pricing and other terms from its vendors and to timely receive inventory 
the company believes that it has generally good relations with its vendors and that it is generally able to obtain attractive pricing and other terms from vendors 
if the company fails to maintain good relations with its vendors  it may not be able to obtain attractive pricing with the consequence that its net sales or profit margins would be reduced 
the company may also face difficulty in obtaining needed inventory from its vendors because of interruptions in production or for other reasons  which would adversely affect the company s business 
the efficient operation of the company s business is heavily dependent on its information systems 
the company depends on a variety of information technology systems for the efficient functioning of its business 
the company relies on certain software vendors to maintain and periodically upgrade many of these systems so that they can continue to support the company s business 
the software programs supporting many of the company s systems were licensed to the company by independent software developers 
the inability of these developers or the company to continue to maintain and upgrade these information systems and software programs would disrupt or reduce the efficiency of the company s operations if it were unable to convert to alternate systems in an efficient and timely manner 
in addition  costs and potential probl ems and interruptions associated with the implementation of new or upgraded systems and technology could also disrupt or reduce the efficiency of the company s operations 
the company is subject to interest rate risk 
the company is subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on its financing  investing and cash management activities 
the company may utilize its credit facility to fund working capital requirements  which is comprised of variable rate debt 
see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
the company is dependent upon the smooth functioning of its distribution network and upon the capacity of its dcs 
the company relies upon the ability to replenish depleted inventory through deliveries to its dcs from vendors  and from the dcs to its stores by various means of transportation  including shipments by air  sea and truck on the roads and highways of the united states 
the driver hours of service regulations adopted by the federal motor carriers safety administration  which became effective january   could negatively impact transportation costs 
in addition  long term disruptions to the national and international transportation infrastructure that lead to delays or interruptions of service would adversely affect the company s business 
similarly  delays in or interruptions in or caused by the expansion o f dcs or the conversions of dcs to dual sortation would adversely affect the company s business 
moreover  to facilitate its expected growth  the company will need additional dcs in the coming years 
if the company were unable to locate sites for the new dcs or were unable to achieve functionality of the new dcs in the time frame expected  the company s ability to achieve the expected growth could be inhibited 
construction and expansion projects relating to the company s dcs entail risks which could cause delays and cost overruns  such as shortages of materials  shortages of skilled labor or work stoppages  unforeseen construction scheduling  engineering  environmental or geological problems  weather interference  fires or other casualty losses  and unanticipated cost increases 
the completion dates and anticipated costs of these projects could differ significantly from initial expectations for construction related or other reasons 
the company cannot guarantee that any project will be completed on time or within established budgets 
the company s success depends to a significant extent upon the abilities of its senior management team and the performance of its employees 
the loss of services of key members of the company s senior management team or of certain other key employees could negatively impact the company s business 
in addition  future performance will depend upon the company s ability to attract  retain and motivate qualified employees to keep pace with its expansion schedule 
the inability to do so may limit the company s ability to effectively penetrate new market areas 
also  the company experienced several senior management changes in significant difficulties in transitioning under new management could negatively impact the company s business 
if the company cannot open new stores on schedule  its growth will be impeded 
delays in store openings could adversely affect the company s future operations by slowing new store growth  which may in turn reduce its revenue growth 
the company s ability to timely open new stores and to expand into additional states will depend in part on the following factors the availability of attractive store locations  the ability to negotiate favorable lease terms  the ability to hire and train new personnel  especially store managers  the ability to identify customer demand in different geographic areas  general economic conditions  and the availability of sufficient funds for expansion 
many of these factors are beyond the company s control 
the inability to execute operating initiatives could impact the company s operating results 
the company is undertaking a significant number of operating initiatives in that have the potential to be disruptive in the short term if they are not implemented effectively 
ineffective implementation or execution of some or all of these initiatives could negatively impact the company s operating results 
rising insurance costs could negatively impact profitability 
the costs of insurance workers compensation insurance  general liability insurance  health insurance  property insurance and directors and officers liability insurance have risen in recent years 
if such increases continue  they could have a negative impact on the company s profitability

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial risk management the company is exposed to market risk primarily from adverse changes in interest rates 
to minimize such risk  the company may periodically use financial instruments  including derivatives 
as a matter of policy  the company does not buy or sell financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes and all financial instrument transactions must be authorized and executed pursuant to board of directors approval 
all financial instrument positions taken by the company are used to reduce risk by hedging an underlying economic exposure 
because of high correlation between the financial instrument and the underlying exposure being hedged  fluctuations in the value of the financial instruments are generally offset by reciprocal changes in the value of the underlying economic exposure 
the financial instruments used by the company are straight forward instruments with liquid markets 
the company has cash flow exposure relating to variable interest rates associated with its revolving line of credit  and may periodically seek to manage this risk through the use of interest rate derivatives 
the primary interest rate exposure on variable rate obligations is based on the london interbank offered rate libor 
at january  and january   the fair value of the company s debt  excluding capital lease obligations  was estimated at approximately million net of the fair value of a note receivable on the south boston  virginia dc of million  as further discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements and million  respectively  based on the estimated market value of the debt at those dates 
such fair value was greater than the carrying value of the debt at january  by approximately million and less than the carrying value of the debt at january   by approximately million 
at february   the company was party to an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of million 
the company designated this agreement as a hedge of its floating rate commitments relating to a portion of certain synthetic lease agreements that existed at that time 
under the terms of the agreement  the company paid a fixed rate of and received a floating rate libor on the million notional amount through september  the fair value of the interest rate swap agreement was million at february  the counterparty to the company s interest rate swap agreement was a major financial institution 
the interest rate swap agreement expired on september  as of january   the company was not party to any interest rate derivatives 
in and  as required by sfas no 
 the company recorded the fair value of the interest rate swap in the balance sheet  with the offsetting  effective portion of the change in fair value recorded in other comprehensive loss  a separate component of shareholders equity in the consolidated financial statements 
amounts recorded in other comprehensive loss were reclassified into earnings  as an adjustment to interest expense  in the same period during which the hedged synthetic lease agreements affected earnings 
based upon the company s variable rate borrowing levels  a adverse change in interest rates would have resulted in a pre tax reduction of earnings and cash flows of approximately million  including the effects of interest rate swaps  in in  the company had no outstanding variable rate borrowings 
based upon the company s outstanding indebtedness at january  and january   a reduction in interest rates would have resulted in an increase in the fair value of the company s fixed rate debt of approximately million and million  respectively
