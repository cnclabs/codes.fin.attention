item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we develop and market healthcare connectivity software centered around the carepoint suite of healthcare communication technology products for electronic prescribing  laboratory orders and results  internet based communication  data integration and transaction processing through a handheld device or browser  at the patient point of care 
our products enable communication of healthcare information among physicians offices  pharmacies  hospitals  pharmacy benefit managers  health management organizations  pharmaceutical companies and health insurance companies 
our technology is designed to provide access to safer  better healthcare and more accurate and less expensive poc information gathering and processing 
in expanding our services for medical professionals  in november  we acquired the business and assets of frontline which provides telephone answering services to physicians and other medically related businesses and answering and other virtual office services to non medical businesses and professionals 
we are currently exploring the feasibility of using liferamp to commence a new business  making non recourse loans to terminally ill cancer patients secured by their life insurance policies 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies and items affecting comparability quality financial reporting relies on consistent application of our accounting policies that are based on accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical to understanding our financial statements and often require management judgment and estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from service contracts relating to frontline as services are performed  provided that the following revenue recognition criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 
service is provided 
the fee is fixed or determinable 
collectibility is probable 
we recognize revenue related to sales of technology and related agreements only when we have completed all of our obligations and are entitled to payment from the customer 
at our stage of development  we have just started to realize recurring revenues from the sale of our technology 
we signed an agreement with a client providing for  of sign up fees and possible additional revenues in connection with the introduction of our e prescribing software to physicians who are customers of the client 
we are recognizing the sign up fees ratably during the period in which we expect to introduce the software to physicians 
additional revenue may be earned by us b ased on the extent of the future use of our software by the physicians 
additional revenue will not be recognized until it is earned and due under the terms of the agreement 
technological feasability for our software is reached shortly before the products are released commercially 
costs incurred after technological feasibility is established are not material  and  accordingly  we expense all software and technology costs when incurred 
goodwill goodwill represent acquisition costs in excess of the fair value of net tangible assets of businesses purchased 
in conjunction with our adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  we evaluate our goodwill annually for impairment  or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist 
the determination of whether or not goodwill or other intangible assets have become impaired involves a significant level of judgment in the assumptions underlying the approach used to determine the value of the reporting units 
changes in our strategy and or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require adjustments to recorded amounts of intangible assets 
we will continue to evaluate our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or sooner if indicators of potential impairment exist 
long lived assets with the exception of goodwill  long lived assets  such as property and equipment and other intangible assets  net  are evaluated for impairment when events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of these assets and their eventual disposition is less than their carrying amount 
impairment  if any  is assessed using discounted cash flows 
during the year ended december   no such impairment losses were recognized 
contingencies we are subject to legal proceedings  lawsuits and other claims related to labor  service and other matters 
we are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these contingencies are made after careful analysis of each individual issue 
the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach  such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters 
equity transactions in many of our financing transactions  warrants have been issued 
additionally  we issue options and warrants to non employees from time to time as payment for services 
in all of these cases  we apply the principles of sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation to value these awards  which inherently include a number of estimates and assumptions including stock price volatility factors 
we based our estimates and assumptions on the best information available at the time of valuation  however  changes in these estimates and assumptions could have a material effect on the valuation of the underlying instruments

software and technology costs of  were incurred in  an increase of  compared to  for the increase is primarily related to the write off of  of previously capitalized net software development costs for which recoverability became uncertain due to uncertainty in future cash flows 
the increase also reflects additional license costs incurred in of  over due to added infrastructure to support our transaction service capabilities in as we placed a major focus on deployment of our technologies with pbms during the first three quarters of amortization of capitalized software development costs in creased  while research and development costs decreased by  selling  general and administrative expenses increased  or from  in to  in the increase is primarily attributable to  of leasehold abandonment costs incurred in due to the closure of our california and georgia offices  offset by a reduction in outside consulting fees

these losses have produced operating cash flow deficiencies  and negative working capital  which raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern 
the company s future operations are dependent upon management s ability to source additional equity capital 
the company expects to continue to experience losses in the near term  until such time that its technologies can be successfully deployed with physicians to produce revenues 
the continuing deployment  marketing and the development of the merged technologies will depend on the company s ability to obtain additional financing 
the company has not generated any significant revenue to date from this technology 
the company is currently funding operations through the sale of common stock  and there are no assurances that additional investments or financings will be available as needed to support the development and deployment of the merged technologies

effective january   the company adopted the recognition and measurement provisions of fasb interpretation no 
guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
the interpretation expands on the accounting guidance of statements no 
  and and incorporates without change the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 which is being superseded 
the interpretation elaborates on the existing disclosure requirements for most guarantees  including loan guarantees such as standby letters of credit 
it also clarifies that at the time a company issues a guarantee  that compa ny must recognize an initial liability for the fair value  or market value  of the obligations it assumes under that guarantee and must disclose that information in its interim and annual financial statements 
the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions apply on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december   regardless of the guarantor s fiscal year end 
the company does not currently provide significant guarantees
