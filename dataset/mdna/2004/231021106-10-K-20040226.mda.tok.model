overview cummins is a global power leader comprised of four reportable complementary business segments engine  power generation  filtration and other  and international distributors 
our businesses design  manufacture  distribute and service diesel and natural gas engines and related technologies  including fuel systems  controls  air handling and filtration  emissions solutions and electrical power generation systems 
our products are sold to original equipment manufacturers oems  distributors and other customers worldwide 
major oem customers include daimlerchrysler  paccar  international truck and engine corporation navistar  volvo  komatsu  ford  volkswagen  and cnh global 
we serve our customers through more than company owned and independent distributor locations in countries and territories 
our business units share technology  customers  strategic partners  brands and our distribution network 
our financial performance is affected by the cyclical nature and varying conditions of the markets we serve  particularly the automotive  construction and general industrial markets 
demand in these markets fluctuates in response to overall economic conditions and is particularly sensitive to changes in the price of crude oil fuel costs  freight tonnage  interest rate levels  non residential construction spending and general industrial capital spending 
economic downturns in the markets we serve generally result in reductions in sales and pricing of our products and reduce our earnings and cash flow 
since  our north american markets have experienced a downturn  most notably in the heavy duty trucks  medium duty trucks and construction equipment markets 
these conditions have adversely impacted the performance of our engine business 
in addition  weak conditions in the standby back up power generation markets  resulting in decreased demand and high inventory levels  have also had a negative impact on the performance of our power generation business 
many of the markets in which the engine business operates are highly competitive 
our products compete worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell similar products primarily on the basis of price  performance  fuel economy  reliability  delivery  quality and customer service and support 
some of our competitors are companies  or operating units or divisions of companies that have consolidated with other companies and have become powertrain integrated 
for example  two of the world s largest truck manufacturers have made recent acquisitions that increase their engine making capacity in north america daimlerchrysler acquired detroit diesel and volvo acquired mack trucks  inc other competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do 
as a result  our competitive position within the heavy duty truck market has weakened over the last decade due to market share losses and the changing dynamics of the industry 
in response to these conditions  we have entered into separate long term supply agreements with navistar  paccar and volvo to provide long term  stable pricing for our engines and eliminate certain dealer and end user discounts 
these agreements also provide for closer integration of product design  testing and development 
in addition  we reduced our heavy duty engine manufacturing capacity by consolidating our heavy duty engine assembly and test operations at our jamestown  new york facility 
we expect stable pricing from the long term agreements  our heavy duty engine assembly consolidation  savings from six sigma projects and previous restructuring actions to improve our profitability in this market without being dependent upon a material gain in market share 
in  our first quarter performance was impacted by the significant pre buy of existing engine models that occurred ahead of the october   emissions rule changes and the overall weak freight environment 
by the second half of the year  the truck tonnage index was increasing and most of our markets were beginning to recover as general economic conditions improved and all of our business segments returned to profitability 
earlier this year we celebrated the shipment of our  th liter diesel engine for the dodge ram truck  which is manufactured at our walesboro  in  facility  highlighting years of partnership with the chrysler group of daimlerchrysler 
in october  we extended our exclusive supply agreement with the chrysler group for diesel engines used in the dodge ram truck and in december  ward s communications  a leading provider of automotive industry news  data and analysis named the cummins liter engine for the dodge ram truck as one of the best engines for in october  we announced that our isb engine will become available in thomas built buses beginning in january thomas built buses  a leading manufacturer of school buses in north america and a member of the daimlerchrysler freightliner group  is the first school bus manufacturer to offer the new emissions compliant isb engine 
the isb was selected because of its quiet operation and low operating costs 
our performance in the power generation business was adversely affected by excess inventory in the market coupled with extreme pricing pressure and low volumes  but was partially offset by improved sales of our mobile generator sets to the recreational vehicle market 
in august  our power generation business and our cummins distributor network responded to emergency power needs resulting from the blackout that affected much of the northeast region of the us and parts of canada 
during the height of this crisis  which helped absorb some of the industry capacity  we had more than megawatts of rental power operating in the northeast region 
our filtration and other business performed well in with sales exceeding billion  including strong sales growth from our new fleetguard emissions solutions business 
in  fleetguard signed multiple long term supply agreements with major oems and opened a new  square foot manufacturing facility in waynesboro  georgia to support the growing small engine and recreational vehicle exhaust market in the southeastern us net sales and earnings of our joint ventures and alliances increased significantly during  primarily from the expansion of our joint venture in china  dongfeng cummins engine company 
this joint venture  which is a supplier to china s second largest truck manufacturer  now has access to the most advanced full electronic diesel engine platforms that cummins provides 
in december  we announced that we will meet the us epa heavy duty on highway emissions standards by combining our existing cooled exhaust gas recirculation egr technology with particulate matter pm filters 
cooled egr is the same technology that we have used since april  and was selected after reviewing other aftertreatment technologies such as nox adsorbers and selective catalytic reduction scr 
our experience with particulate filters and the availability of ultra low sulfur diesel fuel combine to give us the confidence in meeting these tough standards in the us additionally  while the egr pm filter combination is the right solution for in the us  we have selected scr as the right technology to meet on highway euro iv emissions standards and certain off highway applications 
results of operations our net earnings were million  or per share  on sales of billion in compared to net earnings of million  or per share  on sales of billion in net earnings in included a fourth quarter after tax charge of million  or 
per share  for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle resulting from the consolidation of a variable interest entity 
a majority of our earnings were delivered in the fourth quarter  as business conditions and our profitability improved significantly in the second half of the year 
fourth quarter net earnings were million in  or per share  compared to net earnings of million  or per share  in the fourth quarter of our earnings from joint ventures and alliances were a record million in the fourth quarter of  compared to million in the fourth quarter of net earnings in include a pre tax credit of million for costs associated with restructuring actions  an million pre tax charge related to early extinguishment of debt and a million after tax credit for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
net earnings in also reflected a one time million favorable tax adjustment related to the settlement of income tax audits for the years through in  we incurred a net loss of million  or per share  including a net after tax charge of million related to restructuring actions 
net sales the table below sets forth net sales for each of our key business segments during the last three years millions engine    power generation    filtration and other  international distributor elimination of intersegment sales sales increased in all of our business segments in compared to  with a majority of the increase occurring in the second half of the year as economic conditions strengthened 
sales of our engine business increased million  or percent  primarily from higher sales to the chrysler group for the dodge ram truck 
power generation sales increased million  or percent  compared to the prior year  buoyed by strong fourth quarter demand 
sales in the filtration and other business reached the billion level  up million  or percent year over year  reflecting demand improvement and increased market penetration 
sales in our international distributor business increased million  or percent  compared to  primarily from strong engine and parts sales at our distributorships in australia  dubai and south africa 
net sales for were billion  an increase of million  or percent  compared to net sales in a majority of the increase was attributable to our engine business  which experienced a strong pre buy of on highway heavy duty engines in advance of the october   epa emissions deadline and higher sales of midrange engines for the dodge ram truck 
gross margin our gross margin was billion in  billion in and billion in  with related gross margin percentages of percent  percent and percent  respectively 
compared to  our gross margin percentage was relatively flat on a net sales increase of million 
our gross margin on the new emissions compliant engine models was essentially flat compared to the pre emission engines  as the effect of a pricing increase on the new engine models was offset by incremental costs of new parts and components and higher product coverage costs 
however  our gross margin percentage appears lower as the gross margin dollar amount is now measured against a higher sales value due to the pricing action 
product coverage costs as a percentage of total net sales were flat year over year at percent in and in  our gross margin was billion compared to billion in with related gross margin percentages of percent and percent  respectively 
gross margin in was relatively flat compared to on a net sales increase of million  reflecting changes in sales mix as we transitioned from mature engines to new engines in the latter half of the year 
margins on our new engine models are typically lower at introduction compared to mature engines 
in addition  gross margin was also affected by lower fixed cost absorption in our power generation business due to a significant sales decline as a result of weak power generation demand 
product coverage costs were flat year over year at percent of total net sales in and selling and administrative expenses total selling and administrative expenses were million percent of net sales in compared to million percent of net sales in included in the increase is million from the impact of foreign exchange rate changes at our foreign entities 
of the total increase  approximately million was related to selling expenses and million to administrative expenses 
the increase in selling expense is primarily attributable to higher compensation expense from incremental sales staffing million  funding of growth initiatives including outside consulting services million  increases in fringe expenses including pensions million  increases in variable incentive compensation due to higher segment earnings million and other volume variable expenses that individually are not material 
the increase in administrative expenses resulted from higher fringe benefit expenses  primarily pensions million  increases in audit and non audit services  primarily resulting from a reaudit of the and consolidated financial statements million  increases in legal fees million  higher salaries and wages from staffing increases million  and other miscellaneous items that individually are not material 
selling and administrative expenses were million in  an increase of million  or percent  compared to million percent of net sales in the increase in selling and administrative expenses year over year is primarily a result of volume variable expenditures  funding of focused growth initiatives and higher variable compensation expense due to improved earnings  partially offset by cost reduction actions 
research and engineering expenses research and engineering expenses were million percent of net sales in compared to million percent of net sales in  or a decrease of million 
year over year salary and wages were lower million as spending was reduced on heavy duty development work following the launch of our new emissions compliant engines introduced in million  and from decreased expenses related to development costs of our european engine alliance joint venture million 
this reduction in spending was partially offset by increased development work and testing on euro emissions and on tier ii and iii industrial emissions engines million  increased fringe expenses  primarily pension expense million and other expenses that individually were not material 
research and engineering expenses in were million  a decrease of million  or percent  compared to million percent of net sales in overall  research and engineering expenses were lower due to the cancellation of a major engine development program in the second quarter of and other productivity improvement and cost reduction actions  partially offset by higher engineering costs related to the development of our emissions products 
equity  royalty and other income from investees earnings from our joint ventures and alliances were million in compared to million in  an increase of million 
the year over year increase was attributable to improved earnings across most of our joint ventures  primarily dongfeng cummins engine company ltd 
million  our north american distributor joint ventures million  the european engine alliance million  chongqing cummins engine company ltd 
million  our joint ventures in india  primarily tata holset and tata cummins ltd 
million and our marine joint venture  cummins mercruiser million 
royalty income from joint ventures and alliances increased million in compared to in april  dongfeng automobile company ltd  which is a manufacturing licensee of our b series engine and a subsidiary of dongfeng motor company  china s second largest truck manufacturer  and our wholly owned subsidiary cummins xiangfan machining company ltd  a manufacturer of b series cylinder blocks and cylinder heads were integrated into the existing cummins and dongfeng joint venture  dongfeng cummins engine company ltd 
the expanded joint venture  with a capacity in excess of  units  produces cummins b  c and l series four to nine liter mechanical and full electronic diesel engines with a power range from to horsepower 
the increase in earnings reflects improvements in efficiency and lower production costs as a result of the integration 
in  our income from joint ventures and alliances was million  compared to million of income in the increase was a result of improved earnings across most of our joint ventures  particularly our joint ventures in china  earnings at our partially owned distributor locations in north america and our marine joint venture with mercury marine  a division of brunswick corporation  cummins mercruiser diesel 
restructuring  asset impairment and other charges through the end of  we continued a restructuring program initiated in to improve our cost structure 
the charges related to this program included staffing reorganizations and reductions in various business segments  asset impairment write downs for manufacturing equipment  facility closure and consolidation costs  dissolution costs and restructuring actions related to joint venture operations  cancellation of a new engine development program and exit costs related to several small business operations 
our results include a net million credit related to restructuring actions comprised of a net million charge in the second quarter and a million reversal of excess accruals in the fourth quarter 
the net million charge in the second quarter included million for restructuring actions recognized in that quarter  offset by a reversal of million of excess accruals 
the reversal of excess accruals in the second and fourth quarters was primarily a result of and restructuring actions that were realigned or cancelled 
in  we recorded a net restructuring and other charge of million related to the downturn in the north american heavy duty truck market and several other end markets 
this action was necessary to achieve lower production costs and improve operating efficiencies under difficult economic conditions 
the charge included staffing reorganizations and reductions in various business segments  asset impairment write downs for manufacturing equipment  cancellation of a new engine development program  facility closure and consolidation costs and other exit costs related to small business operations 
note of the consolidated financial statements includes schedules that present by major cost component and by year of expense  activities related to restructuring actions for the years through  including adjustments to the original charges 
all activities associated with our and restructuring actions were completed as of december  and december   respectively 
a discussion of our restructuring actions during this period follows 
restructuring actions in the second quarter of  we announced further restructuring actions precipitated by weak market conditions  related primarily to our engine and power generation businesses  and recorded additional restructuring charges of million 
the charges included million attributable to workforce reduction actions  million for asset impairments and million related to facility closures and consolidations 
of this charge  million was associated with our engine business  million with power generation  million with filtration and other and million with the international distributor business 
the charges included severance costs and related benefits of terminating approximately salaried and hourly employees and were based on amounts pursuant to established benefit programs or statutory requirements of the affected operations 
these actions reflect overall reductions in staffing levels due to closing operations and moving production to available capacity 
the asset impairment charge related to equipment available for disposal 
the carrying value of the equipment and the effect of suspending depreciation on the equipment were not significant 
in the fourth quarter of  the number and mix of employees terminated under this plan differed from our original estimate 
as a result  approximately million of excess accruals related to severance costs and related benefits were reversed 
as of december   approximately salaried and hourly employees had been separated or terminated under this plan 
this restructuring action was completed as of december  and approximately million in liabilities related to this action were paid in restructuring actions in the first half of  we announced further restructuring actions as a result of the continuing downturn in the north american heavy duty truck market and several other end markets and recorded restructuring charges of million  most of which was recorded in the second quarter 
the charges included million for workforce reduction actions  million for asset impairment and million related to cancellation of purchase commitments for capital and tooling equipment 
in addition  we recorded a million charge related to the divestiture of a small business operation 
these charges were reduced by a million reversal of excess accruals recorded in our restructuring action 
of the net million charge  million was associated with the engine business  million with the power generation business  million with the filtration and other business and million with the international distributor business 
the workforce reduction actions included overall reductions in staffing levels and the impact of divesting a small business operation 
the charges included severance costs and related benefits of terminating approximately salaried and hourly employees and were based on amounts pursuant to established benefit programs or statutory requirements of the affected operations 
all employees affected by this workforce reduction plan and the subsequent fourth quarter realignment plan were terminated by the end of the fourth quarter of the asset impairment charge and the charges for cancelled purchased commitments were related to an investment supporting a new engine development program that was cancelled in the second quarter of the charges included the cost of manufacturing equipment previously capitalized and cancellation charges for capital and tooling purchase commitments 
the charge was reduced by the estimated salvage value related to the planned equipment disposals 
during  we recovered million of salvage proceeds on planned equipment disposals 
in addition  we reversed million of the original restructuring accrual as we settled our equipment commitments for less than our original estimate 
in the fourth quarter  we transferred million of previously impaired manufacturing equipment to another plant as a result of a subsequent decision to consolidate our isx assembly and test operations and realigned our workforce reduction plan 
these actions resulted in the reversal of an additional million in excess charges related to this plan 
this restructuring action was completed as of december  and approximately salaried and hourly employees were separated or terminated under the workforce reduction actions of this plan 
interest expense interest expense was million in compared to million in most of the increase resulted from higher debt levels million and borrowing rates million of our senior notes issued in november  and the required presentation of dividends on our preferred securities as interest expense million effective july   in accordance with a new accounting standard see note recently adopted accounting pronouncements 
previously  the dividends on our preferred securities were classified separately in our consolidated statements of earnings 
the preferred securities are now classified as long term debt in our consolidated statements of financial position and were previously classified in our consolidated statements of financial position between long term debt and shareholder s equity 
interest expense was million in compared to million in  a decrease of million 
a majority of the decrease is a result of lower borrowings due to the issuance of our preferred securities in and lower interest rates on borrowings 
the amount of interest expense paid in  and was million  million and million  respectively 
loss on early retirement of debt in november  we elected to repay all of the outstanding notes issued by our employee stock ownership plan esop trust 
these notes would have matured in the election to repay the notes early was a result of a covenant conflict with our revolving credit facility that was entered into in november the aggregate repayment of the notes was approximately million  plus an million premium for early repayment and approximately million of accrued interest 
the million premium for early repayment of the notes has been classified in our consolidated statements of earnings as loss on early retirement of debt 
see note of the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to this transaction 
other income and expense other income and expense was a net million of income in compared to a net million of income in  or a million increase 
most of the increase is attributable to losses from foreign currency exchange transactions in million  primarily the uk pound sterling  brazilian real and the argentine peso 
in  other income and expense was a net million of income compared to net amount of million in a majority of the increase is a result of the discontinuance of goodwill amortization in accordance with a newly adopted accounting standard see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
other income and expense includes several transactions comprising foreign currency exchange  interest income and other miscellaneous items 
the major components of other income and expense  segregated between operating items and non operating items  are disclosed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
provision for income taxes our income tax provision in was million compared to income tax benefits of million in and million in the income tax benefit included a one time  million favorable tax adjustment credit related to the settlement of us internal revenue service income tax audits for tax years through our effective income tax rate for all years through was lower than the percent us corporate income tax rate because of reduced taxes on export sales  research tax credits and dividends on preferred securities  which are tax deductible as interest expense 
we expect our effective tax rate to be higher than the effective tax rate  but still below the percent us corporate income tax rate 
the effective tax rates were percent for restructuring credits and percent for the loss on early retirement of debt 
the effective tax rate in was percent for restructuring charges 
the amount of income taxes paid in  and was million  million and million  respectively 
please refer to note of the consolidated financial statements for a more complete disclosure of our income taxes including a reconciliation of the income tax provision benefit that would be expected using the percent us federal income tax rate to the actual income tax provision benefit recorded 
minority interests in earnings of consolidated subsidiaries minority interests in our consolidated operations were million in compared to million in and million in the decrease in compared to is a result of lower earnings at cummins india limited  a percent owned subsidiary  and wuxi holset ltd  a percent owned subsidiary  partially offset by income from our percent owned subsidiary in brazil  cummins powerent comericio e loca o  ltda 
the increase in minority interests over is primarily from higher earnings in the operating results of cummins india limited and wuxi holset ltd 
dividends on preferred securities dividends on our preferred securities were million in compared to million in and million in we issued our preferred securities in june through a wholly owned subsidiary and accordingly  results in included dividend payments for only the last two quarters 
in  results included four quarters of dividend payments  while results included dividend payments for only the first two quarters due to the adoption of a new accounting standard 
effective july   dividends on our preferred securities were prospectively classified as interest expense in our consolidated statements of earnings in accordance with this new standard see note recently adopted accounting pronouncements 
a description of our obligation relating to these preferred securities is provided in note  convertible preferred securities of subsidiary trust of our consolidated financial statements 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principles consolidation of a variable interest entity as disclosed in our third quarter form q  we have subsequently evaluated the impact of adopting fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin  as it relates to a sale leaseback transaction entered into in with a variable interest entity vie 
under the provisions of fin  we determined that we are the primary beneficiary of the vie due to a residual value guarantee obligation at the end of the lease term 
accordingly  we have recorded the cumulative effect of consolidating the vie into our consolidated financial statements as a change in accounting principle as of december  the cumulative effect of the change was a million charge million after tax  or per share and represents the reversal of the original sale leaseback transaction as if it had not occurred  and the consolidation of the vie from the inception of the lease 
the effect of consolidating the vie into our consolidated statements of financial position was to increase property  plant and equipment by a net million its current carrying value as if it had been depreciated since the lease inception and a net increase in long term debt  other liabilities and minority interests by million 
this transaction is discussed in note of the consolidated financial statements and a description of our leasing transactions is provided in note the consolidation of the vie had no impact on our consolidated statements of earnings other than the reported cumulative effect at december  change in pension measurement date during the fourth quarter of  we changed the measurement date for measuring the investment return on assets invested in our pension plans and our minimum liability for pension plan obligations from september to november this change in measurement date aligns more closely with our fiscal year end  and we believe provides a more current measurement of plan obligations and investment return on plan assets than previously presented 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  we have reported this change in our consolidated statements of earnings as a change in accounting principle 
the cumulative after tax effect of the change was a million increase in earnings  or per share  and was recorded as of january  see note of the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of this change 
net earnings loss net earnings in were million  or per share  compared to net earnings of million or per share in and a net loss of million  or  per share in net earnings in included a net after tax charge of million for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle resulting from the consolidation of a financing variable interest entity 
net earnings in included a one time million favorable tax adjustment related to the settlement of income tax audits for the years through  a pre tax credit of million for costs associated with restructuring actions  a pre tax charge of million related to early retirement of debt and a million after tax credit for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for pensions 
absent the effects of the one time tax adjustment  the restructuring credit and the charge for early retirement of debt  our performance in improved over primarily due to higher sales volume and the resulting margin and higher earnings at our joint ventures  partially offset by increased selling and administrative expenses and higher interest expense 
net earnings for included a net after tax charge of million related to restructuring actions 
excluding the effects of the one time tax adjustment  restructuring credits  loss on early retirement of debt  and the cumulative effect of an accounting principle change  a majority of the increase in net earnings compared to net earnings is attributable to higher sales volume and improved overhead absorption at our manufacturing plants  earnings improvement in our filtration and other business  improved earnings at our joint ventures and alliances and the discontinuance of goodwill amortization  partially offset by losses in our power generation business 
business segment results we have four reportable business segments engine  power generation  filtration and other and international distributors 
this reporting structure is organized according to the products and markets each segment serves and allows management to focus its efforts on providing enhanced service to a wide range of customers 
we evaluate the performance of each of our business segments based on earnings before interest  taxes  minority interests  and cumulative effect of accounting changes segment ebit and return on average net assets excluding debt  taxes and minimum pension liability adjustment 
prior to january   inter segment transactions between the engine segment and the power generation segment and between the filtration and other segment and the engine segment have been reported as a transfer at cost and no sale reported by the transferor segment 
beginning in the first quarter of  such inter segment activity will be reflected at a transfer price which is based upon market pricing discounted for certain items 
as a result  sales in the engine segment and the filtration and other segment are expected to increase  as will the amount reflected in eliminations 
the expected impact on segment ebit cannot be determined since it will depend upon actual volumes and results 
engine business the net sales and segment ebit for the engine business segment for the last three years were as follows millions net sales    segment ebit total net sales for the engine business in increased million  or percent  compared to the increase was primarily due to strong sales of our isb engine for the dodge ram truck 
total automotive related engine sales were percent of engine business sales in compared to percent in and percent in net sales in increased million  or percent  compared to net sales in  primarily due to an upturn in demand from heavy duty truck oems prior to the october   new emissions standards and strong sales of our midrange engine for the dodge ram truck 
segment ebit increased million in  or percent  compared to the year over year improvement in earnings was primarily a result of higher engine volumes and the accompanying benefits of fixed cost absorption at our manufacturing plants and our consolidation of heavy duty test and assembly operations million  higher earnings from joint ventures and alliances million and reduced spending for research and development million  partially offset by increases in selling and administrative expenses million 
the increase in joint venture income was attributable to higher volumes and earnings from our recently expanded china joint venture  dongfeng cummins engine co 
ltd  and earnings from our north american distributorships 
the decrease in research and development expenses was a result of lower spending following the product launch of our emissions compliant engines 
the increase in selling and administrative expenses resulted from higher pension cost and higher variable compensation expense as a consequence of the earnings improvement 
segment ebit in improved million over the loss incurred in operating results for included a million pre tax charge for restructuring actions 
the year over year improvement was primarily attributable to better absorption of fixed costs as a result of higher engine volumes and benefits from cost reduction projects 
during and  the engine business lowered its break even level through restructuring actions and cost reduction efforts that were necessary to better align production costs with expected industry demand levels 
a summary and discussion of net sales for the engine business by market follows millions heavy duty truck   medium duty truck and bus light duty automotive total automotive    industrial   unit shipments for the engine business were  units in  an increase of  units  or percent  compared to unit shipments a year earlier 
unit shipments in were  an increase of  units  or percent  compared to shipments 
a summary of unit shipments by engine category for the last three years follows unit shipments midrange    heavy duty    high horsepower    heavy duty truck sales to the heavy duty truck market were billion in  up million  or percent  compared to sales in the increase was primarily attributable to modest recovery in the north american truck industry evidenced by strong fourth quarter demand as sales increased percent compared to the previous quarter 
unit shipments of heavy duty truck engines declined percent in compared the decrease in shipments compared to  was a result of the large pre buy activity prior to the north american october   epa emissions standards 
the decline in volumes was more than offset by the unit price increase in our new isx and ism emissions compliant engines and increased part sales 
in  sales of heavy duty truck engines increased million  or percent  compared to the increased sales were primarily in response to accelerated purchases prior to the october   date of the new epa emissions standards 
unit shipments of heavy duty truck engines were  units in compared to  units in  an increase of percent year over year 
medium duty truck and bus medium duty truck and bus revenues declined million  or percent  in compared to the majority of the decrease was a result of lower bus engine sales as engine sales for medium duty trucks were essentially flat compared to worldwide bus engine sales declined percent in and unit shipments declined percent  primarily in north america  due to a decline in market share from a major bus oem and lower engine sales to a china bus oem that were replaced by sales from one of our joint ventures in china 
sales to the medium duty truck and bus markets increased million  or percent  in compared to  reflecting a slight increase in demand as a result of the october   emissions standards 
unit shipments to north american medium duty truck oems declined percent in compared to while shipments to international oems increased percent  primarily in asia 
sales of bus engines declined percent globally compared to  while unit shipments declined percent  primarily to international oems as shipments to north american oems declined percent

engine shipments to daimlerchrysler for the dodge ram truck set a record in  increasing percent  compared to the prior year  primarily driven by increased demand and market share improvement 
unit shipments of medium duty engines to the recreational vehicle market declined percent year over year  reflecting a pre buy of engine models in prior to the new emissions standards 
sales to the light duty automotive market in increased million  or percent  compared to sales 
total unit shipments increased percent compared to the prior year  with shipments to daimlerchrysler up percent  primarily driven by the introduction of the new dodge ram truck model in mid year unit shipments to recreational vehicle oems increased percent year over year from previously weak demand levels reflecting some recovery in consumer markets and growth in the diesel powered segment of this market 
industrial total industrial sales in to the construction  mining  marine  agricultural  oil and gas  government and rail markets increased million  or percent  compared to  while unit shipments declined percent year over year reflecting a change in sales mix to higher priced engines 
approximately percent of total industrial unit shipments were to north american markets and percent to international markets 
sales to the construction segment of this market increased percent year over year with unit shipments to north american oems down percent and shipments to international oems up percent 
unit shipments of our k and q series high horsepower engines to mine equipment oems in north america declined percent in  while unit shipments to international oems increased percent  primarily from gains in market share 
engine shipments to the marine market declined percent in compared to  partially as a result of our new joint venture with brunswick corporation  cummins mercruiser diesel marine llc 
sales of our midrange and heavy duty engines for recreational marine applications are now recorded by the joint venture 
unit shipments of heavy duty engines to the recreational marine market increased percent in engine shipments to the agricultural equipment market increased percent compared to  as the percent decline in shipments to north american oems was more than offset by a percent increase in shipments to international oems in latin america 
engine shipments to the recently entered oil and gas market increased significantly in compared to a low base in  primarily due to market share penetration in north america with our k series engine 
sales of high horsepower engines to the government market  primarily v series military applications  increased percent in compared to unit shipments of our high horsepower k series engines to the rail equipment market  primarily international railcar builders  declined percent in as a result of weakening demand 
industrial engine sales in declined million  or percent  compared to  with declines in all major markets with the exception of agricultural which experienced strong demand from sales to latin america 
a majority of the decline in the industrial engine markets was attributable to lower capital spending as oems adjusted to weak market conditions 
consolidation of heavy duty engine assembly in the fourth quarter of  we consolidated our heavy duty engine assembly and test operations at our jamestown  ny plant 
this action was part of our continuing effort to reduce production costs 
approximately positions in the heavy duty engine business at our columbus  in plant were eliminated as a result of the consolidation 
the consolidation was completed during the first quarter of  and the costs of the consolidation were absorbed by current operations 
power generation business the net sales and ebit for the power generation business for the last three years were as follows millions net sales    segment ebit net sales in our power generation business were up million or percent  compared to a majority of the sales increase occurred in the second half of the year  as general economic conditions improved and demand for commercial power equipment began to recover 
overall  sales of generator drives increased percent  alternator sales increased percent  sales of small generator sets to the consumer mobile rv market increased percent and sales of commercial generator sets were flat year over year 
power generation net sales in were down million  or percent  compared to a majority of the decline was a result of slow economic growth and weak market demand in the commercial sector  as generator set sales declined percent and generator drive sales decreased percent 
the sales decline was partially offset by increased sales to the consumer mobile rv market  up percent compared to a summary of engine shipments for power generation by engine category follows unit shipments midrange    heavy duty    high horsepower    total unit sales for power generation in increased units  or percent  compared to and unit sales decreased  units  or percent  compared to sales of generator drive units powered by midrange engines were flat compared to  while unit sales of generator sets powered by midrange engines increased percent 
total sales of heavy duty engines increased  units  or percent  compared to shipments of heavy duty powered generator drive units increased percent from a year ago  while shipments of heavy duty powered generator sets increased percent 
high horsepower unit sales  which typically have higher margins  decreased units  or percent compared to unit sales of high horsepower generator drive units increased percent year over year  while unit sales of high horsepower generator sets decreased percent from the prior period 
the overall increase in unit sales of generator drive and generator sets is attributable to improvement in commercial markets during the second half of the year 
sales of power generation equipment in north america were flat in compared to with sales to international locations up percent  primarily in india  south pacific  brazil  mexico and europe 
alternator sales increased percent in compared to while sales of small generator sets for the consumer mobile rv market increased percent  reflecting strong demand in this segment and penetration of the consumer towable rv market 
total unit sales to power generation markets in decreased  units  or percent compared to generator drive units powered by midrange engines increased percent over the same period  while unit sales of generator sets powered by midrange engines were down percent

high horsepower unit sales decreased  units  or percent compared to unit sales of high horsepower generator drive units declined percent year over year  while unit sales of high horsepower generator sets decreased percent from the prior period 
the overall decline in unit sales of generator drive and generator sets was attributable to weak demand in commercial markets 
most of the decline in generator drive units for stationary power occurred in north america  latin america and europe and was offset by slight increases in shipments to india and southeast asia markets 
a majority of the decline in generator set units was attributable to weak demand in north america  latin america and europe 
sales of alternators increased percent in compared to  while sales of small generator sets for the consumer mobile rv market increased percent  reflecting strong demand in this segment 
in  power generation incurred a loss before interest and taxes of million  compared to a million loss before interest and taxes in  an improvement of million year over year 
the improvement was attributable to an increase in gross margin on higher sales during the second half of the year million and improved earnings at joint ventures million  partially offset by increased selling and administrative expenses million and other items that individually were not material 
the increase in sales was a result of modest demand improvement  primarily in the second half of the year  as overall economic conditions began to improve 
in  power generation incurred a loss before interest and taxes of million compared to segment ebit of million in the overall decline in earnings before interest and taxes year over year was attributable to a number of factors 
first was the decline in volume due to weak market conditions 
second was a shift in sales mix  with a decline in unit shipments of higher margin  heavy duty and high horsepower products to midrange powered products 
third  the overall decline in sales volume resulted in under absorption of fixed overhead costs at our manufacturing facilities 
fourth  excess inventory in the marketplace continued to create pricing pressures resulting in heavier discounting to retain market share 
finally  utilization of power generation s rental fleet was lower in compared to due to overall weak demand  resulting in lower profitability of our rental fleet business

approximately percent of the increase in net sales for this segment is attributable to holset products 
segment ebit for the filtration and other business declined million  or percent  compared to earnings were lower in primarily from higher selling and administrative expenses million and research and engineering expenses million offset by volume driven improvement in gross margin million and improved earnings at joint ventures million 
most of the increase in selling and administrative expenses was attributable to the incremental costs of funding targeted growth initiatives  increased logistics costs and higher employee benefit costs  including pensions 
segment ebit for the filtration and other business in was up million  or percent  compared to the improved profitability was driven by increased volumes and the discontinuance of approximately million in goodwill amortization 
in addition  benefits from restructuring actions and six sigma cost reduction efforts helped to offset incremental start up expenses from this segment s new emission solutions business 
international distributor business the net sales and segment ebit for the international distributor business segment for the three years ended december   were as follows millions net sales segment ebit was a record sales year for our international distributor business aided by strong fourth quarter sales

this reporting change did not affect earnings results in either business segment 
segment ebit for the international distributor business increased million in  or percent  compared to the increase in earnings was attributable to improved gross margin from higher sales volumes million  partially offset by increases in volume variable expenditures  primarily selling and administrative expenses million 
the million earnings improvement in compared to was primarily a result of increased engine  parts and service sales at our distributors in east asia  southeast asia and south pacific  offset by lower sales from distributors in central europe  primarily germany

liquidity and capital resources overview of capital structure since fiscal  we have made a strategic effort to improve our cost structure and improve efficiencies from continuing operations through monetization of assets and restructuring actions 
as a result  we have undertaken various initiatives to improve cash flow  reduce debt obligations and improve our financial flexibility 
our operations have historically generated sufficient cash to fund our businesses  capital expenditures  research and development and dividend payments 
cash provided by continuing operations is a major source of our working capital funding 
at certain times  cash provided by operations is subject to seasonal fluctuations  and as a result  we use periodic borrowings  primarily our receivable securitization program and our revolving credit facility  to fund our working capital requirements 
we entered into our receivable securitization program in the fourth quarter of  to provide a cost effective method to fund our trade accounts receivable 
this program diversified our funding base by providing a flexible source of funding that is not reported on our balance sheet 
in december  this program expired and there were no amounts outstanding under the program as of december  in january  we entered into a similar type of program with a different financial institution 
a more complete description of this accounts receivable securitization program  which discloses certain cash flows related to the program  is found below under the caption  off balance sheet financing accounts receivable securitization program and in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we have available various short and long term credit arrangements  which are discussed below and disclosed in note  borrowing arrangements  of our consolidated financial statements 
we believe our cash generated from operations  credit arrangements and our accounts receivable securitization program provide the financial flexibility required to satisfy future short term funding requirements for our debt service obligations  capital spending  pension funding  and projected working capital requirements 
our next major fixed cash payment obligation occurs in march when our notes with principal amount of million mature 
we expect to refinance or repay all or a portion of the principal amount of these notes prior to their maturity date 
as of december   our total debt including convertible subordinated debentures was billion compared to billion  including our preferred securities of subsidiary trust  at december  included in long term debt at december   is million attributable to consolidating a leasing entity in which we have a variable interest see notes and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
total debt  including our convertible subordinated debentures and in our preferred securities of subsidiary trust  as a percentage of our total capital including total long term debt  was percent at december   compared to percent at december  based on projected cash flows from operations and existing credit facilities  management believes the company has sufficient liquidity to meet anticipated capital  debt and dividend requirements in the foreseeable future 
restructuring actions during  and we recorded significant charges to restructure our operations  largely focused in our engine business 
these actions and the resulting charges were primarily taken in response to the downturn in the north american trucking industry and related conditions and included workforce reductions  asset impairment losses  termination of a new engine development program and other charges 
total net cash outflows associated with these actions approximated million  including million in  million in and million in the associated annual savings of these restructuring actions were estimated at million 
the restructuring actions we have taken during the last three years are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
all of our restructuring actions are complete and there are no future cash payment obligations related to these programs 
financing activity in november  we issued million of unsecured senior notes that mature in proceeds from the issuance were approximately million  net of debt issue costs and were used to repay our million notes that matured in march and for general corporate purposes  including repayment of balances outstanding at the end of under our receivable securitization program 
interest on the notes is payable on june and december each year 
we can redeem the notes in whole or in part at any time after december   at a premium value equal to of par  declining to par in  plus accrued interest 
in connection with the senior notes offering  we agreed to file an exchange offer registration statement with the sec and complete that offer no later than may  as a result of the delay in filing our annual report on form k with the sec  we were unable to complete the exchange offer and became contractually obligated to pay additional interest on the notes 
for each day delay in the completion of the exchange offer  the premium interest rate on the notes increased by an additional per annum up to a maximum increase until such time as the exchange offer is completed 
as of december   we were paying an additional interest on the notes and the total amount of premium paid in was million 
the exchange offer registration statement was declared effective on february  upon completion of the exchange offer expected in march  the interest rate on the notes will return to 
a more complete description of our senior notes is disclosed in note of the consolidated financial statements 
available credit capacity the following table provides the components of available credit capacity as of december  millions revolving credit facility international credit facilities accessible by local entities international credit facilities accessible by corporate treasury accounts receivable our receivable program expired in december in january  we entered into a new three year agreement for a similar revolving accounts receivable program with a different financial institution see discussion below under the caption off balance sheet financing accounts receivable securitization program 
cash flows the following table summarizes the key elements of our cash flows for the last three years millions net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash net change in cash and cash equivalents operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities declined million in the decrease was largely due to lower net earnings  down million year over year  partially offset by million of non cash reversal of restructuring actions in in addition  net non cash adjustments for equity in earnings of investees decreased million year over year due to higher joint venture earnings  while non cash adjustments for minority interests declined million 
cash from operations benefited by receiving million from joint ventures in compared to million of cash received in cash from operations was also impacted by contributions to our pension plans of million in compared to million in  or an incremental cash outflow of million 
net changes in working capital consumed million of cash during compared to million in  or an improvement in net cash used for working capital of million 
the change in net cash used for working capital was comprised of a reduction in accounts receivable of million and a million decrease in the repayment of sold receivables  which improved working capital year over year by million 
part of this improvement was offset by a million increase in inventory compared to a million decrease in inventory a year ago  or a net use of million in working capital 
most of the increase in inventory is a result of higher production levels necessary to meet increased demand 
accounts payable  accrued expenses and other items provided million of working capital in compared to a use of million in  with most of the increase resulting from higher pension liabilities and variable compensation 
investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities was million in compared to million a year ago  or a decrease of million 
a majority of the decrease was from lower investments in and advances to our joint ventures  down million in compared to the advances include both long term investment and short term funding for working capital needs of our joint ventures 
earnings at our joint ventures improved significantly in compared to  requiring less funding 
partially offsetting the higher advances to joint ventures in were million in proceeds from business dispositions 
cash outflows for capital expenditures and software increased million and million  respectively  in compared to  primarily in the second half of the year as business conditions improved and spending levels increased 
cash outflows for capital expenditures are expected to range between million and million in purchases of marketable securities used million of cash during compared to million in purchases a year ago  or a million cash outflow from investing activities  primarily at cummins india limited cil 
this decrease  however  was more than offset by million in cash proceeds from the sale of marketable securities in compared to million in cash proceeds from securities sales a year ago  or a net cash inflow of million year over year  again primarily from investing activities at cil 
financing activities 
during  our financing activities resulted in a cash outflow of million compared to a cash inflow of million a year ago 
a majority of the cash inflow in resulted from the issuance of our million senior notes during the fourth quarter 
net proceeds from this issuance were used to repay borrowings under our accounts receivable securitization program at the end of and for payment of our million notes that matured in march net borrowings of less than days under our short term credit arrangements provided million of cash in compared to a net million cash outflow in cash proceeds from the issuance of common stock were million in compared to million in  or an increase of million 
the increase is attributable to the exercise of a significant number of common stock options during the second half of the year due to favorable market conditions 
additional cash outflows from financing activities during and were million in dividend payments on common stock 
other financing transactions used million in cash in  compared to million used in  or a net cash ouflow of million  primarily from dividends paid to minority shareholders and retirement of common stock 
cash and cash equivalents decreased million during and were million at the end of the year compared to million at the beginning of the year 
cash and cash equivalents were higher in as a result of receiving million in proceeds in the fourth quarter from the issuance of our senior notes 
cash requirements a summary of payments due for our contractual obligations and commercial commitments  as of december   is shown in the tables below 
contractual cash obligations millions after total loans payable long term debt and capital lease obligations  operating leases capital expenditures purchase commitments for inventory other purchase commitments pension funding obligations pension funding obligations are included only for as the amount of our funding obligations beyond the next year are not yet determinable 
other commercial commitments millions after total standby letters of credit and performance bonds guarantees financial covenants and credit rating a number of our contractual obligations and financing agreements  such as our revolving credit facility and our equipment sale leaseback agreements  have restrictive covenants and or pricing modifications that may be triggered in the event of downward revisions to our corporate credit rating 
our corporate credit rating is determined by independent credit rating agencies and comprises an annual assessment of the creditworthiness of our debt securities and other obligations 
it is intended to measure the probability of the timely repayment of principal and interest of our notes and short term debt 
generally  a higher credit rating leads to a more favorable effect on the marketability of our debt instruments in the capital markets 
a credit rating of baa or higher by moody s or a rating of bbb or higher by standard poor s  two of the major credit rating agencies  is considered investment grade 
currently  the corporate credit rating of our debt securities is below investment grade 
in april  moody s lowered our long term and short term debt ratings primarily as a result of the continued weakness in the north american heavy duty truck market 
our senior unsecured long term debt rating was lowered from baa to ba with a stable outlook 
the short term rating  which applies to our short term borrowings  was lowered to not prime from prime at the same time  standard poor s reaffirmed its rating of cummins debt at bbb and expected our liquidity and credit protection measures to remain satisfactory for the current rating 
in october  moody s confirmed the long term rating of our senior debt at ba  but changed the outlook to negative from stable 
also in october  standard poor s lowered our corporate credit rating to bb from bbb with a negative outlook  primarily as a result of declining power generation sales and weak demand in the heavy and medium duty truck industry 
in november  moody s lowered our long term senior unsecured debt rating from ba to ba as a result of our securing borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
also in november  fitch initiated coverage of our debt and has not revised their rating since that time 
any rating can be revised upward or downward or withdrawn at any time by a rating agency if it decides the circumstances warrant that change  and there can be no assurance that our debt ratings will not be lowered further or withdrawn by a rating agency 
any future lowering of our debt ratings could further increase the cost of our financing agreements and arrangements  and may have a negative impact on our ability to access the capital markets or borrow funds at current rates 
we expect our corporate credit rating to be reviewed again in mid year our current ratings and ratings outlook from each of the credit rating agencies are shown in the table below 
each of the ratings should be viewed independently of any other rating 
credit rating agency senior l t debt rating s t debt rating outlook moody s investors service  inc ba non prime negative standard poor s bb wr negative fitch bb bb negative we do not believe a further downgrade of our credit rating will have a material impact on our financial results  financial condition or access to sufficient liquidity 
however  one of our goals is to regain an investment grade credit rating from the rating agencies 
to achieve that goal  we have put significant management focus on increasing earnings  improving cash flow and reducing financial leverage 
a discussion of the impact of the credit ratings on our financing arrangements follows 
revolving credit facility in november  we entered into a new revolving credit facility that replaced our prior revolving credit facility 
the credit facility provides for aggregate borrowings of up to million and is available on a revolving basis for a period of three years 
borrowings are primarily available in us dollars  although up to million of the new credit facility is available for multicurrency borrowing and letters of credit  up to million is available for letters of credit and up to million is available for swing line loans 
we and a number of our subsidiaries are permitted to borrow and obtain letters of credit under the new revolving credit facility  although the aggregate amount of borrowings by  and letters of credit issued for the benefit of  our subsidiaries under the new facility may not exceed million 
we guarantee all borrowings of our subsidiaries under the revolving credit facility 
in addition  our principal domestic subsidiaries guarantee all borrowings under the revolving credit facility  although certain of those guarantees are limited by the terms of our existing public indenture which governs a number of our existing notes and debentures that restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to incur or guarantee indebtedness  and are limited by similar terms in the indenture governing our million senior notes 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility other than swing line loans bear interest at a rate equal to  at our option the london inter bank offered rate libor plus a spread ranging from percent to percent based on our credit rating and utilization of the credit facility  or the alternate base rate rate or abr which is the greater of the administrative agent s prime rate and the federal funds effective rate plus percent plus a spread ranging from percent to percent based on our credit rating and utilization of the credit facility 
following the november downgrade from moody s discussed above  the effective rate of interest on our borrowings under the revolving credit facility increased from libor plus basis points to libor plus basis points 
the effective rate of interest on our borrowings under the revolving credit facility also increases basis points 
when more than one third of our borrowing capacity is utilized 
in january  we issued a letter of credit to a financial institution that resulted in the aggregate amount of letters of credit outstanding under this facility to exceed one third of our borrowing base 
as a result  interest on our borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility increased from libor plus basis points to libor plus basis points swing line loans bear interest at the abr plus a spread based on our credit rating and utilization of the new revolving credit facility or such other rate as is agreed to by us and the swing line lender 
we are required to pay quarterly facility fees on unused commitments under the new revolving credit facility  which fees are based upon our credit rating 
we also are required to pay an annual administration fee to the administrative agent for the facility 
our obligations and the obligations of our subsidiaries under the revolving credit facility are collateralized by security interests in substantially all of our assets and the assets of our domestic subsidiaries that guarantee obligations under the facility other than shares of stock or indebtedness of our subsidiaries that are restricted subsidiaries under the terms of our existing public indenture and other than assets that are considered principal properties of ours or of our restricted subsidiaries under the terms of our existing public indenture 
the terms of the revolving credit facility contain covenants that restrict our ability  and the ability of our subsidiaries  to among other things  incur liens  enter into sale and leaseback transactions  enter into merger  consolidation or asset sale transactions  dispose of capital stock of subsidiaries  incur subsidiary indebtedness and enter into swap transactions 
the revolving credit facility also restricts our ability to  under the terms of our existing public indenture  re designate unrestricted subsidiaries as restricted subsidiaries or designate future subsidiaries as restricted subsidiaries 
the revolving credit facility also contains the following financial covenants we may not permit our net worth which as defined in the credit agreement excludes the minimum pension liability and other adjustments to fall below an amount equal to the sum of billion and percent of the sum of our consolidated net earnings for each of the fiscal quarters commencing after september   to and including the most recent fiscal quarter prior to the date on which the net worth calculation is made and percent of the amount by which our net worth has increased as a result of our issuance of capital stock after september   we may not permit the ratio of the sum of our consolidated indebtedness and our securitization financings to the sum of our consolidated indebtedness  securitization financings and net worth to be equal to or greater than to  and we may not permit the ratio of our consolidated ebitda minus capital expenditures to our consolidated interest expense for any period of four consecutive quarters  to be less than to for purposes of the financial covenants described above  net worth  consolidated net income  consolidated indebtedness  consolidated ebitda  consolidated interest expense and other financial measurements are calculated in the manner provided by the terms of the revolving credit facility agreement 
as of december   there were no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility and we were in compliance with all of the covenants of that agreement 
off balance sheet financing sale of accounts receivable we entered into our accounts receivable securitization program in december under the terms of this program  we were required to maintain a minimum investment grade credit rating in our long term senior unsecured debt 
as a result of the moody s downgrade in april  we renegotiated the terms of the securitization agreement and amended the requirement to maintain a minimum investment grade credit rating 
the terms of the amendment provided for an increase in the interest rate and fees under the program of approximately million annually at then current funding levels 
as of december  and  there were no proceeds outstanding under this program 
in december  this program expired and in january  we entered into a similar agreement with a different financial institution for a three year revolving accounts receivable program 
under the terms of the new agreement  we sell an interest in a designated pool of trade receivables to a new  wholly owned special purpose subsidiary  cummins trade receivables  llc ctr 
the program is similar to our previous program except that the financial institution purchases an interest in the receivables directly rather than utilizing a commercial paper conduit 
the maximum amount of trade receivables that can be sold and outstanding at any point in time is limited to the lesser of million or the amount of eligible receivables held by ctr 
there are no provisions in the new agreement that require us to maintain a minimum investment credit rating  however the terms of the agreement contain the same financial covenants as those described above under our revolving credit facility 
sale leaseback transactions in  we entered into a sale leaseback agreement with a variable interest entity vie whereby we sold certain manufacturing equipment and leased it back under an operating lease 
as a result of the moody s downgrade in april  and the standard poor s downgrade in october  we were required under the lease agreement to obtain irrevocable  unconditional standby letters of credit in an amount of million 
the letters of credit were posted to the benefit of the equipment lessor and lenders and will remain in effect until we achieve and maintain a minimum investment grade credit rating for consecutive months 
if we had been unable to obtain these letters of credit  we would have satisfied our obligation under the lease agreement by borrowing funds under our revolving credit facility and posting the proceeds as collateral 
the november downgrade by moody s had no effect on this agreement 
note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements describes the sale leaseback transaction 
in december  we evaluated the impact of adopting fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin as it relates to the sale leaseback transaction described above 
under the provisions of fin  we determined that we had a variable interest in the lessor entity by virtue of our guaranteeing the residual value of the equipment at the end of the lease term and were deemed the primary beneficiary of the vie 
as a result  we have consolidated the vie in our consolidated financial statements and recorded the cumulative effect of this change as a change in accounting principle effective december  the cumulative effect of this change was million before related tax effects of million see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the consolidation of the vie had no affect on our current credit rating 
in september  we entered into two sale leaseback transactions with an aggregate value of million  whereby we sold and leased back two aircraft 
the leases were accounted for as operating leases 
the transactions resulted in the recording of a pre tax deferred gain of million that is being amortized over the life of the leases as a reduction in rent expense 
the base lease term for both leases is months and provides for an early buyout option in january at expected fair market value or we may purchase the aircraft at the end of the lease term for its then fair market value 
powerrent business in  our power generation business entered into an ongoing leasing program in which it builds and sells power generation equipment inventory to a financial institution and leases the equipment and related components back under a three month  noncancelable lease arrangement with subsequent renewals on a monthly basis up to a maximum of months 
the equipment is sold at cost and pursuant to lease accounting rules  the excess of the fair value of the equipment sold over its cost is recognized as prepaid rent and reflects the normal profit margin that would have been realized at the time of sale 
the margins on the equipment sales are deferred and the leases recorded as operating leases 
the prepaid rent is amortized ratably over the accounting lease term 
upon termination of the leases through a sale of the equipment to a third party  the previously deferred margins on the sale to the financial institution are recorded as income 
we sublease the equipment to customers under short term rental agreements with terms that vary based upon customer and geographic region 
during and  we entered into new leases for portions of the equipment million in and million in with a different lessor 
the new leases had a minimum two year non cancellable lease term with monthly renewal options for the transaction and four six month renewal options for the transaction 
the deferred margin associated with the equipment that transferred to the new lessors remains unchanged  as there was not an ultimate sale to a third party 
at the end of the renewal terms  we may either negotiate a lease extension with the lessor  purchase the equipment based on rates derived from the equipment s expected residual value or arrange the sale of the equipment to an unrelated third party for fair market value 
when the equipment is sold  we are obligated to pay the lessor the difference  if any  between the sales proceeds of the equipment and the lessor s unamortized value of the equipment up to the maximum amount of the residual guarantee 
for one lessor  the residual guarantee is equal to percent of the current unamortized balance 
for the second lessor  the residual guarantee ranges from percent to percent of the equipments original cost 
the maximum amount of the guarantees at december   at the end of the respective minimum legal lease terms  was million 
the lessor  or we  may terminate the leasing program at any time with respect to any equipment not yet leased 
in the event of such termination  we must arrange for and effect not later than one year from the termination date or upon expiration of the lease term  whichever occurs first  a termination of all leased equipment and a sale of all equipment provided that in the event the program is terminated or the equipment is sold  the unguaranteed residual value of the equipment shall equal should the lessor terminate the leasing program  we have the right to purchase all of the equipment at its then unamortized value not later than one year from the termination date or upon expiration of the lease term  whichever occurs first 
since the inception of the rental program  we have not incurred any losses on equipment sales under this program 
financing arrangements for related parties in accordance with the provisions of various joint venture agreements  we may purchase products and components from the joint ventures  sell products and components to the joint ventures and the joint ventures may sell products and components to unrelated parties 
the transfer price of products purchased from the joint ventures may differ from normal selling prices 
certain joint ventures agreements transfer product to us at cost  some transfer product to us on a cost plus basis and other agreements provide for the transfer of products at market value 
we purchase significant quantities of midrange diesel and natural gas engines  components and service parts from consolidated diesel company cdc  an unconsolidated general partnership 
the partnership was formed in with j 
i 
case case to jointly fund engine development and manufacturing capacity 
cummins and case now cnh global nv are general partners and each partner shares percent ownership in cdc 
under the terms of the agreement  cdc is obligated to make its entire production of diesel engines and related products available solely to the partners 
each partner is entitled to purchase up to one half of cdc s actual production and a partner may purchase in excess of one half of actual production to the extent productive capacity is available beyond the other partner s purchase requirement 
the partners are each obligated  unconditionally and severally  to purchase annually at least one engine or engine kit produced by cdc  provided a minimum of one engine or engine kit is produced 
the transfer price of cdc s engines to the partners must be sufficient to cover its manufacturing cost in such annual accounting period  including interest and financing expenses  but excluding depreciation expense other than scheduled depreciation expense as defined in the agreement 
in addition  each partner is obligated to contribute one half of the capital investment required to maintain plant capacity and each partner has the right to invest unilaterally in plant capacity  which additional capacity is available to the other partner for a fee 
to date  neither partner has made a unilateral investment in plant capacity at cdc 
we are not a guarantor of any of cdc s obligations or commitments  however  we are required as a partner  to provide up to percent of cdc s base working capital as defined by the agreement 
the amount of base working capital is calculated each quarter and if supplemental funding greater than the base working capital amount is required  the amount is funded through third party financing arranged by cdc  or we may elect to fund the requirement  although we are under no obligation to do so 
to date  when supplemental funding is required above the base working capital amount  we have elected to provide that funding to cdc 
if the amount of supplemental funding required is less than the base working capital amount  it is funded equally by the partners 
excess cash generated by cdc is remitted to cummins until cdc s working capital amount is reduced to the base working capital amount 
any further cash remittances from cdc to the partners are shared equally by the partners 
financing arrangements and guarantees of distributors  residual value guarantees and other guarantees and indemnifications north american distributors we have entered into an operating agreement with a financial institution that requires us to guarantee revolving loans  equipment term loans and leases  real property loans and letters of credit made by the financial institution to certain independent cummins and onan distributors in the united states  and to certain distributors in which we own an equity interest 
under the terms of the operating agreement  our guarantee of any particular financing is limited to the amount of the financing in excess of a particular distributor s borrowing base 
the borrowing base is equal to the amount that the distributor could borrow from the financial institution without cummins guarantee 
under the terms of the operating agreement  if any distributor is in default under any financing or if we default under the financial covenants of our million revolving credit agreement  we will be required to guarantee the entire amount of each distributor financing 
if our senior unsecured debt has a credit rating of less than ba from moody s or less than bb from standard poor s  we will be required to pay to the financial institution a monthly fee equal to percent per annum on the daily average outstanding balance of each financing arrangement 
further  if any distributor defaults under any financing arrangement  then we will also be required to purchase the assets of that distributor 
in january  we issued a letter of credit to the financial institution in the amount of million  covering the distributor borrowings in excess of their borrowing base 
as a result  we are no longer subject to the credit ratings trigger contained in the operating agreement provided we maintain and annually renew this letter of credit 
the operating agreement will continue in effect until february   and may be renewed for additional one year terms 
as of december   we had million of guarantees outstanding under the operating agreement relating to distributor borrowings of million 
we have entered into a guarantee agreement with a canadian financial institution in which we have agreed to guarantee borrowings of an independent distributor in canada 
under the terms of the agreement  our guarantee of any individual financing arrangement between the distributor and the financial institution is limited to percent of the aggregate principal amount of the financing 
as of december   we had million of guarantees outstanding under this guarantee agreement relating to the distributor s borrowings of million 
residual value guarantees leased equipment as more fully discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  we have various residual value guarantees on equipment leased under operating leases 
the amounts of those guarantees at december   are summarized as follows millions power rent lease program other residual guarantees total residual guarantees other guarantees in addition to the guarantees discussed above  from time to time we enter into other guarantee arrangements  including sale of foreign receivables with recourse and other miscellaneous guarantees of third party debt 
the maximum potential loss related to these other guarantees is million at december  indemnifications periodically  we enter into various contractual arrangements where we agree to indemnify a third party against certain types of losses 
common types of indemnifications include product liability and license  patent or trademark indemnifications as discussed more fully in note of our consolidated financial statements asset sale agreements where we agree to indemnify the purchaser against future environmental exposures related to the asset sold  and any contractual agreement where we agree to indemnify the counter party for losses suffered as a result of a misrepresentation in the contract 
because the indemnifications are not related to specific known liabilities and due to their uncertain nature  we are unable to estimate the maximum amount of the potential loss associated with these indemnifications 
application of critical accounting policies a summary of our significant accounting policies is included in note of our consolidated financial statements of this annual report 
we believe the application of our accounting policies on a consistent basis enables us to provide financial statement users with useful  reliable and timely information about our earnings results  financial position and cash flows 
our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles that often require management to make judgments  estimates and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the reported amounts presented and disclosed in the financial statements 
our management reviews these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience  changes in business conditions and other relevant factors they believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
in any given reporting period  our actual results may differ from the estimates and assumptions used in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies are those that may have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and also require management to exercise significant judgment due to a high degree of uncertainty at the time estimates are made 
our senior management has discussed the development and selection of our accounting policies  related accounting estimates and the disclosures set forth below with the audit committee of our board of directors 
we believe our critical accounting policies include those addressing the estimation of liabilities for product coverage programs  accounting for income taxes and pension benefits and estimates under our powerrent program 
product coverage costs we estimate and record a liability for product coverage programs  other than product recalls  at the time our products are sold 
our estimates are based on historical experience and reflect management s best estimates of expected costs at the time products are sold and subsequent adjustment to those expected costs when actual costs differ 
as a result of uncertainty surrounding the nature and frequency of product recall programs  the liability for such programs is recorded when the recall action is announced 
our warranty liability is affected by component failure rates  repair costs and the time of failure 
future events and circumstances related to these factors could materially change our estimates and require adjustments to our liability 
new product launches require a greater use of judgment in developing estimates until historical experience becomes available 
product specific experience is typically available four or five quarters after product launch  with a clear experience trend evident eight quarters after launch 
we record product coverage expense for new products upon shipment using a factor based upon historical experience only in the first year  a blend of actual product and historical experience in the second year and product specific experience thereafter 
note of the consolidated financial statements contains a summary of the activity in our product coverage liability account for and  including adjustments to pre existing warranties 
accounting for income taxes we determine our provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
future tax benefits of tax loss and credit carryforwards are also recognized as deferred tax assets 
we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets each quarter by assessing the likelihood of future profitability and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize our net deferred tax assets 
at december   the company has recorded net deferred tax assets of million 
these assets include million for the value of tax loss and credit carryforwards that generally have a limited life and begin expiring in the ultimate realization of our net deferred tax assets will require a higher level of profitability than the company has achieved in recent years 
having assessed the future profit plans and tax planning strategies together with the years of expiration of carryforward benefits  a valuation allowance of million has been recorded to reduce the tax assets to the net value management believes is more likely than not to be realized 
should the company s operating performance not improve  future assessments could conclude that a larger valuation allowance will be needed to further reduce the deferred tax assets 
factors that may affect our ability to achieve a higher level of profitability include  but are not limited to  a decline in sales or gross margin  loss of market share  increased competition and existing and future regulatory emissions standards 
in addition  we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to tax audits in these jurisdictions 
these audits can involve complex issues  which may require an extended period of time to resolve 
however  we believe we have made adequate provision for income taxes for all years that are subject to audit 
a more complete description of our income taxes and the future benefits of our tax loss and credit carryforwards are disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
pension benefits we sponsor a number of pension plans in the us  the us and various other countries 
in the us and the us we have several major defined benefit plans that are separately funded 
we account for our pension programs in accordance with sfas no 
employers accounting for pensions which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined using an actuarial basis 
as a result  our pension benefit programs are based on a number of statistical and judgmental assumptions that attempt to anticipate future events and are used in calculating the expense and liability related to our plans 
these assumptions include discount rates used to value liabilities  assumed rates of return on plan assets  future compensation increases and employee turnover rates 
in addition  there are also subjective actuarial assumptions relating to retirement age  mortality rates and participant withdrawals 
the actuarial assumptions we use may differ significantly from actual results due to changing economic conditions  participant life span  and withdrawal rates 
these differences may result in a material impact to the amount of pension expense to be recorded in our consolidated financial statements in the future 
the table below presents the key components that have impacted our pension liability for the three previous years december  millions components weighted average discount rate actual asset return cash funding benefit payments as a result of lower investment returns experienced in and  we changed our pension plan asset return assumptions  which had an impact on pension expense and pension liability in our expected long term rate of return on assets was lowered to percent in the us and percent for non us plans with consultation from and the concurrence of  our actuaries 
the effect of lowering this rate of return assumption increased our pension expense  as measured in accordance with sfas no 
 by approximately million compared to the amount recorded in total pension expense increased million in compared to during  the actual asset returns for our pension plans was a negative percent and was adversely affected by the decline in equity markets 
in  our actual return on plan assets was percent and was affected by favorable equity markets 
we do not expect to change our rate of return assumption on pension plan assets for in addition  the discount rate for our us plans declined from percent at november   to percent at november  and from percent at november   to percent at november   for our non us plans 
pension expense in any given period is determined based upon the value of pension plan assets as compared to the service cost of pension liabilities the actuarial cost of benefits earned during the period and the interest on those liabilities 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets that recognizes changes in fair value over a five year period 
this practice is intended to reduce year to year volatility in recorded pension expense  but it can also have the effect of delaying the recognition of differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return based on long term rate of return assumptions 
as a result of this practice  prior period reductions in the value of plan assets may continue to impact pension expense in future periods 
our pension expense was million in  while pension expense is expected to be approximately million 
our pension expense will depend upon a number of variables and assumptions  including discount rates  actual asset returns and other factors as previously discussed 
the table below sets forth the estimated impact on our pension expense relative to a change in the discount rate 
while we do not presently anticipate further adjustments to our expected rate of return on plan assets  the following table also illustrates the impact on expected pension expense relative to a change in the expected rate of return on plan assets

powerrent program our power generation operating segment offers containerized generator sets for rent in its powerrent program 
the generator sets  originally manufactured by the company  are sold to a financial institution and leased back for utilization in the rental fleet 
the rental fleet is worldwide and leases are with multiple parties 
the leases have residual value guarantees 
most leases are operating leases for accounting purposes and this accounting determination must be continually assessed 
accounting principles for leases require management to periodically assess certain assumptions including the accounting lease term 
business dynamics can influence this judgment 
specifically  management must assess the likelihood at each lease renewal date whether future renewals are reasonably assured and should be included in the accounting lease term 
as a part of this assessment  management must determine the time period it would expect to dispose of the associated equipment  and this judgment is influenced by market factors 
information available to management includes historical sales activity and current quoting activity for used equipments sales 
in addition  the underlying terms of rental agreements by customers of the rental fleet are a consideration to this judgment and these terms are also impacted by market conditions 
the duration of such rental agreements is a consideration in the determination of the lease term 
as we provide a residual value guarantee to the lessor  management must also periodically assess the likelihood of payments under these guarantees upon the termination of the lease 
if management determines that a payment under the residual guarantee is probable  the estimated exposure must be accrued over the accounting lease term 
our estimated exposure under the residual value guarantee is dependent upon our ability to estimate the likely value of the equipment at the end of the accounting lease term 
management s assessment is dependent upon expectations in the marketplace as well as specifics about the units  such as the type  size and amount of equipment in the fleet and the age and hours of use of the equipment 
while we have not had a loss under the residual guarantee in the past  future assessments may result in a different conclusion 
in summary  market conditions can impact the determination that these leases are operating leases 
a change in market conditions could impact management s assessment and it is possible that a portion of the leases for the powerrent equipment could become capital leases at a particular renewal date 
as noted in liquidity and capital resources  the company currently has contractual provisions which limit the amount of such indebtedness 
disclosure regarding forward looking statements certain parts of this annual report contains forward looking statements that are based on current expectations  estimates and projections about the industries in which we operate and management s beliefs and assumptions 
forward looking statements are generally accompanied by words  such as anticipates  intends  plans  believes  seeks  estimates or similar expressions 
these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks  uncertainties and assumptions  which we refer to as future factors  which are difficult to predict 
therefore  actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in such forward looking statements 
future factors that could cause our results to differ materially from the results discussed in such forward looking statements are discussed below 
we undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
future factors that could affect the outcome of forward looking statements include the following price and product competition by foreign and domestic competitors  including new entrants  rapid technological developments of diesel engines  the ability to continue to introduce competitive new products in a timely  cost effective basis  the sales mix of products  the achievement of lower costs and expenses  domestic and foreign governmental and public policy changes  including environmental regulations  protection and validity of patent and other intellectual property rights  reliance on large customers  technological  implementation and cost financial risks in increasing use of large  multi year contracts  the cyclical nature of our business  the outcome of pending and future litigation and governmental proceedings  and continued availability of financing  financial instruments and financial resources in the amounts  at the times and on the terms required to support our future business 
in addition  such statements could be affected by general industry and market conditions and growth rates  general domestic and international economic conditions  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations and other future factors 
business outlook following three consecutive years of below trend demand in our businesses  most economic indicators point toward strong improvement in cummins performance 
we expect heavy duty truck sales and production to increase significantly as aging fleets begin to replace older equipment and demand for freight capacity improves resulting in increased sales of our new emissions mandated heavy duty engines 
our isx engine was the first heavy duty truck engine to be certified and compliant to the epa standards when first introduced in april since then  more than  isx and ism engines have been shipped and have accumulated in excess of billion miles of service 
these new engines  all of which use egr to meet emissions standards  have been performing as expected and are being well received among fleet owners in the industry 
currently  we are estimating heavy duty truck production in north america at  to  units  or approximately percent higher than production levels 
we also expect increased sales of our emissions compliant midrange engines to the medium duty truck  bus and recreational vehicle markets in  as economic indicators for these markets historically correlate with those of the heavy duty market 
currently  we estimate worldwide medium duty truck demand to increase percent in in january  we began supplying our re engineered liter turbo diesel engine to the model year dodge ram truck 
this new truck model offers best in class lb ft of torque and horsepower  and we expect the launch of this popular vehicle will result in strong sales volumes as demand for diesel powered light vehicles continues to increase 
most economists are forecasting that will be the first year of recovery for non residential construction spending following the domestic recovery 
with lower interest rates we expect overall demand among equipment oems to increase  resulting in higher sales of our industrial engines 
our power generation business experienced peak demand for stationary generator sets and stand by generator sets in  reflecting yk fears and other factors 
as energy prices began to fall in and and the economy slowed  inventory levels remained high resulting in excess capacity and market pricing pressures 
while we believe demand for power generation equipment has bottomed  and the northeast blackout accelerated some capacity absorption  we are anticipating a slow recovery in however  we expect profitability to return to this segment based on benefits from our restructuring actions and continued progress on cost reduction 
in our filtration and other business  we expect the market opportunity to more than double by based upon the worldwide implementation of new emissions standards for gas and diesel engines 
our international distributor business  which is retail oriented and comprised of company owned distributors and two joint ventures in key geographical markets  has historically demonstrated steady sales growth and stable profit margins 
as the worldwide economy continues to improve and our engine population increases  we expect sales growth and profit margins to continue in this segment as we capitalize on a growing global customer base 
as part of our long term business strategy  we have actively pursued and secured multiple international joint ventures and alliances to increase our market penetration through the manufacture of our engines and other products  streamlining our supply chain management and developing new technologies 
our joint ventures and alliances generated million of operating income in  million in and million in we expect business growth in our joint ventures to continue in  particularly in asia  where we recently expanded capacity through our partnership that sells engines to the second largest truck manufacturer in china 
we expect to generate sufficient cash from operations to fund our businesses  capital expenditures  research and development  pension funding and dividend payments in we have available various short and long term credit arrangements  which are discussed above and disclosed in note borrowing arrangements of our consolidated financial statements 
these credit arrangements and other programs  such as our accounts receivable securitization program  provide the financial flexibility to satisfy future short term funding requirements of our debt service obligations and projected working capital requirements when needed 
with the exception of payments required under our operating lease agreements  principal and interest payments on notes issued by a consolidated vie and our pension funding commitments  there are no major fixed cash payment obligations occurring until march when our notes with principal amount of million mature 
we expect to repay or refinance all or a part of the principal amount of these notes prior to their maturity date 
based on projected cash flows from operations and existing credit facilities  we believe we will have sufficient liquidity in to meet anticipated capital  pension  and dividend funding requirements and reduce our debt obligations

sfas establishes standards for how companies classify and measure certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas requires financial instruments meeting certain criteria to be reported as liabilities that were previously reflected as equity or in between liabilities and equity 
we adopted sfas for our existing financial instruments on july  the adoption of this statement resulted in the classification of our obligations associated with the convertible preferred securities of subsidiary trust as a liability and resulted in the classification of the dividend payments on these securities as interest expense in our consolidated statements of earnings beginning july  the adoption of this statement did not impact net earnings 
on december   due to the adoption of fin  we no longer report the preferred securities as a liability  rather we now report the junior convertible subordinated debentures as a liability as more fully discussed in note of the consolidated financial statements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial risk resulting from changes in foreign exchange rates  interest rates and commodity prices 
this risk is closely monitored and managed through the use of financial derivative instruments including commodity price swaps  forward contracts and interest rate swaps 
as clearly stated in our policies and procedures  financial instruments are used expressly for hedging purposes  and under no circumstances are they used for speculative purposes 
our hedging transactions are entered into with banking institutions that have strong credit ratings  and thus the credit risk associated with these transactions is not considered significant 
the results and status of our hedging transactions are reported to senior management on a monthly and quarterly basis 
note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contains further information regarding financial instruments and risk management 
the following describes our risk exposures and provides results of sensitivity analyses performed on december  the sensitivity test assumes instantaneous  parallel shifts in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
foreign exchange rates we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk as a result of our international business presence 
we transact extensively in foreign currencies and have significant assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
as a result  our earnings experience some volatility related to movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
in order to benefit from global diversification and after considering naturally offsetting currency positions  we enter into forward contracts to minimize our existing exposures recognized asset and liability and hedge forecasted transactions 
the objective of our hedging program is to reduce the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on earnings by essentially creating offsetting currency exposures 
as of december   the potential gain or loss in the fair value of our outstanding foreign currency contracts  assuming a hypothetical percent fluctuation in the currencies of such contracts  would be approximately million 
the sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates assumes the notional value to remain constant for the next months 
the analysis ignores the impact of foreign exchange movements on our competitive position and potential changes in sales levels 
it should be noted that any change in the value of the contracts  real or hypothetical  would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged items 
see note  derivatives and other financial instruments  of the consolidated financial statements 
interest rates we are also exposed to interest rate risk as a result of our indebtedness 
our objective in managing our exposure to changes in interest rates is to limit the effect of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall cost of borrowing 
to achieve this objective  we primarily use interest rate swap agreements to manage exposure to interest rate changes related to our borrowing arrangements 
in november  we terminated an interest rate swap relating to our notes that mature in the swap converted million notional amount from fixed rate debt into floating rate debt that would have matured in the termination of this swap resulted in a million gain 
the gain is being amortized to earnings as a reduction of interest expense over the remaining life of the debt 
the amount of gain recognized during and was million and million  respectively 
the remaining balance of the deferred gain is classified as long term debt in our consolidated statement of financial position 
in march  we terminated three fixed to floating interest rate swap agreements related to our notes with principal amount of million due in and notes with principal amount of million due in the termination of these swaps resulted in a million gain 
the gain is being amortized to earnings as a reduction of interest expense over the remaining life of the debt 
the amount of gain recognized during and was million and million  respectively 
the remaining balance of the deferred gain is classified as long term debt in our consolidated statements of financial position 
as of december   we do not own any interest rate swap agreements 
see note of the consolidated financial statements commodity prices we are also exposed to fluctuations in commodity prices through the purchase of raw materials as well as contractual agreements with component suppliers 
to reduce the effect of raw material price changes for select commodities  we enter into commodity swap contracts to hedge a portion of our anticipated raw material purchases 
as of december   the potential gain or loss related to the outstanding commodity swap contracts  assuming a hypothetical fluctuation in the price of such commodities  would be approximately million 
the sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in commodity prices assumes the notional value to remain constant for the next months 
the analysis ignores the impact of commodity price movements on our competitive position and potential changes in sales levels 
it should be noted that any change in the value of the swaps  real or hypothetical  would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged items 
see note of the consolidated financial statements
