table of contents strategic overview bay view capital corporation the company  we  us  or our is a financial services company headquartered in san mateo  california  whose primary subsidiary  bay view acceptance corporation bvac  specializes in indirect purchases of retail automobile installment contracts originated by manufacturer franchised and independent dealers in connection with the sale of new and used automobiles 
bvac generates revenue through its investment in installment contracts  and the subsequent securitization or sale and servicing of these installment contracts 
our strategy on october   our stockholders authorized a plan of dissolution and stockholder liquidity the plan and the sale of the retail banking assets of bay view bank  na the bank to na bank  na na bank 
under the plan  our board of directors is authorized to determine the most efficient means of liquidation  and the timing of the process 
we originally contemplated that we would sell all of our assets  pay all of our liabilities and then distribute the proceeds  including the stock of bvac  to our stockholders 
in the year following the adoption of the plan  we sold substantially all of our assets with the exception of our auto lease portfolio and bvac 
as a result of our stockholders authorization of the plan and the closing of the us bank transaction on november   we adopted liquidation basis accounting  effective september   in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
because of changing market conditions in the auto finance sector  as discussed elsewhere herein  we believed that the near term sale or distribution of the stock of bvac to stockholders was no longer the best method of achieving maximum stockholder value 
accordingly  during the fourth quarter of  our board of directors adopted a plan of partial liquidation the amended plan under which we will complete the liquidation of the assets and satisfaction of the liabilities of the bank remaining after the bank s september  dissolution  distribute the proceeds to our stockholders through a series of cash distributions  and continue to operate bvac on an ongoing basis 
in accordance with the amended plan  we distributed per share in cash to our stockholders on december  we intend to make further distributions of the proceeds to our stockholders through a series of cash distributions 
following  in general terms  is a description of the federal income taxation of distributions as a result of the company s change from a plan of complete liquidation to a plan of partial liquidation 
stockholders should consult with their tax advisors to determine their individual tax situations 
for non corporate stockholders  the distribution of per share on december  should be treated as an exchange that generates capital gain or loss 
the capital gain or loss is the difference between the per share distribution and the allocated cost basis per share 
such allocated cost basis is equal to the stockholder s cost basis multiplied by  which is the ratio of the distribution to the average per share price on the distribution date of 
any such basis allocated to the exchange would reduce the stockholder s remaining cost basis 
these rules are described in irs revenue ruling for corporate stockholders  the distribution should be taxable as a dividend 
for all stockholders  distributions after will be taxed as dividends to the extent of the company s current or accumulated earnings and profits  with any excess being treated first as a return of capital to the extent of any remaining cost basis in the stock  then as a capital gain 
our decision to partially liquidate and to continue to operate bvac on an ongoing basis  warranted the termination of our use of the liquidation basis of accounting 
we re adopted the going concern basis of accounting and re established our stockholders equity effective october  at december   we had stockholders equity of million 
effective september   we completed the dissolution of the bank 
as a result  the company ceased to be a bank holding company and we and our subsidiaries are no longer subject to supervision  examination and regulation by the board of governors of the federal reserve system the frb  the office of the comptroller of the currency or the federal deposit insurance corporation 

table of contents auto finance bvac is a southern california based auto finance company engaged in the indirect financing of automobile purchases by individuals 
bvac is our primary remaining subsidiary 
as an indirect lender  bvac markets to automobile dealerships  both manufacturer franchised dealerships and independent dealerships  and purchases installment contracts on new and used vehicles from over  auto dealers in states 
of the contracts purchased in  approximately were originated by manufacturer franchised dealerships and approximately were originated by independent dealerships  were contracts on new vehicles and were contracts on used vehicles 
bvac purchases installment contracts with limited recourse to the dealer 
bvac has positioned itself in the market as a premium priced lender for well qualified borrowers seeking extended financing terms and higher advances than those generally offered by traditional lenders 
bvac places a strong emphasis on borrower stability  credit quality  and debt serviceability 
with fair  isaac co 
fico credit scores that averaged in  bvac s borrower base is largely comprised of prime borrowers 
bvac offers loan terms to months and typically finances an amount in excess of a dealer s wholesale value of a vehicle 
bvac will finance vehicles without restrictions on the model year 
during  the average loan amount bvac financed was  and had an average term of months 
we believe that this strategy has enabled bvac to establish a loyal dealership network by satisfying consumer demand within the indirect auto finance market that is inadequately served by commercial banks and finance companies 
bvac utilizes a proprietary credit scoring system in connection with its underwriting and credit approvals 
the credit scoring system captures data from consumers credit bureau reports  consumers loan applications and the terms of proposed loans 
we entered the auto finance business in through our acquisition of ctl  inc  the parent company of california thrift loan 
california thrift loan began its auto finance operations in  and through a series of mergers and name changes  became bvac 
since the liquidation of the bank  bvac has operated as an independent finance company  rather than a portfolio lending unit of the bank  purchasing installment contracts for sale or securitization 
bvac has a million revolving warehouse credit facility for funding its purchases of contracts prior to securitization or sale 
at december   bvac had million outstanding under this credit facility 
bvac intends to periodically securitize and sell its production of installment contracts in order to repay the line of credit 
bvac periodically transfers installment contracts to securitization trusts 
the trusts then issue asset backed securities 
bvac has structured these transactions as sales of the installment contracts 
bvac retains the servicing obligation on the contracts that it securitizes or sells 
in order to enhance the credit rating of these asset backed securities  bvac has a financial guaranty insurance policy and deposits cash into a restricted cash account established within the securitization trusts 
excess cash flow from the trusts is utilized to build the restricted cash account to pre designated levels and provide further credit enhancement 
once these pre designated levels are attained  excess cash flow is distributed to bvac 
in addition to this excess cash flow  bvac earns monthly fee income for servicing outstanding installment contracts that have been securitized and collects late payment charges and other fees 
bvac is continuing a geographic expansion plan that it initiated in late from its established presence in states  primarily in the west and midwest  as well as florida  bvac entered seven mid atlantic states in in  bvac plans to enter nine additional states primarily in new england  as well as oklahoma 
historically  bvac has aligned itself with smaller  franchised and independent dealers 
in recent years  the industry has experienced intense merger and acquisition activity which has led to the emergence of large  regional and national automobile dealership organizations  causing bvac to lose production volume from its existing dealer base 
in response  during bvac began a campaign to establish relationships with these regional and national dealer organizations and has now signed agreements with five of these organizations representing dealership stores 
during  bvac will continue to pursue this strategy 
bvac uses a combination of regional marketing representatives and telemarketing to develop and maintain relationships with the majority of its dealer base and market its indirect financing programs 
account development managers develop and maintain relationships with bvac s larger regional and national dealership organizations
