critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
these accounting principles require us to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions 
we believe that the estimates  judgments and assumptions  upon which we rely  are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that they are made 
these estimates  judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
to the extent there are differences between these estimates  judgments or assumptions and actual results  our financial statements may be affected 
the accounting policies that we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following revenue recognition  accounting for income taxes  and valuation of long lived and intangible assets 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap and does not require management s judgment in its application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result 
senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with our audit committee 
see notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein  which contain additional information regarding our accounting policies and other disclosures required by gaap 
we have identified the policies listed below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
revenue recognition 
our revenues are derived from fees for services generated on a project by project basis 
a majority of the company s contracts are billed on a time and materials basis 
time and materials contracts represented  and of revenues for years ended december    and  respectively 
revenues related to time and materials contracts are generally recognized based on the number of hours worked by our consultants at agreed upon rates 
revenues under time and materials contracts are generally recognized in the period in which the services are performed 
we also perform level support services on a fixed fee basis 
fixed fee services represented   and for the years ended december    and  respectively 
revenue pursuant to fixed price contracts is recognized under the proportional performance method of accounting 
over the course of a fixed price contract  we routinely evaluate whether revenue and profitability should be recognized in the current period 
to measure the performance and our ability to recognize revenue and profitability on fixed price contracts  we compare actual direct costs incurred to the total estimated direct costs and determine the percentage of the contract that is complete 
this percentage is multiplied by the estimated total contract value to determine the amount of net revenue recognized  subject to any warranty provisions and other holdbacks on revenue 
any warranty provisions included in fixed price contracts are accounted for as a holdback of revenue until such provisions are satisfied 
a formal project review process takes place monthly although most projects are evaluated on an ongoing basis 
management reviews the estimated total direct costs on each contract to determine if the estimated amounts are reasonable  and estimates are adjusted as needed 
fixed price contracts represented   and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
revenues and earnings may fluctuate from year to year based on the number  size and scope of projects in which we are engaged  the contractual terms and degree of completion of such projects  any delays incurred in connection with a project  employee utilization rates  the adequacy of provisions for losses  the use of estimates of resources required to complete ongoing projects  general economic conditions and other factors 
certain significant estimates include estimates used for fixed price contracts and the allowance for doubtful accounts 
these items are frequently monitored and analyzed by management for changes in facts and circumstances  which could affect our estimates 
reimbursement of out of pocket expenses charged to customers are reflected as revenue 
accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  the carrying value of deferred tax assets and liabilities and the valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a million valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets as december  and  respectively  due to potential uncertainty related to our ability to utilize some of our deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain net operating losses carried forward and foreign tax credits  before they expire 
we consider scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  ongoing tax planning strategies and other matters  including the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable in assessing the need for and the amount of the valuation allowance 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  adjustments to the deferred tax assets may be recorded  which could materially impact our financial position and net income loss in the period 
the net deferred tax asset was million as of december   which amount management believes will be realized 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets 
we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill annually through the use of a third party appraiser  and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important  which could trigger an impairment review include significant negative industry or economic trends  significant operating underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future results  significant decline in our stock price or the stock price of our industry peers and or a decline in our market capitalization relative to our net book value 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based upon legal factors  market conditions and operational performance 
our company adopted sfas no 
in and in accordance therewith  recorded as a change in accounting principle  a non cash impairment charge of million upon adoption on january  on december   our selected annual measurement date  our company recorded an additional non cash charge of million due to a further impairment of goodwill
