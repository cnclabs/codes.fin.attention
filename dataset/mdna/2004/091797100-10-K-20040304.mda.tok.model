item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the corporation is a global manufacturer and marketer of power tools and accessories  hardware and home improvement products  and technology based fastening systems 
as more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the corporation operates in three reportable business segments power tools and accessories  hardware and home improvement  and fastening and assembly systems with these business segments comprising approximately   and  respectively  of the corporation s sales in the percentage of the corporation s total sales contributed by its hardware and home improvement segment will increase in when a full year s sales of the baldwin and weiser businesses  acquired on september   are included in that segment s results 
the corporation markets its products and services in over countries 
during  approximately   and of its sales were made to customers in the united states  in europe including the united kingdom  and in other geographic regions  respectively 
the power tools and accessories and hardware and home improvement segments are subject to general economic conditions in the countries in which they operate as well as the strength of the retail economies 
the fastening and assembly systems segment is also subject to general economic conditions in the countries in which it operates as well as to automotive and industrial demand 
the corporation reported net earnings of million  or per share on a diluted basis  for the year ended december   compared to net earnings of million  or per share on a diluted basis  for the year ended december  net earnings from continuing operations for the year ended december   included a pre tax restructuring charge of million million net of tax 
that million pre tax restructuring charge was net of million  representing reversals of previously provided restructuring reserves as well as the excess of proceeds received on the sale of long lived assets  written down as part of restructuring actions  over their adjusted carrying values 
net earnings from continuing operations for the year ended december   included a pre tax restructuring charge of million million net of tax 
that million pre tax restructuring charge was net of million  representing reversals of previously provided restructuring reserves as well as the excess of proceeds received on the sale of long lived assets  written down as part of restructuring actions  over their adjusted carrying values 
the increase in the corporation s net earnings and earnings per share for  as compared to  is partially attributable to the lower level of restructuring and exit costs recognized in total consolidated sales for the year ended december   of billion increased by over the prior year level 
of that increase  is attributable to an increase in unit volume  with approximately half of the increase in unit volume attributable to the incremental sales in the fourth quarter of from the acquired baldwin and weiser businesses  and is attributable to the favorable impact of foreign currency translation  offset by attributable to the negative effect of pricing actions 
operating income for the year ended december   increased to million from million in this increase was principally attributable to a one percentage point increase in gross margin as a percentage of sales in as compared to this gross margin increase was driven by the corporation s restructuring actions 
selling  general  and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales in increased slightly from the increase in operating income for the year ended december  as compared to the level was also aided by a million decrease in restructuring and exit costs 
earnings from continuing operations before income taxes for the year ended december  increased by million over the level to million 
in addition to the improvement in operating income previously noted  earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased due to a reduction in net interest expense of million in as compared to the level 
that reduction in net interest expense was principally the result of lower borrowing levels and  to a lesser extent  lower interest rates 
in the discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations that follows  the corporation generally attempts to list contributing factors in order of significance to the point being addressed 
sales the following chart provides an analysis of the consolidated changes in sales for the years ended december    and year ended december  dollars in millions total sales    unit volume price currency change in total sales total consolidated sales for the year ended december   were  million  which represented a increase over sales of  million 
total unit volume had a positive impact on sales during compared to approximately half of the increase in unit volume was attributable to the incremental sales in the fourth quarter of from the acquired baldwin and weiser businesses 
the remainder of the increase in unit volume was due to higher sales of the power tools and accessories and security hardware businesses  particularly in north america  partially offset by a unit volume decline in the plumbing products business 
pricing actions  taken in response to customer and competitive pressures  had a negative effect on sales for as compared to the effects of a weaker us dollar compared to other currencies  particularly the euro and  to a lesser degree  the pound sterling and canadian dollar  caused a increase in the corporation s consolidated sales during over the prior year level 
these positive effects were partially offset by the devaluation of several latin american currencies during as compared to total consolidated sales for the year ended december   were  million  which represented a increase over sales of  million 
total unit volume had a positive impact on sales during compared to the increase in unit volume was primarily attributable to higher unit volume in both the power tools and accessories and security hardware businesses in north america as well as unit volume increases in sales to automotive customers by the fastening and assembly systems segment 
these increases were partially offset by a unit volume decline in the plumbing products business 
pricing actions  taken as a result of customer and competitive pressure  had a negative effect on sales for as compared to the effect of a weaker us dollar compared to certain other foreign currencies  particularly the euro and the pound sterling  caused a increase in the corporation s consolidated sales during over the prior year level 
earnings the corporation reported consolidated operating income of million on sales of  million in  compared to operating income of million on sales of  million in and to operating income of million on sales of  million in consolidated operating income for   and included a pre tax restructuring charge of million  million  and million  respectively 
those   and pre tax charges were net of reversals of million  million  and million  respectively  representing reversals of previously provided restructuring reserves as well as the excess of proceeds received on the sale of long lived assets  written down as part of restructuring actions  over their adjusted carrying values 
operating income for the year ended december   included goodwill amortization of million 
no goodwill amortization is included in the or results due to a change in accounting standards 
consolidated gross margin as a percentage of sales for was as compared to for the increase in gross margin in was attributable to several positive factors that included i the positive effect of restructuring initiatives  ii higher productivity  including six sigma productivity initiatives  and iii favorable foreign currency exchange rates 
these positive factors were partially offset by pricing actions taken by the corporation in response to customer and competitive pressures and by lower production levels in as compared to consolidated gross margin as a percentage of sales for was as compared to for the increase in gross margin in was attributable to several positive factors that included i higher productivity  including six sigma productivity initiatives  ii higher production levels as the corporation returned to more normal production levels in its power tools and accessories business in  after lowering production levels in to reduce inventories  iii more favorable product mix  and iv savings associated with restructuring actions 
these positive factors more than offset the cost of end user promotional programs as well as pricing actions taken by the corporation as a result of customer and competitive pressure 
consolidated selling  general  and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were in  compared to in and in selling  general  and administrative expenses increased by million in over the level 
the effects of foreign currency translation and acquired businesses accounted for million and million of the increase in selling  general  and administrative expenses  respectively 
the corporation recognized goodwill amortization of million in there was no goodwill amortization recorded in or the increase in selling  general  and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales from to was primarily a result of higher marketing and promotional expenses  which were partially offset by lower selling  general  and administrative expenses  including expenses associated with legal and environmental matters 
selling  general  and administrative expenses for rose  as compared to  as the corporation increased its reserves for certain environmental remediation matters and recognized greater employee related expenses 
these items were partially offset by the impact of goodwill amortization in consolidated net interest expense interest expense less interest income was million in  compared to million in and million in the lower net interest expense in  as compared to  and for compared to resulted from both lower borrowing levels and lower interest rates 
other expense was million in compared to million in and million in consolidated income tax expense of million  million  and million was recognized on the corporation s earnings from continuing operations before income taxes of million  million  and million  for   and  respectively 
the corporation s effective tax rate was for  compared to an effective tax rate of for  and for for  tax benefits of million were recognized on pre tax restructuring and exit costs of million  as compared to tax benefits of million on pre tax restructuring and exit costs of million in the corresponding period  and a million benefit on pre tax restructuring and exit costs of million in the corresponding period 
the higher effective tax rate during the period  as compared to the period  reflects the effect of the lower effective tax rate associated with the restructuring charge 
the lower effective tax rate during the period  as compared to the period  is primarily attributable to the amortization of non deductible goodwill in  offset by the effect of a higher effective tax rate associated with the restructuring charge 
a further analysis of taxes on earnings is included in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the corporation reported net earnings of million  million  and million  or   and per share on a diluted basis  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the increase in the corporation s net earnings and earnings per share for the period  as compared to  was partially attributable to the lower level of restructuring and exit costs recognized in the period 
net earnings for the year ended december   included million of goodwill amortization  of which million related to continuing operations and million related to discontinued operations 
no goodwill amortization is included in the or results due to a change in accounting standards 
in addition to the impact of the operational matters  earnings per share for  also benefited from lower shares outstanding 
business segments as more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the corporation operates in three reportable business segments power tools and accessories  hardware and home improvement  and fastening and assembly systems 
power tools and accessories segment sales and profit for the power tools and accessories segment  determined on the basis described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  were as follows in millions of dollars year ended december  sales to unaffiliated customers    segment profit sales to unaffiliated customers in the power tools and accessories segment during decreased from the level 
in north america  sales of power tools and accessories during decreased at a low single digit rate from the level due predominantly to a low single digit decrease in sales of the consumer power tools and accessories business 
strength in the north american professional power tools and accessories business in the second half of the year nearly offset declines during the first sixth months of sales of the consumer power tools and accessories business decreased at a low single digit rate from the level  as a double digit rate of growth in sales of outdoor products was more than offset by a double digit decline in sales of home products and a low single digit rate of decrease of sales of power tools and accessories as unfavorable price more than offset increased volume 
both the professional and consumer power tools and accessories businesses were negatively affected by customers actions to manage inventory levels during sales of power tools and accessories in europe during decreased at a mid single digit rate from the level  as sales of professional power tools and accessories decreased at a low single digit rate and sales of consumer power tools and accessories declined at a mid single digit rate 
sales were down across europe and in most product lines as weak economic conditions persisted during sales in other geographic areas increased at a high single digit rate in over the level  as higher sales were achieved in professional power tools and accessories  consumer power tools and accessories  and home products 
increases in sales occurred throughout south and central america  asia  and australia 
segment profit as a percentage of sales for the power tools and accessories segment was for as compared to for gross margin as a percentage of sales improved slightly as the positive effects of productivity initiatives  restructuring actions  and foreign currency rates were offset by the negative effects of pricing actions  promotional activities  and lower production levels 
during  the power tools and accessories segment reduced its production levels by approximately from the levels 
that reduction in production levels was primarily attributable to the efforts by the business to reduce its inventory levels 
as of december   the power tools and accessories segment decreased its total inventories  excluding the effects of foreign currency translation  by approximately from year end levels 
that decrease was in comparison to an approximate increase in total inventories  excluding the effects of foreign currency translation at december   over the year end levels 
selling  general  and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased slightly during as compared to as promotional and marketing expenses increased 
sales to unaffiliated customers in the power tools and accessories segment during increased over the level 
in north america  sales of consumer power tools and accessories and sales of professional power tools and accessories grew at a mid single digit rate 
the consumer business experienced double digit rates of growth in sales of both its outdoor and home products lines and a low single digit rate of growth in sales of consumer power tools 
both the consumer and professional businesses in north america benefited from promotional activities during sales of power tools and accessories in europe during decreased at a low single digit rate from the level 
that decrease resulted as a mid single digit rate of increase in sales of professional power tools and accessories was offset by a mid single digit rate of decline in sales of consumer products 
lower sales in germany and the united kingdom were partially offset by higher sales in most other european countries 
the sales declines in germany and the united kingdom were mainly driven by lower sales of consumer products  due to the exit of the lawnmower product line in the united kingdom and to the high level of private label asian sourced inventory held by retailers early in sales in other geographic areas increased at a mid single digit rate in over the levels as sales of professional power tools and accessories and consumer power tools and accessories increased at a mid single digit rate 
segment profit as a percentage of sales for the power tools and accessories segment was for compared to in the increase in segment profit as a percentage of sales during was driven by higher gross margins and by slightly lower selling  general  and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales 
the higher gross margins principally resulted from higher production levels in as compared to the lower levels experienced in the corresponding period in when the business took actions to reduce inventory levels  savings gained through six sigma initiatives and restructuring actions  more favorable product mix  and a decrease in warranty costs 
gross margins in were also depressed by price reductions taken by the business in order to reduce inventory levels 
segment profit as a percentage of sales during also increased due to the leverage of selling  general  and administrative expenses over the higher sales volume 
selling  general  and administrative expenses increased in over the levels due to increased marketing and promotional expenses and higher employee related costs  which were partially offset by restructuring and other cost reduction initiatives 
hardware and home improvement segment sales and profit for the hardware and home improvement segment  determined on the basis described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  were as follows in millions of dollars year ended december  sales to unaffiliated customers segment profit sales to unaffiliated customers in the hardware and home improvement segment in increased over the level 
this increase in sales was almost entirely due to the acquisition of baldwin hardware corporation baldwin and weiser lock corporation weiser from masco corporation early in the fourth quarter of a low single digit increase in sales of the kwikset security hardware business in north america was partially offset by a low single digit decrease in sales of plumbing products 
as a result of a line review in  the corporation s plumbing products business lost significant shelf space at the home depot stores in the central and eastern united states 
that loss of shelf space at the home depot negatively impacted plumbing product sales in by approximately million  but was partially offset in by an expansion of listings at lowe s home improvement warehouse lowe s during the second quarter of segment profit as a percentage of sales for the hardware and home improvement segment was for compared to for  mainly driven by improvements in gross margin as a percentage of sales 
productivity improvements and the results of restructuring actions were the primary factors that contributed to the increase in segment profit as a percentage of sales 
the increase in segment profit as a percentage of sales due to gross margin improvements was slightly offset by a one percentage point increase in selling  general  and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales in as compared to the level due to higher sales related expenses  including promotion  marketing  and salesmen s compensation 
the acquisition of baldwin and weiser did not have a significant effect on segment profit during sales to unaffiliated customers in the hardware and home improvement segment for approximated the level 
sales of security hardware in north america grew at a high single digit rate over the level due primarily to the success of the brand and product repositioning introduced in north american home centers in late and to other customers in that increase was offset by a double digit rate of decline in sales of plumbing products  due primarily to the effects of a loss of shelf space at the home depot and lower sales in non home center channels 
segment profit as a percentage of sales for the hardware and home improvement segment declined to in from in that decrease in segment profit as a percentage of sales was principally due to declines in gross margins which were only partially offset by lower selling  general  and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales 
those declines in gross margins resulted from lower production levels at north american security hardware and plumbing product plants  as those businesses took action to reduce inventory levels 
in addition  gross margins were negatively impacted by costs related to restructuring activities in the plumbing products business 
lower selling  general  and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales for principally resulted from restructuring actions that were taken in to reduce headcount and reduced promotional spending 
fastening and assembly systems segment sales and profit for the fastening and assembly systems segment  determined on the basis described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  were as follows in millions of dollars year ended december  sales to unaffiliated customers segment profit sales to unaffiliated customers in the fastening and assembly systems segment during increased slightly over the level as a mid single digit rate of increase in sales in europe and asia was substantially offset by a mid single digit rate decrease in sales in north america 
segment profit as a percentage of sales for the fastening and assembly systems segment was for as compared to during that decline was due to lower production volumes  resulting from weak industrial demand and lower automotive production  that were substantially offset by productivity improvements 
sales to unaffiliated customers in the fastening and assembly systems segment increased in over incremental sales associated with a distribution business acquired in april accounted for percentage points of the sales growth realized 
a double digit rate of increase in sales to automotive customers  including the effect of the business acquired in april  was partially offset by a mid single digit rate of decline in sales to industrial customers  particularly in europe 
segment profit as a percentage of sales for the fastening and assembly systems segment of in approximated the level 
other segment related matters as more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  in determining segment profit  expenses relating to pension and other postretirement benefits are based solely upon estimated service costs 
also  as more fully described in item under the caption financial condition  the corporation s expense recognized relating to its pension and other postretirement benefits plans in increased by approximately million over the levels 
the adjustment to businesses postretirement benefit expense booked in consolidation as identified in the second table included in note of notes to consolidated financial statements was income of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this decrease reflects the impact excluded from the corporation s reportable business segments 
expenses directly related to reportable business segments booked in consolidation and  thus  excluded from segment profit for the reportable business segments were million  million  and 
million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the million of segment related expenses excluded from segment profit in principally related to restructuring related expenses associated with the power tools and accessories segment of approximately million as well as certain reserves established relating to the power tools and accessories segment and the hardware and home improvement segment 
the million of segment related expenses excluded from segment profit in principally related to reserves for employee related matters associated with the power tools and accessories and hardware and home improvement segments 
amounts allocated to reportable business segments in arriving at segment profit were less than corporate center operating expenses  eliminations  and other amounts  as identified in the second table included in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  by million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the decrease in these unallocated corporate center operating expenses for as compared to was primarily due to lower medical related expenses in  reflecting the results of changes in plan design as well as higher expense allocations to the corporation s business segments  and lower reserves for certain legal and environmental remediation matters established in as compared to the increase in these unallocated corporate center operating expenses for as compared to was primarily due to an increase in reserves for certain environmental remediation matters and to higher employee related expenses  including certain centrally managed expenses not allocated directly to the corporation s business segments 
as indicated above and in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the determination of segment profit excludes restructuring and exit costs 
of the million pre tax restructuring charge recognized in  million related to the businesses in the power tools and accessories segment  and million related to the businesses in the hardware and home improvement segment

million  million  and 
million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
restructuring actions the corporation is committed to continuous productivity improvement and continues to evaluate opportunities to reduce fixed costs  simplify or improve processes  and eliminate excess capacity 
a tabular summary of restructuring activity during the three years ended december   is included in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
during the fourth quarter of  the corporation formulated a restructuring plan designed to reduce its manufacturing footprint  variable production costs  and selling  general  and administrative expenses 
the corporation initially anticipated that the cost of the total restructuring plan expected to be completed over a two to three year period would be million 
the million charge recognized by the corporation during represented the final pre tax charge associated with this restructuring plan 
that amount  coupled with restructuring charges recognized in connection with this plan in and  brought the total pre tax restructuring charge under this plan to million 
that million charge includes million relating to the corporation s european security hardware business that is reflected as discontinued operations 
the following discussion excludes the restructuring actions relating to the european security hardware business 
earnings from discontinued operations include pre tax restructuring reversals charges of 
million  million and 
million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
during  the corporation commenced the first phase of that restructuring plan and recorded a pre tax restructuring charge of million 
that million charge was net of million of reversals of previously provided restructuring reserves that were no longer required 
during  the corporation continued to execute its restructuring plans and recorded a pre tax restructuring charge of million 
that million charge was net of million of reversals of previously provided restructuring reserves that were no longer required and million  representing the excess of proceeds received on the sale of long lived assets  written down as part of restructuring actions  over their adjusted carrying values 
during  the corporation commenced the final phase of its restructuring plan and recorded a pre tax restructuring charge associated with that plan of million 
that million charge was net of million of reversals of previously provided restructuring reserves that were no longer required and million  representing the excess of proceeds received on the sale of long lived assets  written down as part of restructuring actions  over their adjusted carrying values 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of the corporation recorded a pre tax restructuring charge of million associated with the closure of a manufacturing facility in its hardware and home improvement segment as a result of the acquisition of baldwin and weiser 
the million pre tax restructuring charge recognized in reflects actions relating to the power tools and accessories segment to reduce its manufacturing cost base as well as actions to reduce selling  general  and administrative expenses through the elimination of administrative positions 
actions to reduce the corporation s manufacturing cost base in the power tools and accessories segment include the closure of one facility in the united states and the transfer of certain additional power tool production from a facility in the united states to a low cost facility in mexico 
the restructuring charge provided for actions to reduce selling  general  and administrative expenses  principally in europe  and to a lesser extent in the united states  principally reducing headcount 
the million pre tax restructuring charge recognized in reflected actions to reduce the corporation s manufacturing cost base in its power tools and accessories and hardware and home improvement segments  as well as actions to reduce selling  general  and administrative expenses through the elimination of administrative positions  principally in europe 
actions to reduce the corporation s manufacturing cost base in the power tools and accessories segment include the closure of one facility in the united states  the closure of an accessories packaging facility in england  and the transfer of certain additional power tool production from a facility in england to a low cost facility in the czech republic 
actions to reduce the corporation s manufacturing cost base in the hardware and home improvement segment include the closure of a security hardware facility in the united states 
the restructuring charge also includes pension curtailment losses stemming from headcount reductions associated with the restructuring actions 
the million pre tax restructuring charge recognized in reflected actions to reduce the corporation s manufacturing cost base in its power tools and accessories and hardware and home improvement segments  as well as actions to reduce selling  general  and administrative expenses throughout all of its businesses 
actions to reduce the corporation s manufacturing cost base included the closure of two facilities in the power tools and accessories segment in the united states as well as the closure by the hardware and home improvement segment of a plumbing products facility in the united states 
in addition  actions associated with the restructuring charge included the transfer of certain production and service operations in the power tools and accessories and hardware and home improvement segments from facilities in the united states and england to low cost facilities in mexico and china and to a new low cost facility in the czech republic 
in addition to these changes to the corporation s manufacturing footprint  the restructuring plan also provided for the outsourcing of certain manufactured items 
the restructuring charge provided for actions to reduce selling  general  and administrative expenses  principally in the united states and europe  including consolidation of certain distribution locations and other administrative functions  as well as reductions in selling and administrative headcount 
as indicated in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the severance benefits accrual  included in the million  million  and million pre tax restructuring charges taken in   and  respectively  related to the elimination of approximately  positions in high cost manufacturing locations and in certain administrative positions 
the corporation estimates that  as a result of increases in manufacturing employee headcount in low cost locations  approximately  replacement positions will be filled  yielding a net total of positions eliminated as a result of the   and restructuring actions 
the corporation anticipates that the execution of the restructuring actions associated with the restructuring plan that was formulated by the corporation in the fourth quarter of will be completed during the corporation anticipates that the closure of the manufacturing facility in its hardware and home improvement segment as a result of the acquisition of baldwin and weiser will be completed during given the nature and duration of this restructuring plan  the timing of the actions is subject to varying degrees of estimation associated with key assumptions  such as actual timing of execution  general economic conditions  and other variables 
in addition to the recognition of restructuring and exit costs  the corporation also recognizes related expenses  incremental to the cost of the underlying restructuring actions  that do not qualify as restructuring or exit costs under generally accepted accounting principles restructuring related expenses 
those restructuring related expenses include items directly related to the underlying restructuring actions that benefit ongoing operations  such as costs associated with the transfer of equipment 
operating results for the year ended december  and  included million and million  respectively  of restructuring related expenses 
the corporation realized benefits of approximately million and million in and  respectively  net of restructuring related expenses 
those benefits resulted in a reduction in cost of goods sold of approximately million and million in and  respectively  and a reduction in selling  general  and administrative expenses of approximately million and million in and  respectively 
the corporation expects that incremental pre tax savings associated with the restructuring plan that was formulated in the fourth quarter of will benefit and results  by million and million  respectively  net of restructuring related expenses 
the corporation expects that those incremental pre tax savings in and will benefit cost of goods sold and selling  general  and administrative expenses in approximately the same ratio as experienced in the corporation expects that pre tax savings associated with the restructuring actions associated with the integration of baldwin and weiser into its existing security hardware business will benefit and results by approximately million and million respectively  net of restructuring related expenses 
the restructuring related expense associated with these integration plans will have an adverse pre tax impact of approximately million in ultimate savings realized from restructuring actions may be mitigated by such factors as continued economic weakness and competitive pressures  as well as decisions to increase costs in areas such as promotion or research and development above levels that were otherwise assumed 
as previously indicated  the pre tax restructuring charges recognized in   and of million  million  and million  respectively  were net of reversals in   and of previously provided restructuring reserves that were no longer required and proceeds received in excess of the adjusted carrying value of long lived assets in the aggregate of million  million  and million  respectively 
adjustments to the severance component of restructuring reserves previously established related to i actual attrition factors that differed from those initially estimated  ii more cost effective methods of severing employment that became probable  typically based on negotiations with trade unions or local government institutions  and iii amendments to the initial plan that were approved by the appropriate level of management  based primarily on changes in market conditions that dictated a modification to the intended course of action 
during   and  none of the adjustments to the severance obligations recorded in connection with restructuring actions was individually significant 
adjustments to the asset write down component of restructuring reserves previously established related to the receipt of proceeds in excess of adjusted carrying values of fixed assets that were disposed of in connection with the restructuring actions 
adjustments to the other charge component of restructuring reserves previously established principally related to settlement of operating lease commitments at amounts less than initially estimated or the corporation s ability to sublease certain facilities exited as part of the restructuring actions 
asset write downs taken as part of the and restructuring charge included land  buildings  and manufacturing equipment 
asset write downs taken as part of the restructuring charge principally related to manufacturing equipment 
the carrying values of land and buildings to be sold were written down to their estimated fair values  generally based upon third party offers  less disposal costs 
the carrying values of manufacturing equipment and furniture and fixtures were written down to their fair value based upon estimated salvage values  which generally were negligible  less disposal cost 
in addition to the previously discussed restructuring actions  prior to the date of the acquisition of baldwin and weiser and during the fourth quarter of  the corporation identified opportunities to restructure these businesses as well as to integrate these businesses into the existing security hardware business included in the corporation s hardware and home improvement segment 
subsequent to the acquisition  the corporation approved restructuring actions relating to the acquired businesses of million 
these actions principally reflect severance benefits associated with administrative and manufacturing actions related to the acquired businesses  including the closure of an acquired administration and distribution facility 
the corporation anticipates that these restructuring actions will be completed in hedging activities the corporation has a number of manufacturing sites throughout the world and sells its products in more than countries 
as a result  it is exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various currencies against the united states dollar and against the currencies of countries in which it manufactures 
the major foreign currencies in which foreign currency risks exist are the euro  pound sterling  canadian dollar  swedish krona  japanese yen  chinese renminbi  australian dollar  mexican peso  czech koruna  and brazilian real 
through its foreign currency activities  the corporation seeks to reduce the risk that cash flows resulting from the sales of products manufactured in a currency different from that of the selling subsidiary will be affected by changes in exchange rates 
on january   the twelve participating member countries of the european monetary union canceled their respective legacy currencies which were replaced by the euro as legal tender 
the corporation believes that the introduction of the euro has resulted in increased competitive pressures in continental europe due to the heightened transparency of intra european pricing structures 
from time to time  currency devaluations may occur in countries in which the corporation sells or manufactures its product 
while the corporation will take actions to mitigate the impacts of any future currency devaluations  there is no assurance that such devaluations will not adversely affect the corporation 
assets and liabilities of subsidiaries located outside of the united states are translated at rates of exchange at the balance sheet date as more fully explained in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the resulting translation adjustments are included in the accumulated other comprehensive income loss component of stockholders equity 
during  translation adjustments  recorded in the accumulated other comprehensive income loss component of stockholders equity  increased stockholders equity by million compared to an increase of million in as more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the corporation seeks to issue debt opportunistically  whether at fixed or variable rates  at the lowest possible costs 
based upon its assessment of the future interest rate environment and its desired variable rate debt to total debt ratio  the corporation may elect to manage its interest rate risk associated with changes in the fair value of its indebtedness  or the cash flows of its indebtedness  through the use of interest rate swap agreements 
in order to meet its goal of fixing or limiting interest costs  the corporation maintains a portfolio of interest rate hedge instruments 
the variable rate debt to total debt ratio  after taking interest rate hedges into account  was at december   compared to at december   and at december  at december   average debt maturity was years compared to years at december   and years at december  interest rate sensitivity the following table provides information as of december   about the corporation s derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  including interest rate swaps and debt obligations 
for debt obligations  the table presents principal cash flows and related average interest rates by contractual maturity dates 
for interest rate swaps  the table presents notional principal amounts and weighted average interest rates by contractual maturity dates 
notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the interest rate swaps 
weighted average variable rates are generally based on the london interbank offered rate libor as of the reset dates 
the cash flows of these instruments are denominated in a variety of currencies 
unless otherwise indicated  the information is presented in us dollar equivalents  which is the corporation s reporting currency  as of december  principal payments and interest rate detail by contractual maturity dates fair value assets us dollars in millions thereafter total liabilities liabilities short term borrowings variable rate other currencies

foreign currency exchange rate sensitivity as discussed above  the corporation is exposed to market risks arising from changes in foreign exchange rates 
as of december   the corporation has hedged a portion of its estimated foreign currency transactions using forward exchange contracts 
the corporation estimated the effect on gross profits  based upon a recent estimate of foreign exchange exposures  of a uniform strengthening in the value of the united states dollar and a uniform weakening in the value of the united states dollar 
the larger loss computed was that under an assumed uniform strengthening of the united states dollar  which the corporation estimated would have the effect of reducing gross profits for by approximately million 
a uniform weakening in the value of the united states dollar would have the effect of increasing gross profits 
in addition to their direct effects  changes in exchange rates also affect sales volumes and foreign currency sales prices as competitors products become more or less attractive 
the sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates previously described does not reflect a potential change in sales levels or local currency prices nor does it reflect higher exchange rates  compared to those experienced during  inherent in the foreign exchange hedging portfolio at december  critical accounting policies the corporation s accounting policies are more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
as disclosed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates  and such differences may be material to the financial statements 
the corporation believes that of its significant accounting policies  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment  estimation  or complexity than other accounting policies 
as more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the corporation performs goodwill impairment tests on at least an annual basis and more frequently in certain circumstances 
the corporation cannot predict the occurrence of certain events that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill that totaled million at december  such events may include  but are not limited to  strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions  the impact of the economic environment on the corporation s customer base  or a material negative change in its relationships with significant customers 
pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts 
these assumptions include discount rates  expected return on plan assets  rates of salary increase  health care cost trend rates  mortality rates  and other factors 
these assumptions are updated on an annual basis prior to the beginning of each year 
the corporation considers current market conditions  including interest rates  in making these assumptions 
the corporation develops the discount rates by considering the yields available on high quality fixed income investments with long term maturities corresponding to the related benefit obligation 
the corporation lowered its discount rate for united states defined benefit pension plans from in to in as discussed further in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the corporation develops the expected return on plan assets by considering various factors  which include its targeted asset allocation percentages  historic returns  and expected future returns 
the corporation lowered its expected long term rate of return assumption for united states defined benefit pension plans from in to in the corporation believes that the assumptions used are appropriate  however  differences in actual experience or changes in the assumptions may materially affect the corporation s financial position or results of operations 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  actual results that differ from the actuarial assumptions are accumulated and  if in excess of a specified corridor  amortized over future periods and  therefore  generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods 
the expected return on plan assets is determined using the expected rate of return and a calculated value of assets referred to as the market related value of assets 
the corporation s aggregate market related value of assets exceeded the fair value of plan assets by approximately million as of the measurement date 
differences between assumed and actual returns are amortized to the market related value on a straight line basis over a five year period 
also  gains and losses resulting from changes in assumptions and from differences between assumptions and actual experience except those differences being amortized to the market related value of assets are amortized over the expected remaining service period of active plan participants or  for retired participants  the average remaining life expectancy  to the extent that such amounts exceed ten percent of the greater of the market related value of plan assets or the projected benefit obligation at the beginning of the year 
the corporation expects that its pension and other postretirement benefit costs in will exceed the costs recognized in by approximately million 
this increase is principally attributable to two factors a reduction in the market related value of pension plan assets  as compared to the prior year  and the effect of amortization of certain actuarial losses 
as more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the corporation recognized pre tax restructuring charges of million  million  and million during   and  respectively 
those pre tax restructuring charges in   and were net of reversals of previously established pre tax restructuring reserves and proceeds received in excess of the adjusted carrying value of long lived assets in the aggregate of million  million  and million  respectively 
the related restructuring reserves reflect estimates  including those pertaining to separation costs  settlements of contractual obligations  and asset valuations 
the corporation reassesses the reserve requirements to complete each individual plan within the restructuring program at the end of each reporting period 
actual experience has been and may continue to be different from the estimates used to establish the restructuring reserves 
at december   the corporation had liabilities established in conjunction with its restructuring activities that totaled million 
as more fully described in item of this report  the corporation is subject to various legal proceedings and claims  including those with respect to environmental matters  the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty 
the corporation evaluates  among other factors  the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome  the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss  and in certain instances  the ability of other parties to share costs 
also  in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states when a range of probable loss exists  the corporation accrues at the low end of the range when no other more likely amount exists 
unanticipated events or changes in these factors may require the corporation to increase the amount it has accrued for any matter or accrue for a matter that has not been previously accrued because it was not probable 
selling  general  and administrative expenses in increased by approximately million over the prior year level due to increased environmental and legal expenses associated with changes in various factors related to matters for which reserves had previously been established as well as to matters which arose during further  as indicated in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  insurance recoveries for environmental and certain general liability claims have not been recognized until realized 
any insurance recoveries  if realized in future periods  could have a favorable impact on the corporation s financial condition or results of operations in the periods realized 
the corporation is also subject to income tax laws in many countries 
judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the corporation s financial statements or tax returns 
during  the corporation expects that taxing authorities may complete tax audits currently underway in two significant countries 
the final outcome of these future tax consequences  tax audits  and changes in regulatory tax laws and rates could materially impact the corporation s financial statements 
during  the corporation received notices of proposed adjustments from the united states internal revenue service irs in connection with audits of the tax years through the principal adjustment proposed by the irs consists of the disallowance of a capital loss deduction taken in the corporation s tax returns 
the corporation intends to vigorously dispute the position taken by the irs in this matter 
the corporation has provided adequate reserves in the event that the irs prevails in its disallowance of the previously described capital loss and the imposition of related interest 
should the irs prevail in its disallowance of the capital loss deduction and imposition of related interest  it would result in a cash outflow by the corporation of approximately million 
the corporation believes that any such cash outflow is unlikely to occur until some time after impact of new accounting standards as more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the corporation has not yet adopted the financial accounting standards board staff position no

the increase in cash provided by operating activities in over the levels was primarily the result of lower inventory levels and higher earnings 
the favorable factors were partially offset by higher trade receivables associated with increased sales in as compared to as part of its capital management  the corporation reviews certain working capital metrics 
for example  the corporation evaluates its accounts receivable and inventory levels through the computation of days sales outstanding and inventory turnover ratio  respectively 
the number of days sales outstanding as of december   approximated the number of days sales outstanding as of december  average inventory turns during approximated the level

financing activities used cash of million in  compared to cash used of million in the increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily the result of higher payments on long term debt  including million of debt that was repaid on april   and cash used for stock repurchases during the period 
during and  the corporation repurchased  and  shares of its common stock at an aggregate cost of million and million  respectively 
during  the corporation repurchased  shares of its common stock at an aggregate cost of million upon the termination of its equity forward purchase agreements  as more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  and also repurchased  shares of its common stock at an aggregate cost of million 
the corporation implemented its share repurchase program based upon the belief that its shares were undervalued and to manage share growth resulting from option exercises 
at december   the corporation had remaining authorization from its board of directors to repurchase an additional  shares of its common stock 
during the fourth quarter of  the corporation announced that its board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 
per share of the corporation s outstanding common stock payable during the fourth quarter of this amount represents a increase over the 
quarterly dividend paid by the corporation since future dividends will depend on the corporation s earnings  financial condition  and other factors

 employer s accounting for pensions  the corporation has recorded a minimum pension liability adjustment at december  as a charge to stockholders equity of million  net of tax 
that charge to stockholders equity did not impact the corporation s compliance with covenants under its borrowing agreements or cash flow 
the corporation s expense recognized relating to its pension and other postretirement benefit plans increased by approximately million in over the levels 
the corporation anticipates that the expense recognized relating to its pension and other postretirement benefit plans in will increase by approximately million over the levels 
that increase is partially attributable to the amortization of previously unrecognized actuarial losses that gave rise to the minimum liability adjustment 
as discussed further in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the corporation does not anticipate that the funding requirements relating to the pension benefit plans in will be material

the corporation has provided adequate reserves in the event that the irs prevails in its disallowance of the previously described capital loss and the imposition of related interest 
should the irs prevail in its disallowance of the capital loss deduction and imposition of related interest  it would result in a cash outflow by the corporation of approximately million 
the corporation believes that any such cash outflow is unlikely to occur until some time after the ongoing costs of compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations have not had  and are not expected to have  a material adverse effect on the corporation s capital expenditures or financial position 
the corporation will continue to have cash requirements to support seasonal working capital needs and capital expenditures  to pay interest  to service debt  and to complete the restructuring actions previously described 
for amounts available at december   under the corporation s revolving credit facilities and under short term borrowing facilities  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements
