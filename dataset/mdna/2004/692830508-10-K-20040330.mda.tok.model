overview the company s consolidated revenues for the twelve months ended december  increased  from  to  although revenues increased at all subsidiaries  the greatest increase was at countrywide  resulting primarily from the inclusion of the acquisition of nationwide for a full twelve months of as opposed to only eight months in and to a significant increase in sales in the fencing product line 
overall gross profit decreased slightly as the increased volume  which typically improves margins  was more than offset by a less favorable product mix and the increase in cost of imported product due to the weakening of the us dollar versus both the yen and euro 
profits improved overall  when comparing income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  from  to  key indicators economic measures key economic measures relevant to the company include the cost of metals  especially various types of steel  aluminum and copper 
also important is the value of the dollar in relation to the japanese yen  the new taiwan dollar and  to a lesser extent  the euro  as the company spends approximately million in these currencies annually 
key elements for the demand for the company s products include retail sales  housing starts  especially in the northeast and south  and the demand for capital goods 
at the end of  the company experienced an increase in the cost of most types of steel and aluminum and products predominantly comprised of steel 
this was first attributed to the tariffs imposed on imported steel  but more recently has been driven by excess demand in asia 
most tariffs appear to have eased and  thus  should not impact the cost of steel going forward  however  it is unclear if or when the demand driven price increase will dissipate 
during  the value of the us dollar decreased in relation to both the euro and the japanese yen 
the decrease in the value of the dollar was approximately in relation to the euro and approximately in relation to the yen 
the net weakening of the us dollar against both the euro and the yen in resulted in an increase in the cost of imported product from japan and europe of approximately  although there can be no certainty  the company does not expect rates to return to the early levels in the next year 
in  retail sales improved over  and strong housing demand continued in the south 
housing demand in the northeast remained sluggish 
the demand for capital goods improved slightly in any change in the trend for these indicators in will have an impact on results

critical accounting policies and estimates the company prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
certain of these accounting policies require the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventory reserves  goodwill and intangible assets 
the company bases its estimates on historical data and experience  when available  and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the combined results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
the company s critical accounting policies include allowance for doubtful accounts senior management reviews accounts receivable on a monthly basis to determine if any receivables will potentially be uncollectible 
analysis of customer history  financial data and the overall economic environment are performed 
in addition  any balance outstanding for more than days is compared to the accounts receivable reserve for adequacy 
collection agencies are also utilized 
the company records an allowance for doubtful accounts based on specifically identified amounts that are believed to be uncollectible 
the company also records as an additional allowance a certain percentage of aged accounts receivable  based on historical experience and the company s assessment of the general financial conditions affecting its customer base 
if actual collection experience changes  revisions to the allowance may be required 
the company has a limited number of customers with individually large amounts due at any given balance sheet date 
any unanticipated change in the credit worthiness of any of these customers could have a material affect on the company s results of operations in the period in which such changes or events occur 
after all reasonable attempts to collect an account receivable have failed  the amount of the receivable is written off against the allowance 
based on the information available  the company believes that its allowance for doubtful accounts as of december  was adequate 
however  actual write offs might exceed the recorded allowance 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined by the first in  first out method 
the inventory balance  which includes materials  labor and manufacturing overhead costs  is recorded net of an allowance for obsolete or unmarketable inventory 
such allowance is based upon both historical experience and management s understanding of market conditions and forecasts of future product demand 
in addition  items in inventory in excess of one year s usage are compared to the allowance for adequacy 
if the actual amount of obsolete or unmarketable inventory significantly exceeds the estimated allowance  the company s cost of sales  gross profit and net income would be significantly affected 
goodwill and other intangible assets the company s operational policy for the assessment and measurement of any impairment in the value of goodwill and other intangible assets that is other than temporary is to evaluate at least annually  with the help of independent third party appraisals  the recoverability and remaining life of its goodwill and other intangible assets to determine their fair value 
the methodologies to be used to estimate fair value include the use of estimates and assumptions  including projected revenues  earnings and cash flows 
if the fair value of any of these assets is determined to be less than its carrying value  the company will reflect the impairment of any such assets through a reduction in its carrying value  in an amount equal to the excess of the carrying value of the asset over its appraised value 
on a quarterly basis  the company reviews changes in market conditions  among other factors  that could have a material impact on its estimates of fair value in order to reassess the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets 
at december   no adjustment for impairment was deemed necessary 
impairment of goodwill in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  which requires that goodwill not be amortized  but tested annually for impairment 
the company adopted sfas as of january  and  in accordance therewith  ceased amortizing its goodwill as of that date 
the company had its goodwill tested for impairment  effective january   during the second quarter of the impairment tests performed required that the company determine the fair market value of its reporting units for comparison to the carrying value of their net assets to assess whether any impairment existed 
the methodologies used to estimate fair market value involved the use of estimates and assumptions  including projected revenues  earnings and cash flows 
the company s earnings forecast for green  which reflected the extremely weak market conditions in the hydraulic cylinder business  resulted in the fair market value of green s goodwill  as determined by an independent third party appraiser  being lower than its carrying value as of december  accordingly  in the quarter ended june   the company recorded  retroactive to january   an after tax impairment charge of approximately million  which is reported as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle resulting from the adoption of sfas the company s annual impairment test done as of november  indicated that the fair values exceeded the carrying amounts
