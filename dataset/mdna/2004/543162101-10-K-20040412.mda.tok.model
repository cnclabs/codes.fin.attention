item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes 
this discussion contains forward looking statements based upon our current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties  such as our plans  objectives  expectations and intentions  as set forth under cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements 
our actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including  but not limited to  those set forth in the following discussion and under risk factors and elsewhere in this form k 
overview fiscal brought continued change  with new challenges and opportunities for longs 
the economy continues to be sluggish and unemployment remains high  particularly in california  our primary market 
a budget crisis and the recall of the state s governor have fueled an environment of political and economic uncertainty in the state of california 
additionally  the competitive landscape is changing in many of the markets in which we do business 
other large retail drug store chains and mass merchandisers are expanding in our markets  and we are facing increased competition from non traditional channels such as the internet and mail order pharmacies 
in this economic environment  we are undertaking significant organizational and operational changes 
these changes affect our store operations  merchandising and marketing strategies  information technology systems  compensation arrangements  and senior management organizational structure and responsibilities 
in a difficult and uncertain economy  and a highly competitive market  we believe these changes are necessary to become a stronger competitor and build a foundation for profitable long term growth 
in february  our board of directors approved five strategic initiatives for our company  as follows enhance customer service improve pharmacy profitability increase front end sales upgrade our supply chain improve operational processes we have also undertaken numerous other initiatives and programs to support these five broad strategic initiatives in february  we reduced our administrative workforce by approximately people in our california offices 
this workforce reduction resulted in a more streamlined administrative support organization and has contributed to a reduction in operating and administrative expenses relative to our sales 
we are taking a series of steps to improve the cash flow performance of underperforming stores and of stores opened during the last three years 
the cash flow for these stores as a group improved in fiscal compared to fiscal we closed one of these stores during the fourth quarter and are continuing to monitor the performance of the remaining stores 
we phased out several inefficient technology systems and replaced them with more efficient and reliable systems 
our systems upgrades included the rollout of a higher performance pharmacy processing system  a new point of sale system and hand held wireless systems in all of our stores 
in addition  we continued to make substantial systems changes related to upgrading our supply chain 

table of contents these changes included the implementation of a new distribution management system in our northern california front end distribution center and preliminary testing of a new price and cost file maintenance system for our stores 
we expect  over the next two years  to complete the rollout of these systems at our remaining stores and distribution centers  and implement a perpetual inventory system and improved purchasing systems that will facilitate store replenishments and improve our visibility into inventories and gross profits on a real time basis 
our lack of real time visibility into our inventory and gross profits reduces our ability to make intra period adjustments to improve our operating performance 
upon the successful upgrade of our supply chain  including the implementation of a perpetual inventory system  we expect to be able to make more timely decisions about purchasing activities  inventory levels  promotional efforts and other factors that affect our gross profits 
we implemented workflow and staffing changes in our stores in order to improve customer service and reduce operating and administrative expenses 
we plan to continue the installation of time and attendance  labor scheduling and labor forecasting in our stores in fiscal we closed three administrative support facilities and relocated a fourth  further contributing to the reduction of our operating and administrative expenses during the year 
we centralized the procurement of office and store supplies and equipment  resulting in a reduction of supply expenses 
we took several steps to improve our pharmacy profitability  including increasing automation through the utilization of robotics in our stores  enhancing our central prescription fill center capabilities  increasing the centralization of our pharmacy purchasing and acquiring a mail order pharmacy 
we plan to continue our efforts to improve pharmacy productivity and profitability in fiscal we reduced the time and cost to merchandise new stores and prepare them for opening 
we remodeled stores during fiscal  and we plan to remodel up to additional stores in fiscal we are still assessing the effects of these remodels on our sales and profitability 
we modified our merchandise assortments as part of our centralized merchandise strategy  reducing inventories in our non core categories while increasing inventories in our core merchandise categories 
we plan to continue these efforts in fiscal we reduced prices on more than  high volume items in core categories to increase our competitiveness 
we plan to reduce our working capital by million on an equivalent store basis during fiscal more effective and efficient management of working capital is intended to provide increased operating cash flow for other purposes  such as capital expenditures  debt repayments  dividends or stock repurchases 
we adjusted our incentive compensation arrangements throughout the company to better align incentive pay with performance 
we reduced the number of work related accidents during fiscal  and we intend to continue to improve our safety record in an effort to preserve the health and welfare of our employees and reduce our workers compensation costs 
we expect continued economic sluggishness and intense competitive activity in our markets in fiscal we also expect legislative actions in the state of california surrounding medi cal and workers compensation prescription reimbursement rates and workers compensation insurance reform all at levels that are difficult to predict 
we plan to continue to make significant changes to our operations under our five strategic initiatives in an effort to strengthen our competitive position while improving our profitability and long term growth prospects

growth in revenues at rxamerica  our pharmacy benefit management  or pbm subsidiary  contributed the remaining of total sales growth 
on october   union workers initiated a strike against three major grocery chains in southern california  resulting in increased sales in some of our southern california stores 
we estimate that the strike increased our fiscal same store sales by to percentage points  resulting in an estimated earnings increase of to per diluted share 
pharmacy sales increased in fiscal over fiscal  with same store pharmacy sales increasing 
pharmacy sales were of total retail drug store sales in fiscal  compared to in fiscal we expect pharmacy sales to continue to increase as a percentage of total retail drug store sales as pharmacy sales continue to increase faster than front end sales 
we expect our pharmacy sales to continue to increase as a result of favorable industry trends  such as an aging us population consuming a greater number of prescription drugs  the increased usage of newer and more expensive drugs and increasing consumer awareness of the introduction of new drugs due to pharmaceutical manufacturers direct to consumer marketing efforts 
the increase in same store pharmacy sales was primarily driven by a increase in the average retail price per prescription over fiscal we expect that average retail prices for prescription drugs will continue to rise due to the continued introduction and usage of newer and more expensive drugs 
this has been offset in part by the increased utilization of low priced  high volume generic drugs 
same store prescription volumes in fiscal were down from last year 
the conversion of the allergy drug claritin from prescription to over the counter status in december negatively impacted prescription volumes 
this effect on comparable period volumes ended in the fourth quarter of fiscal after we reached the anniversary of claritin s conversion from prescription status 
health concerns over hormone replacement therapy drugs as well as continued sluggish economic growth also had a negative impact on prescription volumes 

table of contents third party health plans covered of our pharmacy sales in fiscal  compared to last year 
we expect third party sales to remain at or near of our total pharmacy sales for the foreseeable future due to significant consumer participation in managed care and other third party plans 
front end sales decreased in fiscal from last year  with same store front end sales decreasing 
several factors contributed to the decline in our front end sales economic weakness and high unemployment  particularly in california  continued to adversely affect our front end sales 
we have experienced a decline in sales in our photo category  primarily due to consumers continued migration to digital photography technology 
in response to this technology migration  we recently completed the installation of digital photo technology systems in more than of our stores 
during the year  we reduced prices on over  high volume items in core categories such as over the counter medications  health and beauty care and convenience grocery items in order to better align our pricing and improve our competitive position 
we experienced some disruption to our supply chain  which adversely impacted our front end sales  due to the implementation of a new distribution management system in our northern california distribution center 
the war in iraq adversely affected consumer spending in our first fiscal quarter  resulting in a negative impact on our front end sales 
we are taking several actions as part of our initiatives to increase our front end sales in a difficult economic environment and highly competitive market 
these actions include the following we are establishing a centralized front end merchandising strategy and are changing our merchandise offerings and assortments  resulting in a reduction of non core merchandise and an increase in core merchandise inventories 
we reduced non core merchandise inventories in our stores by approximately million in fiscal we have enhanced our promotional efforts  increased promotional sales  and reduced prices on over  high volume items in core categories to strengthen our competitive position 
we will continue to make decisions about promotional efforts and price changes based on competitive and economic conditions  but we expect that our promotional sales will continue to be a driver of our total front end sales in light of persistent softness in the economy and promotional activities by our competitors 
additionally  the grocery strike in southern california ended in march  and we expect the affected grocery chains to increase their promotional activities in an effort to regain lost customers and increase their sales 
we have significantly expanded our digital photo service capabilities through the installation of digital photo technology systems in more than of our stores 
as a result  our photo sales trends improved during the fourth quarter of fiscal  compared with the previous two quarters 
we plan to open to new stores during fiscal  and remodel up to stores 
fiscal versus fiscal sales increased in fiscal over fiscal fiscal included weeks of operations compared to weeks in fiscal  resulting in a negative impact of percentage points on sales growth in fiscal compared to same store sales  on a comparative week basis  increased  and new stores accounted for an increase of 
our september acquisition of full ownership of rxamerica contributed the remaining of total sales growth in fiscal prior to the acquisition  rxamerica was a joint venture between longs and albertson s  inc  and we accounted for our interest in the joint venture using the equity method of accounting 

table of contents pharmacy sales increased in fiscal  with same store pharmacy sales increasing 
pharmacy sales were of total drug store sales in fiscal  compared to in fiscal our pharmacy sales increased as a result of favorable industry trends  including an aging us population and the increased usage of newer and more expensive prescription drugs 
sluggish economic growth and increased competition resulted in a decrease in our same store prescriptions in fiscal however  the average retail price per prescription increased 
increased utilization of lower priced  high volume generic drugs negatively impacted same store pharmacy sales by approximately in fiscal front end sales increased in fiscal  with same store front end sales increasing 
the increase in same store front end sales in fiscal was primarily due to increased promotional sales resulting from a refocused and event driven advertising and marketing campaign 
front end sales were adversely affected by sluggish economic growth in our primary markets  particularly in california  and increased competition from mass merchants  national drug store chains and supermarkets 
we also experienced a weak holiday shopping season and a mild cold and flu season that resulted in lower over the counter drug sales 
gross profit fiscal year gross profit thousands gross profit lifo provision thousands fiscal versus fiscal gross profit was of sales in fiscal  compared to in fiscal several factors contributed to the decline in our gross profit percentage we increased markdowns to reduce merchandise inventories in our non core categories  such as seasonal items  gift  garden and sporting goods 
as a result of these efforts  inventories in our non core categories decreased by million during fiscal we experienced higher distribution costs relative to our sales as a result of the implementation of a new distribution management system in our northern california distribution center and higher than anticipated volume in our southern california distribution center due to the grocery strike 
we incurred higher merchandise costs by making increased purchases outside of our centralized processes in an effort to remain in stock during the grocery strike and system conversion 
approximately of our pharmacy sales are wholly or partially reimbursed by third party health plans  which have lower gross profit percentages than non third party sales 
third party health plans continue to reduce reimbursements for the prescription drugs provided to their members  resulting in pressure on pharmacy gross profits 
recently  the california state budget included a proposed reduction in medi cal reimbursements to health care providers including pharmacies effective july in addition  effective january   reimbursement rates for california workers compensation prescriptions were tied to medi cal reimbursement rates 
combined  workers compensation and medi cal prescriptions represent approximately of our pharmacy sales 
changes to the reimbursement rate could impact our pharmacy sales and gross profits  the extent of which depends on the nature and effective date of the changes and our ability to offset the impact of medi cal sales by recruiting other third party prescription plans 

table of contents pharmacy sales have lower gross profit percentages than front end sales  and as pharmacy sales continue to grow as a percent of total sales  overall gross profit percentages continue to be adversely impacted 
our promotional sales increased as a percentage of total front end sales in fiscal over fiscal promotional sales have lower gross profit percentages than non promotional sales 
we expect that our promotional sales will continue to be a significant portion of our total front end sales in light of persistent softness in the economy and promotional activities by our competitors  resulting in pressure on our front end gross profits 
we reduced prices on more than  high volume items in categories such as health and beauty care  over the counter medications and convenience grocery in order to better align our prices and improve our competitive position 
more disciplined purchasing and economies of scale resulting from our progress in centralizing procurement  advertising and promotional activities as part of our initiative to upgrade our supply chain practices partially offset the decline in our gross profit 
our gross profit included lifo provisions  which are included in cost of sales  of million in fiscal and million in fiscal the decrease in the lifo provision  which had a positive impact on our gross profit as a percentage of sales  is primarily due to lower overall net inflation on our front end merchandise costs during the year 
the lifo provision fluctuates with inflation rates  inventory levels and merchandise mix 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we began classifying advertising expenses as a component of cost of sales 
previously  we classified advertising expense as a component of operating and administrative expenses 
we reclassified results for fiscal to conform to this new presentation  resulting in a million increase in cost of sales and an offsetting decrease in previously reported operating and administrative expenses  with no effect on reported net income 
in addition to the acquisition cost of inventory sold net of merchandise rebates and allowances  we include in bound freight  receiving  warehousing  purchasing and distribution costs  and advertising expenses net of advertising rebates and allowances in our cost of sales 
our gross profit percentages may not be comparable to those of some other retailers who include distribution and advertising costs in their operating expenses 
fiscal versus fiscal gross profit was of sales in fiscal  compared to in fiscal almost half of the increase was attributable to the inclusion of rxamerica s gross profit in our consolidated total 
we recognize in our consolidated sales rxamerica s revenues from third party health plans net of the related reimbursements due to participating pharmacies 
we do not record any of rxamerica s expenses in cost of sales 
therefore  all of rxamerica s net revenues million in fiscal and million in fiscal are included in gross profit 
prior to our acquisition of ownership of rxamerica in september  it was a joint venture between longs and albertson s  inc  and we recorded our share of its profits in operating and administrative expenses using the equity method of accounting 
the increased usage of generic drugs  which have higher gross profit percentages than name brand drugs  also favorably affected our gross profit percentage 
pricing pressure from third party health plans and increased promotional sales adversely affected our gross profits in fiscal  and partially offset these favorable effects 
gross profit in fiscal included a lifo provision of million  compared to million in fiscal  included in cost of sales 
the lifo provision fluctuates with inflation rates  inventory levels and merchandise mix 
the decrease in the lifo provision in fiscal  which had a positive impact on our gross profit as a percent of sales  was primarily due to lower inflation rates in our front end categories 

table of contents operating and administrative expenses fiscal year operating and administrative expenses thousands operating and administrative expenses as a percent of sales fiscal versus fiscal operating and administrative expenses were of sales in fiscal  compared to in fiscal a decrease in labor costs and related benefit costs reduced our operating and administrative expense rate by of sales 
this decrease was the result of a series of steps we took during the fiscal year to improve our productivity and reduce our costs 
these steps included a reduction of our administrative workforce by approximately people in our california offices  the closure of certain support facilities  store labor savings through workflow and staffing changes  modifications to many of our incentive compensation arrangements and the voluntary separation program for store managers announced in july these actions resulted in lower operating and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales compared to fiscal beginning in the second half of fiscal  and we expect this trend to continue in the first half of fiscal operating and administrative expenses for fiscal also benefited from net gains of million of sales on the disposition of properties 
in connection with the reduction of our administrative workforce  closure of facilities and the voluntary separation program for store managers we recorded charges totaling million  or of sales  in operating and administrative expenses for employee termination  facility closure and other related costs 
workers compensation and other insurance related expenses increased million  or of sales  in fiscal over fiscal we are self insured for a substantial portion of our workers compensation and general liability costs 
the increase in our insurance related expenses during fiscal included a million net increase in our self insurance reserves based on a third party actuarial study of our self insured programs and reserves  particularly workers compensation  in the fourth quarter 
insurance costs across industries have increased significantly over the last two years as a result of rising health care costs  legislative and regulatory changes  economic conditions and terrorism 
the california state legislature is currently considering changes to the state s workers compensation laws in an effort to reduce costs  and we cannot predict the outcome of such deliberations 
however  we are continuing to develop our existing workplace safety practices in an effort to partially mitigate this increase in costs over time by reducing the number of work related injuries 
fiscal versus fiscal operating and administrative expenses were of sales in fiscal  compared to in fiscal several factors contributed to the increase 
we included rxamerica s operating and administrative expenses of approximately million  or of sales  in our consolidated totals for all of fiscal prior to our acquisition of ownership of rxamerica in september  it was a joint venture between longs and albertson s  inc  and we recorded our share of its profits in operating and administrative expenses using the equity method of accounting 
these equity method profits were not material to us 
we incurred operating and administrative expenses of million  or of sales  in fiscal related to the supply chain initiative  which began in february workers compensation expenses increased million  or of sales  in fiscal the increase was a result of a revaluation of our reserves for outstanding claims to reflect regulatory changes in our principal markets and lower interest rates used to discount our liability 
as previously noted  the increased usage of lower priced generic drugs had a negative impact on our sales 
this in turn resulted in higher operating and administrative expenses when measured as a percent of sales  but 
table of contents increased gross profit margins 
we estimate that the higher generic utilization resulted in an increase of approximately in operating expenses as a percent of sales 
other elements of the increase in operating and administrative expenses include costs for certain consulting projects relating to strategic  operational and tax initiatives  employee terminations and increased debit and credit card processing fees 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expenses were million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal the increase of million was primarily due to accelerated depreciation of million in the first six months of fiscal arising from the abandonment of a pharmacy processing system 
depreciation and amortization expenses were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal effective with the first quarter of fiscal  we no longer record amortization expense for goodwill and certain other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives  in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
amortization for these assets was million in fiscal excluding discontinued amortization  depreciation and amortization increased by million in fiscal over fiscal  primarily due to increased depreciation expense resulting from capital expenditures for new store investments  improvements to existing stores  supply chain improvements and technology 
provision benefit for store closures and asset impairments the provision benefit for store closures and asset impairments is summarized as follows fiscal year thousands provision benefit for store closures  net asset impairments total store closures the following is a summary of the provision benefit for store closures and related reserves  which are included in long term liabilities fiscal year thousands reserve balance beginning of year provision for present value of noncancellable lease obligations of stores closed  net of estimated sublease income changes in assumptions about future sublease income and other lease related costs employee termination costs total provision benefit for store closures  net cash payments for lease related costs  net of sublease income reserve balance end of year we periodically review store operating results and projections and make decisions to close stores in the normal course of business 
we recognize costs associated with store closures when the related liabilities are 
table of contents incurred 
in fiscal  we closed stores and recorded a provision for the present value of noncancellable lease payments  net of estimated future sublease income  of million 
in addition  we recorded a provision of million related to changes in our assumptions about estimated future sublease income for previously closed stores 
in fiscal  we closed stores and recorded a provision of million related to changes in our assumptions about estimated future sublease income for previously closed stores 
in fiscal  we closed stores  of which were closed pursuant to a store closure plan approved by our board of directors in january closure plan 
we also recorded a provision in fiscal for employee termination costs of million related to the stores included in the closure plan 
based on the results of store closure activities in fiscal and resulting changes in assumptions about estimated future costs  net of estimated future sublease income  we recorded a benefit of million for the reduction of the reserve for store closures in fiscal our calculation of store closure costs includes significant estimates about the amounts and timing of future sublease income 
these estimates are based on our historical experience  the condition and location of the properties  the lease terms and current real estate leasing market conditions 
many of our previously closed stores have long remaining lease terms  with the longest lease term ending january as a result  changes in these assumptions can significantly impact our store closure reserves 
asset impairments in each of the last three fiscal years  we have identified certain underperforming stores with assets whose carrying values exceeded their related undiscounted expected future cash flows 
accordingly  in fiscal  we recorded impairment charges of million to write down such assets to their estimated fair values 
also during fiscal  we recorded a provision of million for asset impairments related to the write off of abandoned information technology assets as well as impairments of million related to the long lived assets of the stores we closed during the year 
in fiscal  we recorded million of impairment charges for underperforming stores to write down the related assets to their estimated fair values 
also in fiscal  we abandoned a targeted marketing database that was originally developed as a component of our e retail strategy and recorded an impairment charge of million to write off the remaining net book value of this database 
in fiscal  we recorded impairment charges for underperforming stores of million to write down the related assets to their estimated fair values 
legal settlements and other disputes in fiscal  we recorded a combined benefit of million related to settlements of a lease related dispute with one of our landlords and a contract dispute with a former service provider 
in fiscal  we recorded a net charge of million for the settlement of certain legal matters 
the fiscal matters were settled in earlier fiscal years  and as final payments were made during fiscal  we incurred additional costs over those previously estimated 
in fiscal  we recorded a net charge of million for the settlement of a lease related dispute with a landlord  partially offset by gains on the settlement of other disputes 
net interest expense net interest expense was million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal the increase from fiscal to fiscal was due to higher average borrowings  partially offset by increased interest capitalization on current construction and systems projects 
the decrease from fiscal to fiscal was due to lower average borrowings and interest rates 

table of contents income taxes our effective income tax rates were  and in fiscal  and the lower tax rate in fiscal was primarily due to the benefits of wage and other tax credits  which reduced our effective income tax rate by percentage points 
we expect that our effective income tax rate will be approximately in fiscal cumulative effect of accounting change as a result of adopting sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of million million after tax or per diluted share in fiscal as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
liquidity and capital resources general our primary sources of liquidity are operating cash flows and borrowings on our line of credit 
we use cash to provide working capital for our operations  finance capital expenditures and acquisitions  repay debt  pay dividends and repurchase shares of our common stock 
we have an unsecured revolving line of credit with a syndication of banks  which expires in october and accrues interest at libor based rates 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we exercised an option to increase the borrowing capacity of this credit facility  resulting in a million increase in our total borrowing and letter of credit capacity from million to million 
borrowings on the line of credit do not require repayment until the october expiration date 
as of january   borrowings of million were outstanding under this line of credit with a weighted average interest rate of 
we also had million in letters of credit outstanding under the line of credit as of january  we have classified all borrowings under the line of credit as current liabilities as of january  because of the october expiration date 
however  we intend to renew or replace the line of credit prior to its expiration 
additionally  as of january  we had million in outstanding unsecured privately placed promissory notes 
these notes mature at various dates through and bear interest at fixed rates ranging from to 
the notes include penalties for repayment prior to their scheduled maturities 
included in the current maturities of long term debt as of january  are million of regularly scheduled principal payments  the majority of which are due in the fourth quarter of fiscal it is likely that we will refinance all or a portion of the current maturities of the private placement notes 
our debt agreements contain limits on borrowings and repurchases of company stock  and various quarterly financial covenants that set maximum leverage ratios and minimum fixed charge and asset coverage ratios 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we amended our unsecured revolving line of credit agreement to revise certain financial covenants and limitations and increase our maximum allowable repurchases of company stock 
as of january   we were in compliance with the restrictions and limitations included in these provisions 
failure to comply with all of our debt covenants could adversely affect our ability to manage our cash requirements  as well as result in higher interest costs and potentially accelerated repayment requirements 
we believe that cash on hand  together with cash provided by operating activities and borrowings on our line of credit or replacement facilities  will be sufficient to meet our working capital  capital expenditure and debt service requirements beyond the next months 
operating cash flows net cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal the change in our operating cash flows was primarily due to 
table of contents changes in working capital defined as current assets less current liabilities 
net changes in assets and liabilities negatively affected our operating cash flows by million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal the net difference of million accounted for most of the increase in our operating cash flows in fiscal versus fiscal in fiscal  net changes in assets and liabilities positively affected our operating cash flows by million 
during fiscal  pharmacy and other receivables increased million from the end of fiscal the increase was primarily due to increased amounts owed to us from vendors as a result of changes in some of our contractual purchase arrangements  the timing of payments from customers in our pbm segment and increased pharmacy receivables arising from higher sales 
during fiscal  receivables increased million from the end of fiscal  primarily due to increased pharmacy receivables arising from higher sales  as well as changes in payment terms for certain of our pbm customers 
the million decrease in receivables during fiscal was primarily due to store closures during the year 
during fiscal  inventories increased million from the end of fiscal  primarily due to higher inventory levels in our distribution centers as a result of our efforts to remain in stock during the grocery strike in southern california and the system conversion in our northern california facility  in addition to increasing the amount of merchandise we carry in our distribution centers 
the million increase in inventory levels during fiscal was primarily the result of lower than anticipated sell through of inventory during the third and fourth quarters of the year 
the million decrease in inventories during fiscal was primarily due to store closures during the year 
during fiscal  current and other liabilities  excluding the current portion of long term debt  increased million from fiscal the increase was primarily due to a million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses resulting from higher inventory levels and improved payment terms with many of our vendors  a million increase in employee compensation and benefits primarily related to increased workers compensation reserves during the year  and a million increase in taxes payable due to increased current taxes due  and the effect of income tax credits in fiscal which had the effect of lowering taxes payable last year 
the decrease in current and other liabilities during fiscal was primarily due to a reduction in accounts payable and accrued expenses of million 
during fiscal  we resolved a payment dispute with a vendor  resulting in payment of amounts early in the fiscal year that were in outstanding payables as of the end of fiscal we also accelerated the timing of our payments to certain vendors during fiscal in addition  taxes payable were lower in fiscal due to tax credits 
the increase in current and other liabilities in fiscal was a result of higher payables due to a payment dispute with a vendor  offset by decreases in reserves as stores were closed during the year 
working capital was million as of january   million as of january  and million as of january  as of january   current liabilities included million for the current maturities of long term debt million on our unsecured revolving line of credit  which expires in october  and million of principal payments due during fiscal on our private placement notes 
excluding debt  our working capital on a per store basis increased to thousand in fiscal from thousand in fiscal  primarily as a result of higher inventories and receivables  partially offset by increased current liabilities 
we plan to reduce our working capital  excluding debt  by approximately million on an equivalent store basis during fiscal changes in equivalent store working capital serve as a measure of our working capital management  excluding the effects of changes in the number of stores 
we calculate the change in equivalent store working capital by multiplying the change in average working capital per store by the number of stores open as of the end of the current period 
we exclude the current maturities of long term debt from our calculation of equivalent store working capital because we intend to renew or replace the line of credit prior to its october expiration date and refinance all or a portion of the current maturities of the private placement notes 

table of contents closed stores will continue to impact future operating cash flows negatively as we make payments associated with our noncancelable lease obligations associated with those stores 
however  those payments will be partially  and in some cases fully  offset by sublease rental income and the elimination of the operating cash flow losses that were incurred by the closed stores prior to closure 
the majority of the payments associated with closed stores will occur over their respective remaining lease terms of up to years  with an average lease term of approximately years 
as a result  we do not expect our existing closed store obligations to affect our operating cash flows significantly in any single fiscal year unless we close a significant number of stores in a short period 
our store closure reserves were million as of january  investing cash flows net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal investing activities primarily consist of capital expenditures for new stores  store remodels and improvements  equipment  technology and supply chain improvements  partially offset by cash receipts from property dispositions and sale leaseback transactions 
fiscal investing cash outflows also included million for the acquisition of the remaining of rxamerica  net of cash acquired 
prior to our acquisition of ownership of rxamerica in september  it was a joint venture between longs and albertson s  inc capital expenditures were million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal the increase from fiscal to fiscal was due primarily to investments in store pharmacy robotics and digital photography technologies 
our capital expenditures also included investments in new stores  store remodels and improvements  equipment  technology and supply chain upgrades 
cash receipts from property dispositions were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal in fiscal  we sold two previously closed store properties as well as one of our support facilities that we closed in the first half of the year 
fiscal receipts included million associated with five sale leaseback transactions 
we may enter into additional sale leaseback transactions in the future to provide funding for a portion of our capital expenditures 
we also may sell additional properties  particularly if we close stores on our company owned properties 
we opened new stores in fiscal  new stores in fiscal and new stores in fiscal we also remodeled stores during fiscal we plan to open approximately to new stores and to remodel up to existing stores in fiscal we expect net capital expenditures in fiscal to be between million and million  primarily for new store investments  remodels and improvements to existing stores  technology and supply chain improvements  including expenditures under the supply chain program discussed further below 
in addition  in the ordinary course of business we may acquire stores  store related assets including pharmacy customer lists  or other complementary businesses 
in february  our board of directors approved a program to upgrade our supply chain systems and processes 
over the term of this program february through expected completion in fiscal  we expect to invest approximately million in capital expenditures for supply chain improvements  largely related to systems changes 
since inception of the program  we have invested approximately million in capital expenditures 
financing cash flows net cash used in financing activities was million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal our financing activities primarily consist of long term borrowings and repayments  repurchases of common stock and dividend payments 
in fiscal  borrowings under our unsecured revolving line of credit were million 
we used these borrowings  together with cash flows from operations  to finance capital expenditures  stock repurchases and 
table of contents dividend payments 
we also repaid million of long term borrowings  consisting of regularly scheduled principal payments on our private placement notes 
in fiscal  we repaid million of long term borrowings  including million under our revolving line of credit and million of regularly scheduled principal payments on our private placement notes 
in fiscal  we obtained million in additional privately placed debt financing  offset by million in repayments of long term and short term borrowings 
in february and march  we repurchased  shares of our common stock at a total cost of million to complete a share repurchase program authorized by our board of directors in november in march  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to  additional shares of our common stock through january  for a maximum total expenditure of million 
we repurchased  shares under the new authorization in march at a total cost of million 
any future repurchase of our common stock will depend on existing market conditions  our financial position  and other capital requirements 
our board of directors makes decisions about the declaration of quarterly dividends based on  among other things  our results of operations and financial position 
we have paid regular quarterly dividends of per share per share annually for each of the last three fiscal years 
total dividends were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of january  payments due by period total less than year years years more than years thousands long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases purchase obligations other long term liabilities total see debt  leases and commitments and contingencies in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for further information about the above items 
purchase obligations primarily represent outstanding commitments to purchase pharmaceutical inventories from amerisourcebergen corporation under a long term supply contract for use in the normal course of business 
purchase obligations also include merchandise purchase commitments under other long term supply contracts  as well as outstanding commitments under purchase orders issued in the normal course of business 
our other long term liabilities of million as of january  consisted of million of deferred rent  million of capital lease obligations  million of deferred tax liabilities and million of store closure reserves 
these items either are not of a contractual nature  such as deferred rent and deferred income taxes  or are included elsewhere in the above table  such as capital and closed store lease obligations 
in addition to the above obligations  we incur substantial cash requirements for the payment of interest and income taxes each year 
payments for interest fluctuate based on our borrowings and interest rates 
our cash payments for interest were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal most of our outstanding debt million as of january  bears interest at fixed rates 
borrowings on our unsecured revolving line of credit million as of january  bear interest at libor based rates 
a substantial portion of our outstanding debt obligations million  including of all the 
table of contents million borrowed under our unsecured revolving line of credit  matures in fiscal we intend to renew or replace the line of credit prior to its expiration 
the amount of borrowings and interest rates on the replacement facility will affect the amount of interest we incur in the future 
our cash payments for income taxes were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal payments for income taxes fluctuate based on our taxable income and the availability of tax deductions and credits 
we also incur obligations for contributions to our employee savings and profit sharing plan 
we match a portion of our employees voluntary contributions and provide profit sharing contributions to the plan in some years 
our contributions to the plan  which may be made in cash or in shares of our common stock  fluctuate based on the level of participation in the plan by our employees as well as our levels of income 
we contributed million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal to this plan  all of which we funded with shares of our common stock 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not make use of any off balance sheet arrangements that currently have or that we expect are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
we utilize operating leases for many of our store locations  and from time to time we engage in sale leaseback arrangements for financing purposes 
we do not use special purpose entities in any of our leasing arrangements 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
uncertainties regarding such estimates and assumptions are inherent in the preparation of our financial statements  and actual results may differ from those estimates and assumptions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies require the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements accounts receivable and reserves our receivables primarily include amounts due from third party providers eg  pharmacy benefit managers  insurance companies and governmental agencies  vendors and our pharmacy benefit management customers 
we maintain an allowance for the amount of these receivables that we estimate to be uncollectible 
our estimates of uncollectible amounts are based on our historical collection experience  current economic and credit conditions and any information available to us indicating that specific accounts are unlikely to be collected 
we have historically collected a relatively high percentage of our accounts receivable  especially pharmacy receivables  and our credit and collection losses have not materially adversely affected us 
however  if the financial condition of our third party providers  vendors or pbm customers deteriorates  we may increase the allowance for uncollectible accounts and our recovery of recorded receivables may be significantly affected 
merchandise inventories we record our inventories at the lower of cost or market value 
if we do not sell the merchandise at expected prices or if we make decisions to significantly reduce or eliminate merchandise items or categories  we may increase the allowance for markdowns and our realization of recorded inventories may be significantly affected 

table of contents we use the last in  first out lifo method to determine inventory cost 
the calculation of lifo inventory costs depends on a number of factors  including inflation rates  inventory levels and merchandise mix  that require estimates during interim periods 
these estimates are subject to substantial variability and may result in significant adjustments  particularly during the fourth quarter  when final inflation rates and inventory levels and mix are determined 
impairment of long lived assets we review long lived tangible assets and intangible assets with finite useful lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable 
using our best estimates based on reasonable assumptions and projections  we record an impairment loss to write the assets down to their estimated fair values if the carrying values of such assets exceed their related undiscounted expected future cash flows 
we review goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances warrant 
we perform our annual impairment testing during the fourth fiscal quarter  when updated financial projections are available 
if the carrying values of such assets exceed their estimated fair values  we record an impairment loss to write the assets down to their estimated fair values 
we generally evaluate store specific long lived tangible assets and intangible assets with finite useful lives at an individual store level  which is the lowest level at which independent cash flows can be identified 
we evaluate corporate assets or other long lived assets that are not store specific at a consolidated entity or segment level as appropriate 
we evaluate goodwill at a reporting unit level in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
geographic regional divisions within the retail drug store segment comprise our reporting units 
since quoted market prices are not typically available for our long lived tangible and intangible assets  we estimate fair values for most assets based on the expected present value of future cash flows 
we estimate future cash flows based on store level historical results  current trends and operating and cash flow projections 
our estimates are subject to substantial uncertainty and may be affected by a number of factors outside of our control  including general economic conditions  the competitive environment and regulatory changes 
if actual results differ from our estimates  we may record significant additional impairment charges in the future 
we recorded impairment charges of million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal in fiscal  we recorded million of system technology assets we abandoned and million of accelerated depreciation on a pharmacy system platform that we no longer use 
in fiscal  we recorded million related to the impairment of system technology assets that we abandoned 
we have made substantial investments in technology assets  should their utility not manifest as expected we could incur substantial impairment charges or accelerated depreciation 
store closure reserves prior to january   we recorded the estimated costs associated with closing a store during the period in which the store was identified and approved by management under a plan of termination  which included the method of disposition and the expected date of completion 
these costs include direct costs to terminate a lease  lease rental payments net of expected sublease income  and the difference between the carrying values and estimated recoverable values of long lived tangible and intangible assets 
we recorded severance and other employee related costs in the period in which we communicated the closure and related severance packages to the affected employees 
effective with the adoption of sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  on january   we recognize a liability for costs associated with closing a store when the liability 
table of contents is incurred 
we record the present value of expected future lease costs  net of estimated sublease future income  when the store is closed 
we record severance and other employee related costs in the period in which we communicate the closure and related severance packages to the affected employees 
our calculation of store closure costs includes significant estimates about the amounts and timing of future sublease income 
these estimates are based on our historical experience  the condition and location of the property  the lease terms and current real estate leasing market conditions 
if actual results differ from our estimates  we may significantly adjust our store closure reserves in future periods 
we recorded provisions for store closures of million in fiscal and million in fiscal  and a benefit of million in fiscal in addition  periodically we make judgments about which stores we should close and which stores we should continue to operate 
during fiscal  we took a series of actions to improve the operating performance of underperforming stores and of stores opened during the last three years 
we closed one of these stores during the year  and have presently decided to continue operating the remainder  while continuing to closely monitor their operating performance 
if we decide to close a number of these stores  we could incur substantial additional store closure costs 
insurance reserves we maintain insurance coverage for significant exposures as well as those risks required to be insured by law 
it is generally our policy to retain a significant portion of certain losses related to workers compensation  general liability  property losses  pharmacist liability  business interruptions and employee health care 
we record provisions for these items based on claims experience  regulatory changes  an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported and other relevant factors 
we discount reserves for workers compensation and general liability claims to their expected present value using an essentially risk free interest rate 
the projections involved in this estimate are subject to substantial uncertainty because of several unpredictable factors  including actual claims experience  regulatory changes  litigation trends and changes in inflation and interest rates 
our workers compensation and other insurance related expenses increased million  or of sales  in fiscal our self insurance exposure is concentrated in california  where the majority of our stores are located 
california has experienced significant increases in workers compensation costs as a result of legislative changes and rising medical costs 
the california state legislature is currently considering changes to the state s workers compensation laws in an effort to reduce costs  and we cannot predict the outcome of such deliberations 
increases in workers compensation costs have adversely affected our results of operations and may continue to adversely affect us in the future 
if claims are greater than we estimated  or if costs increase beyond what we anticipated  our recorded reserves may not be sufficient  and we may need to record significant additional expense 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from the sale of merchandise and services  net of an allowance for estimated returns  at the time the merchandise is sold or services performed 
the allowance for sales returns is estimated based on our historical experience 
historically  our sales returns have not been significant  but changes in our experience could result in significant additional reserves 
we recognize revenue from our pbm segment when our rxamerica subsidiary has completed its service obligations under its contracts  including the approval or denial of the authorization request to the participating pharmacy 
rxamerica does not take title to prescription drug inventories or assume substantial risks and rewards of inventory ownership or receivable collection 
accordingly  under our existing contracts we recognize pbm revenues from third party health plans net of the reimbursements due to participating pharmacies 
we do not 
table of contents recognize or otherwise reflect in our financial statements co payments made to participating pharmacies by health plan members 
we estimate certain rebate revenues in our pbm segment based on our historical experience  contractual terms and prescription drug utilization mix 
these estimates are subject to uncertainty and actual results could differ significantly 
vendor rebates and allowances we record merchandise rebates and allowances as a reduction of cost of sales when we sell the related inventory 
we recognize advertising rebates and allowances as a reduction of advertising expense  a component of cost of sales  when we incur the related advertising expense or complete the required performance 
we defer lump sum payments received from vendors in connection with a contractual arrangement and recognize them over the contract term as a reduction of cost of sales 
some of our contractual arrangements require estimates of the rebate amounts earned and collectible 
if actual rebates and allowances received differ from our estimates  we may be required to record significant adjustments to our rebates and allowances 
other significant accounting policies the above policies are not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  generally accepted accounting principles specifically dictate the accounting treatment for a particular transaction 
there are also certain areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
see the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for a more complete discussion of our accounting policies and other disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles 
new accounting pronouncements see note  the company and significant accounting policies  in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 

table of contents risk factors you should carefully read the following risk factors 
our ability to successfully implement significant organizational changes  including new supply chain systems and processes  is critical to the ongoing success of our business 
we are currently undertaking significant organizational changes  including store workflow and staffing changes  increased centralization  restructured incentive compensation arrangements and other strategic initiatives 
in addition  in february our board of directors approved a program to upgrade our supply chain  primarily through technology systems changes  in an effort to increase efficiency and enhance profitability 
such organizational and technology systems changes are complex and could cause disruptions that would adversely affect our sales  gross profit and operating and administrative expenses 
for example  the implementation of new distribution management software in one of our front end distribution centers caused some disruption in our supply chain  which adversely affected our front end sales and gross profit during the second half of fiscal our ability to successfully implement these organizational  systems and process changes  which are significant to our operations and business  is critical to our future profitability 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to execute these changes successfully and without significant disruption to our business 
if we are not successful  we may not achieve any of the expected benefits from these initiatives  despite having expended significant capital and human effort 
furthermore  we may encounter difficulties implementing this amount of change in our organization that could have a negative impact on our implementation plans and project budgets 
we may also determine that additional investment is required to bring our supply chain and related systems to their desired state  this could result in significant additional investment of time and money and implementation risk 
continued economic softness could continue to adversely affect consumer buying practices and reduce our sales and profitability 
a sluggish economy has adversely affected our sales and operating profitability for the past two fiscal years 
the economy is very soft in many of the markets we serve  particularly california  where unemployment is high and a state budget crisis has created a climate of political uncertainty 
if the economy remains soft or slows further  or if unemployment increases  our pharmacy sales could be adversely affected as consumers may lose their health insurance due to unemployment 
further  if economic conditions  war  terrorism or other global concerns continue to worry consumers  they may continue to decrease their purchases  particularly of products other than pharmaceutical products 
we make a higher profit on our sales of front end products than we do on sales of pharmaceutical products 
therefore  any continued decrease in our sales of front end products would decrease our profitability 
the retail drug store and pharmacy benefit management industries are highly competitive  and further increases in competition could adversely affect us 
we face intense competition with local  regional and national companies  including other drug store chains  independent drug stores  mail order pharmacies  on line retailers  supermarket chains and mass merchandisers 
in the pbm industry  our competitors include large national and regional pbms  some of which are owned by our retail drug store competitors 
many of our competitors have substantially greater resources  including name recognition and capital resources  than we do 
as competition increases in the markets in which we operate  a significant increase in general pricing pressures could occur  which could require us to reduce prices  purchase more effectively and increase customer service to remain competitive 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to compete effectively in our markets or increase our sales volume or margins in response to further increased competition 
changes in third party reimbursement levels for prescription drugs continue to reduce our margins on pharmacy sales and could have a material adverse effect on our overall performance 
we are wholly or partially reimbursed by third party health plans for approximately of all the prescription drugs that we sell 
pharmacy sales reimbursed by third parties  including medicare and medicaid 
table of contents plans  have lower gross margins than non third party pharmacy sales 
third party health plans continue to reduce the levels at which they reimburse us for the prescription drugs that we provide to their members 
furthermore  the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of included new prescription drug benefits for medicare participants 
also  the proposed california state budget includes a proposed across the board reduction in medi cal reimbursements to pharmacies effective july  if the state of california implements these or similar reductions in reimbursement levels  our sales and gross profits could be significantly adversely affected 
if third party health plans continue to reduce their reimbursement levels  or if medicare covers prescription drugs at reimbursement levels lower than our current retail prices  our margins on these sales will continue to be reduced  and our profitability will be adversely affected 
the significant investments we are making in our stores may not increase our sales and profitability  which could adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
we are currently making significant investments in our stores in an effort to increase our sales and profitability 
these investments include the installation of new digital photo equipment  technology  and remodels and other improvements to some existing stores 
these investments require significant capital expenditures and human effort and are largely unprecedented at our company 
we are uncertain about consumer reaction to these changes and therefore we cannot assure you that they will result in increased sales and profitability 
a failure to increase our sales and profitability would adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
continued volatility in insurance related expenses and the markets for insurance coverage could have a material adverse affect on us 
the costs of most types of insurance  especially workers compensation  employee benefits  director and officer and others have continued to rise  while the amount and availability of coverage have decreased 
claims costs for workers compensation and other self insured exposures have also increased 
in fiscal  for example  our insurance related expenses increased million  or of sales  over fiscal these conditions have been exacerbated by rising health care costs  legislative changes  economic conditions and terrorism 
if our insurance related costs continue to increase significantly  or if we are unable to obtain adequate levels of insurance  our financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected 
we are substantially dependent on a single supplier of pharmaceutical products to sell products to us on satisfactory terms 
a disruption in our relationship with this supplier could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we obtain approximately half of our total merchandise  including over of our pharmaceuticals  from a single supplier  amerisourcebergen  with whom we have a long term supply contract 
any significant disruptions in our relationship with amerisourcebergen  or deterioration in amerisourcebergen s financial condition  could have a material adverse effect on us 
recent news reports indicate that federal regulatory and law enforcement agencies are investigating certain of amerisourcebergen s business practices 
if these or other investigations result in significant sanctions or penalties against amerisourcebergen  or in significant changes to their business practices  they could have an adverse impact on our relationship with amerisourcebergen and thereby adversely affect our business 
our ability to attract and retain pharmacy personnel or develop alternate fill sources is important to the continued success of our business 
our industry is continuing to experience a shortage of licensed pharmacists in the markets in which we operate 
our inability to attract and retain pharmacists and other key personnel could adversely affect us 
in order to mitigate this risk we entered into a joint venture agreement with amerisourcebergen to operate a central prescription fill center 
the success of this fill center  which cannot be assured  is important to our ability to 
table of contents address the shortage of pharmacists  but additional efforts may be necessary to address this business issue 
other options may be costly or unavailable to us 
further  a significant disruption in our fill center s operations could worsen the effects of the pharmacist shortage and adversely affect our business 
we are subject to governmental regulations  procedures and requirements 
our noncompliance with  or a significant change in  these regulations could have a material adverse effect on us 
our pharmacy and pbm businesses are subject to numerous federal  state and local regulations  many of which are new and developing 
these include  but are not limited to  local registrations of pharmacies in the states where our pharmacies are located and applicable medicare and medicaid regulations 
in addition  the health insurance portability and accountability act  or hipaa imposes certain requirements regarding the protection of confidential patient medical records and other information 
compliance with these regulations  particularly hipaa  requires that we implement complex changes to our systems and processes 
failure to adhere to these and other applicable regulations could result in the imposition of civil and criminal penalties 
furthermore  any new federal or state regulations or reforms  including healthcare reform initiatives or pharmacy benefit management regulation  could adversely affect us 
certain risks are inherent in providing pharmacy services  and our insurance may not be adequate to cover some claims against us 
pharmacies are exposed to risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other healthcare products and are significantly dependent upon suppliers to provide safe  government approved and non counterfeit products 
although we maintain professional liability and errors and omissions liability insurance  should a product liability issue arise  we cannot assure you that the coverage limits under our insurance programs will be adequate to protect us against future claims  that we will be able to maintain this insurance on acceptable terms in the future or that the damage to our reputation in the event of a product liability issue will not have a material adverse effect on our business 
our geographic concentration in the western united states presents certain risks that could adversely affect us 
our stores  distribution centers and corporate offices are located in the western united states 
risks prevalent in this region include  but are not limited to  major earthquakes  periodic energy shortages and rising energy costs  and shipping and other transportation related disruptions 
because of our geographic concentration  these risks could result in significant disruptions to our business or increased operating expenses 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures of market risk our major market risk exposure is changing interest rates 
we use debt financing in combination with operating cash flows to support capital expenditures  acquisitions  working capital needs  dividend payments  share repurchases and other general corporate purposes 
a portion of our debt million at january  bears interest at libor based rates  and therefore an increase in interest rates could increase our interest expense 
we do not currently undertake any specific actions to cover our exposure to interest rate risk and we are not currently a party to any interest rate risk management transactions 
we have not purchased and do not currently hold any derivative financial instruments 
depending on the interest rate environment and subject to approval by our board of directors  we may make use of derivative financial instruments or other interest rate management vehicles in the future 
a change in interest rates basis points on our floating rate debt as of january  would have an immaterial effect on our earnings and cash flows and on the fair value of our fixed rate debt
