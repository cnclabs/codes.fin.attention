item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes which appear elsewhere in this form k 
it contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
please see note on forward looking statements for more information 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those discussed below and elsewhere in this form k 
overview we are an international insurance holding company focusing on specialty products for niches within the overall property casualty insurance market 
our largest product line and most long standing area of specialization is ocean marine insurance 
we have also developed specialty niches in professional liability insurance and in specialty liability insurance which primarily consists of contractors liability coverages 
we conduct operations through our insurance company subsidiaries  the navigators agencies and our lloyd s operations 
while management takes into consideration a wide range of factors in planning the company s business strategy and evaluating results of operations  there are certain factors that management believes are fundamental to understanding how the company is managed 
first  underwriting profit is consistently emphasized as a primary goal  above premium growth 
management s assessment of our trends and potential growth in underwriting profit is the dominant factor in its decisions with respect to whether or not to expand a business line  enter into a new niche  product or territory or  conversely  to contract capacity in any business line 
in addition  management focuses on managing the costs of our operations 
management believes that careful monitoring of the costs of existing operations and assessment of costs of potential growth opportunities are important to our profitability 
access to capital also has a significant impact on management s outlook for our operations 
our insurance company subsidiaries operations and ability to grow their business and take advantage of market opportunities are particularly constrained by regulatory capital requirements and rating agency assessments of capital adequacy 
for example  we contributed million of the approximately million in net proceeds we received from the october equity offering to the statutory surplus of navigators insurance company in order to position the company to be able to capitalize on domestic and international insurance business opportunities that management believes will be profitable 
although not a financial measure  management s decisions are also greatly influenced by access to specialized underwriting and claims expertise in our lines of business 
we have chosen to operate in specialty niches with certain common characteristics which we believe provide us with the opportunity to use our technical underwriting expertise in order to realize underwriting profit 
as a result  we have focused on underserved markets for businesses characterized by higher severity and low frequency of loss where we believe our intellectual capital and financial strength bring meaningful value 
in contrast  we have avoided niches that we believe have a high frequency of loss activity and or are subject to a high level of regulatory coverage requirements  such as workers compensation and personal automobile insurance  because we do not believe our technical expertise is of as much value in these types of businesses 
examples of niches that have the characteristics we look for include bluewater hull which provides coverage for physical damage to  for example  highly valued cruise ships and directors and officers liability which covers litigation exposure of a corporation s directors and officers 
these types of exposures require substantial technical expertise 
we attempt to mitigate the financial impact of severe claims on our results by conservative and detailed underwriting  prudent use of reinsurance and a balanced portfolio of risks 
a n n u a l r e p o r t our revenue is primarily comprised of premiums  commission and investment income 
our insurance company subsidiaries derive their premiums primarily from business written by the navigators agencies 
the lloyd s operations derive their premiums from business written by nual 
the navigators agencies and nual receive commissions and  in some cases  profit commissions and service fees on the business produced on behalf of our insurance company subsidiaries and others 
over the past two years  we have experienced beneficial market changes in our lines of businesses 
as a result of several large losses in the second quarter of  the marine insurance market began to experience diminished capacity and rate increases  initially in the offshore energy line of business 
as conditions in the overall property casualty insurance market have hardened since the third quarter of  certain property casualty insurers who also compete in our marine and specialty liability lines of business have reduced their capacity generally and in the marine and specialty liability lines specifically 
specialty liability losses have also resulted in diminished capacity in the market in which we compete  as many former competitors who lacked the expertise to selectively underwrite this business have been forced to withdraw from the market 
in the professional liability market  the enactment of the sarbanes oxley act of  together with recent financial and accounting scandals at publicly traded corporations and increased frequency of securities related class action litigation  has lead to an invigorated interest in professional liability insurance generally 
these conditions have resulted in rate increases as well as an overall improvement in policy terms and conditions for our professional liability line of business 
while we believe that the hardening of the markets in which we operate will continue for the foreseeable future  albeit at a less dramatic rate compared to the past twenty four months  our business is cyclical and influenced by many factors that could cause our positive outlook to change 
these factors include price competition  economic conditions  interest rates  natural or man made disasters for example hurricanes and terrorism  state regulations  court decisions and changes in the law 
additionally  because our insurance products must be priced  and premiums charged  before costs have fully developed  our liabilities are required to be estimated and recorded in recognition of future loss and settlement obligations 
due to the inherent uncertainty in estimating these liabilities  we cannot assure you that our actual liabilities will not exceed our recorded amounts 
for additional information regarding our business  see business general 
critical accounting policies it is important to understand our accounting policies in order to understand our financial statements 
management considers certain of these policies to be critical to the presentation of the financial results  since they require management to make estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  and related disclosures at the financial reporting date and throughout the period being reported upon 
certain of the estimates result from judgments that can be subjective and complex  and consequently actual results may differ from these estimates  which would be reflected in future periods 
our most critical accounting policies involve the reporting of the reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses including losses that have occurred but were not reported to us by the financial reporting date  reinsurance recoverables  written and unearned premium  the recoverability of deferred tax assets  the impairment of invested assets  accounting for lloyd s results  goodwill and the translation of foreign currencies 
loss reserves and loss adjustment expenses 
loss reserves represent an estimate of the expected cost of the ultimate settlement and administration of losses  based on facts and circumstances then known 
actuarial methodologies are employed to assist in establishing such estimates and include judgments relative to estimates of future claims severity and frequency  length of time to develop to ultimate  judicial theories of liability and other third party factors which are often beyond our control 
due to the inherent uncertainty associated with the reserving process  the ultimate liability may be different from the a n n u a l r e p o r t original estimate 
such estimates are regularly reviewed and updated and any resulting adjustments are included in the current year s results 
additional information regarding our loss reserves can be found in results of operations operating expenses net losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred  business reserves  and note to our consolidated audited financial statements  all of which are included herein 
reinsurance recoverables 
reinsurance recoverables are established for the portion of the loss reserves that are ceded to reinsurers 
reinsurance recoverables are determined based upon the terms and conditions of reinsurance contracts which could be subject to interpretations that differ from our own based on judicial theories of liability 
in addition  we bear credit risk with respect to our reinsurers which can be significant considering that certain of the reserves remain outstanding for an extended period of time 
we are required to pay losses even if a reinsurer fails to meet its obligations under the applicable reinsurance agreement 
see the business reinsurance ceded section and note to our consolidated audited financial statements  both included herein 
written and unearned premium 
written premium is recorded based on the insurance policies that have been reported to us and the policies that have been written by agents but not yet reported to us 
we must estimate the amount of written premium not yet reported based on judgments relative to current and historical trends of the business being written 
such estimates are regularly reviewed and updated and any resulting adjustments are included in the current year s results 
an unearned premium reserve is established to reflect the unexpired portion of each policy at the financial reporting date 
see note to our consolidated audited financial statements  included herein 
deferred tax assets 
we have recorded valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets resulting from certain net operating loss carryforwards due to the uncertainty associated with the realization of the deferred tax asset related to certain of our foreign  state and local operations 
our foreign operations were profitable in and resulting in a portion of the valuation allowance being simultaneously released to the extent of the profits and the first nine months of profits in due to the continued profitability and projected favorable market conditions for the foreseeable future  it was determined to be more likely than not that the deferred tax assets resulting from those net operating loss carryforwards will be realized  therefore the remaining valuation allowance related to the foreign operations was released in the fourth quarter of see note to our consolidated audited financial statements  included herein 
impairment of invested assets 
impairment of investment securities results in a charge to operations when a market decline below cost is other than temporary 
management regularly reviews our fixed maturity and equity securities portfolios to evaluate the necessity of recording impairment losses for other than temporary declines in the fair value of investments 
a number of criteria are considered during this process including  but not limited to the current fair value as compared to cost or amortized cost  as appropriate  of the security  the length of time the security s fair value has been below cost or amortized cost  and by how much  and specific credit issues related to the issuer and current economic conditions 
in general  we focus our attention on those securities whose market value was less than of their cost or amortized cost  as appropriate  for six or more consecutive months 
other factors considered in evaluating potential impairment include the current fair value as compared to cost or amortized cost  as appropriate  our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in value  specific credit issues related to the issuer and current economic conditions 
other than temporary impairment losses result in a permanent reduction of the cost basis of the underlying investment 
significant changes in the factors we consider when evaluating investments for impairment losses could result in a significant change in impairment losses reported in the consolidated financial statements 
for additional detail regarding our investment a n n u a l r e p o r t portfolio at december  and  including disclosures regarding other than temporary declines in investment value  see the business investments section and note to our consolidated audited financial statements  both included herein 
accounting for lloyd s results 
we record our pro rata share of lloyd s syndicate assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  after making adjustments to convert lloyd s accounting to us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
the most significant us gaap adjustments relate to income recognition 
lloyd s syndicates determine underwriting results by year of account at the end of three years 
we record adjustments to recognize underwriting results as incurred  including the expected ultimate cost of losses incurred 
these adjustments to losses are based on actuarial analysis of syndicate accounts  including forecasts of expected ultimate losses provided by the syndicate 
at the end of the lloyd s three year period for determining underwriting results for an account year  the syndicate will close the account year by reinsuring outstanding claims on that account year with the participants for the account s next underwriting year 
the amount to close an underwriting year into the next year is referred to as the reinsurance to close 
the reinsurance to close transactions are recorded as additional written and earned premium  losses incurred  loss reserves and receivables  all in the same amount 
there are no gains or losses recorded on the reinsurance to close transactions 
see note to our consolidated audited financial statements  included herein 
goodwill 
the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  effective january  sfas changes the accounting for goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives from an amortization approach to an impairment only approach that requires that those assets be tested at least annually for impairment 
we completed our annual impairment review of goodwill resulting in no impairment as of january  if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  an impairment loss will be recognized 
see note to our consolidated audited financial statements  included herein 
translation of foreign currencies 
financial statements of subsidiaries expressed in foreign currencies are translated into us dollars in accordance with sfas no 
foreign currency translation issued by the fasb 
under sfas  functional currency assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars using period end rates of exchange and the related translation adjustments are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
functional currencies are generally the currencies of the local operating environment 
statement of income amounts expressed in functional currencies are translated using average exchange rates 
gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are recorded in other income expense in the company s consolidated statements of income 
results of operations and overview the following is a discussion and analysis of our consolidated and segment results of operations for the years ended december   and our  and results of operations reflect increasing premium rates as a result of improved market conditions beginning in late and continuing through net income for  and was million or per share  million or per share and million or per share  respectively 
we experienced rapid premium growth as measured by net earned premium in and of and  respectively  due to the combination of increased premium rates and business expansion 
underwriting profitability during such periods  as measured by the company s combined ratios  has also improved for the and business written which has been adversely impacted by reserve strengthening in cash flow from operations has also increased in and by approximately and  respectively  contributing to the growth in invested assets and net investment income 
the growth in investment income has been mitigated a n n u a l r e p o r t in and actually declined in as a result of the overall declines in interest rates on the portfolios caused principally by overall declines in interest rates 
investment performance in and was also adversely impacted by investment losses described below 
results the results of operations were adversely impacted by an after tax charge of million or per diluted share for incurred losses related to asbestos exposures 
the company s combined ratio of was negatively impacted by percentage points for incurred losses related to asbestos and environmental exposures 
navigators insurance company increased its gross and net asbestos reserves for losses by million and million  respectively  in the fourth quarter of as a result  gross and net incurred losses increased by the amount of the respective reserve increase 
the reserve action was the result of a review of asbestos related exposures conducted by the company 
the company s management was notified in late january that an asbestos claim would likely have to be settled for a significantly greater amount than previously anticipated 
as a result of the unexpected adverse development on this individual claim  the company retained a leading independent consulting firm in this area to assist in the identification of its potential exposure to asbestos claims from policies written directly as well as those reinsured to navigators insurance company from prior members of the company s insurance pools 
the company s increased reserves relate primarily to policies underwritten by navigators agencies in the late s and first half of the s on behalf of members of the pool  consisting of excess liability on marine related business and aviation products liability  including policies subsequently assumed by navigators insurance company pursuant to reinsurance arrangements with pool members who exited the pool 
following the company s and the independent consulting firm s recent review  the company determined to increase its gross and net loss reserves for asbestos exposure to million and million  respectively  at december  during  the company enhanced its financial position and ability to take advantage of market opportunities as a result of its october equity offering by paying off its remaining outstanding debt  contributing million to the statutory surplus of navigators insurance company and increasing its stamp capacity at lloyd s by increasing its letter of credit facility 
results the results of operations reflect a substantial improvement in underwriting profitability as evidenced by the company s combined ratio of compared to for the results of operations were adversely impacted by an after tax charge of million or per diluted share for impairment losses on asset backed securities 
results the results of operations were adversely impacted by approximately million  pre tax and after tax  resulting from the world trade center attack  consisting of estimated net incurred losses of million and the net effect of reinsurance reinstatement premiums of million  all of which originated from our lloyd s operations 
this represents our best estimate of our maximum exposure determined by an analysis of policies that may have incurred a loss resulting from the terrorist attack 
no additional losses related to the world trade center attack were incurred during or however  given the uncertainty surrounding this event  the estimate may change over time as additional information becomes available 
the results of operations also include the adverse impact of an after tax charge of million or per diluted share for an investment in a corporate capital vehicle which provided underwriting capacity to lloyd s syndicates and million or per diluted share for impairment losses for asset backed securities investments 
a n n u a l r e p o r t revenues 
gross written premium increased to million in from million in and million in the following table sets forth our gross and net written premium and net earned premium by segment and line of business for the periods indicated year ended december  gross written premium net written premium net earned premium gross written premium net written premium net earned premium gross written premium net written premium net earned premium in thousands insurance companies marine     specialty     professional liability     assumed from lloyds operations    other   insurance companies total    lloyd s operations marine     other      lloyd s operations total    intercompany eliminations   total     note certain amounts for prior years have been reclassified to conform to the current year s presentation 
insurance companies gross written premium marine premium 
the and marine premium increased and  respectively  due to the increase in premium rates resulting in higher premiums on new and renewal business 
the generally improved pricing environment resulted in navigators insurance company increasing its writing of new business which was partially offset in by a reduction of business in certain specific areas due to pricing concerns 
the increased premium in of million  which is net of business that was not renewed  includes approximately million of premium resulting from rate increases which averaged 
the increased premium in of million resulted from million of new business and million from rate increases which averaged 
navigators insurance company obtains its marine business through participation in the marine pool managed by the navigators agencies 
its participation in the marine pool was in and in and specialty premium 
the specialty premium increased from to and from to due to increased rates and underwriting new policies 
the increased premium in of million  which is net of business that was not renewed  includes approximately million of premium resulting from rate increases which averaged 
during  the number of california construction liability in force policies decreased significantly as a result of our efforts to scale back the number of small artisan policies we write 
the increased premium in of million resulted from million of new business and million of rate increases which averaged 
the new business and the rate increases resulted from a tightening market for california contractors liability insurance 
a n n u a l r e p o r t professional liability insurance 
in late  our insurance company subsidiaries began to write professional liability insurance  primarily consisting of directors and officers liability insurance for privately held and publicly traded corporations 
in  the professional liability business was expanded to include errors and omissions insurance and employment practices liability coverages 
the professional liability premium increased to million in from million in reflecting growth and the expansion of this business 
assumed from lloyd s operations 
since  the insurance companies have participated in quota share treaties on marine and energy business written by the company s lloyd s operations 
lloyd s operations gross written premium marine premium 
marine premium increased in and in partially due to the increase in premium rates resulting in higher premiums on renewal and new business and due to the increased capacity provided to syndicate by navigators corporate underwriters ltd 
and millennium underwriting ltd 
increasing from in to in to in the higher premium rates  averaging approximately in and in  made the business more attractive resulting in the lloyd s operations increasing its writings of new business 
other 
other consists of engineering and construction premium which provides coverage for construction projects including machinery  equipment and loss of use due to delays and of onshore energy premium which principally focuses on the oil and gas  chemical and petrochemical industries with coverages primarily for property damage and business interruption 
ceded written premium 
in the ordinary course of business  we reinsure certain insurance risks with unaffiliated insurance companies for the purpose of limiting our maximum loss exposure  protecting against catastrophic losses  and maintaining desired ratios of net premiums written to statutory surplus 
the relationship of ceded to written premium varies based upon the types of business written and whether the business is written by our insurance company subsidiaries or the lloyd s operations 
there are several factors contributing to an increase in ceded premium when comparing to first  rate increases on our business resulted in higher premium levels  and consequently more ceded premiums 
the second factor is the cost of excess of loss reinsurance purchased to limit our exposure to an individual large loss 
this increased reinsurance costs in the marine and specialty liability business 
effective from april  to september   the reinsurance treaty for our specialty liability business was amended to incorporate a ceding commission from the reinsurer and a rate increase 
third  we increased the amount of quota share reinsurance for certain product lines based upon management s assessment of expected loss activity 
fourth  navigators pro experienced substantial premium growth  resulting in increased amounts of premium ceded to its quota share reinsurance program 
additionally  we entered into quota share reinsurance agreements to reinsure of our syndicate capacity to third parties who provide letters of credit used as collateral at lloyd s 
the amount of ceded premium in increased over due to the increase in gross written premium and the increase in reinsurance rates in the percentage of the lloyd s operations ceded premium increased from in to in due to additional quota share reinsurance 
the percentage of our insurance company subsidiaries premium which was ceded decreased from in to in primarily due to the increase in the specialty insurance premium  of which our insurance company subsidiaries retain more of the premium than in the other lines of business 
net written premium 
net written premium increased from to as a result of the increase in the gross written premium and the increase in the marine pool participation from in to in  partially offset by the increased ceded premium  as discussed above 
net written premium increased from to due to the increase in a n n u a l r e p o r t the gross written premium partially offset by the increase in the percentage of ceded premium from in to in net earned premium 
net earned premium increased in compared to and increased in compared to as a result of rate increases and new business generated in and  and for  the increase in the participation in the marine pool from in to in commission income 
commission income from unaffiliated business decreased by in compared to as a result of a decrease from to of unaffiliated insurers participating in the marine pool managed by navigators agencies 
this decrease occurred effective january  as a result of navigators insurance company increasing its participation in the marine pool from in to in the increase of in compared to resulted from increased premiums written on behalf of unaffiliated insurers in the marine pool 
net investment income 
net investment income increased in due to the increase in invested assets resulting from positive cash flow stemming from the increased premium volume and the proceeds from our october common stock offering 
our net proceeds from the offering amounted to million 
net investment income decreased in from the previous year due to lower interest rates during partially offset by increased invested assets 
see the business investments section included herein for additional information regarding our net investment income 
net realized capital gains 
pre tax net income included  of net realized capital gains for compared to  for and  for on an after tax basis  the net realized capital gains were per share  per share and per share for  and  respectively 
the and net realized capital gains include  and  respectively  of impairment losses recorded on three of our asset backed securities 
other income expense 
other income expense for and consisted primarily of foreign exchange gains and inspection fees related to the specialty insurance business 
other income expense for consisted primarily of a  charge related to our former investment in riverside corporate underwriters  ltd  a lloyd s corporate name 
lloyd s informed us in that it was liable for part of the adverse development in the lloyd s syndicates in which riverside corporate underwriters  ltd 
provided capacity in and we had provided a letter of credit to riverside corporate underwriters  ltd 
in order for riverside corporate underwriters  ltd 
to participate on various lloyd s syndicates 
we believe that we have no further exposure to riverside corporate underwriters  ltd 
operating expenses 
net losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred 
the ratio of net loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred to net earned premium was  and in  and  respectively 
the increase in the loss ratio in compared to was primarily due to the asbestos losses recorded in the fourth quarter of accounting for percentage points of the loss ratio and  to a lesser extent  the adverse development in the california contractors liability portion of the specialty business 
the decrease in the loss ratio in compared to was primarily due to the losses resulting from approximately million of net losses related to the world trade center attack  accounting for percentage points of the loss ratio  and from approximately million of net losses resulting from one large offshore energy claim petrobras in the first quarter of  accounting for percentage points of the loss ratio 
gross losses resulting from the terrorist attack were million with the ceded portion of the losses reinsured by highly rated reinsurers 
we do not discount any of our loss reserves 
the improvements in the premium rates have benefited the loss ratio 
a n n u a l r e p o r t the following tables set forth our net loss reserves by segment and line of insurance business and the total case reserves and ibnr as of the date indicated as of december  in thousands insurance companies marine    specialty primarily general liability    professional liability   assumed from lloyd s operations   other primarily run off business    total insurance companies    lloyd s operations marine    other   total lloyd s operations    total net loss reserves    total net case loss reserves    total net ibnr loss reserves    total net loss reserves    at december   the ibnr loss reserve was  or of our total loss reserves compared to in and in at december   a change in the net loss reserves would equate to million which would represent an after tax charge to net income of million and of stockholders equity 
loss reserve estimates are reviewed each quarter to evaluate whether the assumptions made continue to be appropriate 
any adjustments that result from this review are recorded in the quarter in which they are identified 
our reserving practices and the establishment of any particular reserve reflect management s judgment concerning sound financial practice and do not represent any admission of liability with respect to any claims made against us 
no assurance can be given that actual claims made and related payments will not be in excess of the amounts reserved 
during the loss settlement period  it often becomes necessary to refine and adjust the estimates of liability on a claim either upward or downward 
even after such adjustments  ultimate liability may exceed or be less than the revised estimates 
the increase in net loss reserves in all active lines of business is generally a reflection of the growth in premium volume over the last two years 
the net loss reserve increase for also includes an increase in reserves to million from million for asbestos and environmental exposures in the marine and run off business as well as prior year loss reserve strengthening of approximately million in our specialty business related to the california contractors liability business 
approximately million of the increase in asbestos and environmental reserves is recorded in marine and million in other  primarily related to run off aviation business 
a n n u a l r e p o r t as discussed under the caption business reserves  there are a number of factors that could cause actual losses and loss adjustment expenses to differ materially from the amount that we have reserved for losses and loss adjustment expenses 
commission expense 
commission expense paid to brokers and agents is generally on a percentage of the gross written premium and is reduced by ceding commissions the company may receive on the ceded written premium 
commissions are generally deferred and recorded to deferred policy acquisition costs to the extent that they relate to unearned premium 
commission expense declined in and increased in the decrease in commission expense in was primarily the result of an increase in ceding commissions received as a result of a change in a reinsurance treaty for specialty business coupled with a general decline in commissions paid to brokers and agents 
the increase was caused principally by an increase in premium revenue 
other operating expenses 
the increases in other operating expenses in and of and  respectively  are consistent with revenue growth and attributable primarily to employee related expenses resulting from expansion of the business 
included in was  recorded for employee stock option expense 
the company adopted the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation as of january  included in was an expense reimbursement benefit of  in connection with a claims settlement 
interest expense 
the decreases in interest expense in and were primarily due to lower interest rates charged on the loan balance and a declining loan balance

the effective tax rates for  and were  and  respectively 
as of december  and  the net deferred federal  foreign  state and local tax assets were million and million  respectively 
we had alternative minimum tax carryforwards of  million and million at december    and  respectively 
the alternative minimum tax carryforwards were primarily attributable to the tax benefits from municipal bond interest 
included in and were tax benefits related to the reversal of a tax valuation allowance related to the company s foreign operations of  and  respectively 
the company had a valuation allowance of  as of the year ended december  due to the uncertainty associated with the realization of the deferred tax asset for the carryforward of operating losses from the company s foreign operations 
the company s foreign operations were profitable in and resulting in a portion of the valuation allowance being simultaneously released to the extent of the profits and the first nine months of profits in due to the continued profitability and projected favorable market conditions for the foreseeable future  it was determined to be more likely than not that the deferred tax assets resulting from those net operating loss carryforwards will be realized  therefore the remaining valuation allowance related to the foreign operations was released in the fourth quarter of the company also had net state and local operating loss carryforwards amounting to potential future tax benefits of  and  at december  and  respectively 
a valuation allowance was established for the full amount of these potential future tax benefits due to the uncertainty associated with their realization 
the company s state and local carryforwards at december  expire from to a n n u a l r e p o r t segment information

traditionally  three years have been necessary to report substantially all premiums associated with an underwriting year and to report most related claims  although claims may remain unsettled after the underwriting year is closed 
a lloyd s syndicate typically closes an underwriting year by reinsuring outstanding claims on that underwriting year with the participants for the next underwriting year 
the ceding participants pay the assuming participants an amount based on the unearned premiums and outstanding claims in the underwriting year at the date of the assumption 
our participation in lloyd s syndicate is represented by and recorded as our proportionate share of the underlying assets and liabilities and results of operations of the syndicate since  a we hold an undivided interest in each asset  b we are proportionately liable for each liability and c syndicate is not a separate legal entity 
at lloyd s  the amount to close an underwriting year into the next year is referred to as the reinsurance to close 
the reinsurance to close amounts represent the transfer of the assets and liabilities from the participants of a closing underwriting year to the participants of the next underwriting year 
to the extent our participation in the syndicate changes  the reinsurance to close amounts vary accordingly 
the reinsurance to close transactions are recorded as additional written and earned premium  losses incurred  loss reserves and receivables  all in the same amount 
there are no gains or losses recorded on the transactions 
we provide letters of credit to lloyd s to support our participation in syndicate s capacity 
if we increase our participation  or if lloyd s changes the capital requirements  we may be required to supply additional letters of credit or other collateral acceptable to lloyd s  or reduce the capacity of syndicate the letters of credit are provided through the credit facility which we maintain with a consortium of banks 
the credit facility agreement requires that the banks vote by november th of each year whether or not to renew the letter of credit facility 
if the banks decide not to renew the letter of credit facility  we will need to find other sources to provide the letters of credit or other collateral in order to continue to participate in syndicate the renewal amendment executed in november renewed the letter of credit facility for a two year period expiring in november a n n u a l r e p o r t following are the results of the lloyd s operations for each of the years in the three year period ended december  year ended december  in thousands revenues net earned premium    commission income net investment income    net realized capital gains other income total revenues    operating expenses net losses and loss adjustment expenses    commission expense    other operating expenses    total operating expenses    income loss before income tax expense benefit income tax expense benefit  net income loss    loss and loss expense ratio commission expense ratio other operating expense ratio combined ratio the lloyd s operations have been experiencing business expansion coupled with improving underwriting results as a result of the generally favorable market conditions for marine and energy business since late net earned premium revenues were reduced by million and million in and for business ceded to the insurance companies 
underwriting results in were favorably impacted by million for prior year reserve savings compared to million and million of prior year deficiencies recorded in and  respectively 
the deficiency was due to an increase in premium estimates and related reserves and strengthening of reserves for the underwriting year 
the underwriting results were also adversely impacted by million of pre tax and after tax losses related to the world trade center terrorist attack 
the pre tax yields on funds at lloyd s approximated  and for  and  respectively  which are reflective of the declining interest rate environment since generally  funds invested at lloyd s have been invested with an average duration of approximately years in order to meet liquidity needs 
the provision for income tax expense for and reflect the reversal of a previously established deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
the valuation allowance was reversed up until the fourth quarter of only to the extent of taxable a n n u a l r e p o r t profits 
the remaining valuation allowance was completely reversed in the fourth quarter since it was determined that it was more likely than not that the remaining deferred tax asset resulting from net operating loss carryforwards will be realized 
navigators agencies the navigators agencies produce business for our insurance company subsidiaries 
they specialize in writing marine and related lines of business  specialty liability insurance and professional liability coverages 
each of the navigators agencies underwrites marine and related lines of business for navigators insurance company and three other unaffiliated insurance companies comprising a marine insurance pool 
marine insurance policies are issued by navigators insurance company with the business shared with other pool members 
navigators insurance company had a participation in the pool for business written with effective dates in and as described in more detail under business marine insurance  navigators insurance company s participation in the marine pool increased to for navigators specialty  a division of a navigators agency  produces business exclusively for our insurance company subsidiaries 
it specializes in underwriting general liability insurance coverage for small general and artisan contractors and other targeted commercial risks  with the majority of its business located in california 
navigators specialty also writes surety  commercial multiple peril  commercial automobile and personal umbrella insurance 
navigators pro  a division of a navigators agency  specializes in underwriting professional liability insurance and began producing directors and officers liability insurance exclusively for our insurance company subsidiaries in the fourth quarter of in late  navigators pro introduced additional products to complement its directors and officers liability coverage 
the products include employment practices liability  lawyers professional liability and miscellaneous professional liability coverages 
following are the results of the navigators agencies for each of the years in the three year period ended december  year ended december  in thousands revenues commission income    net investment income other income expense    total revenues    operating expenses other operating expenses    total operating expenses    income loss before income tax expense benefit income tax expense benefit   net income loss   commission income generally consists of intersegment management fees and profit commissions received from insurance premiums of the insurance companies for marine  specialty and professional liability business as well as business from a n n u a l r e p o r t unaffiliated insurance companies in the marine pool 
despite increased premium revenues recorded by the insurance companies in compared to  the commission income of the navigators agencies was flat due to the reduction of million of intersegment profit commission as a result of the million incurred losses recorded by the insurance companies for asbestos and environmental losses 
commission income increased substantially in compared to due to the increased premium revenues generated on behalf of the insurance companies 
net investment income is earned on fiduciary funds 
other income generally represents fee revenues earned for services on behalf of third parties 
other operating costs consists of compensation and general and administrative expenses incurred in connection with underwriting  administrative and claims services performed on behalf of the insurance companies and unaffiliated insurers participating in the marine pool 
such costs have been increasing each year commensurate with servicing the growth in the overall increased premium volume that has been generated in and for the insurance companies and unaffiliated members of the marine pool 
income tax expense benefit includes federal and state income taxes related to the taxable income or loss of the navigators agencies 
the income tax benefit contains a reversal of a prior year accrual that was no longer deemed necessary for a tax contingency

tabular disclosure of contractual obligations the following table sets forth our known contractual obligations with respect to the items indicated at december  payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years in thousands operating leases      capital leases total      investments for a discussion of our investments  see business investments included herein 
liquidity and capital resources cash flow provided by operations was million  million and million for   and  respectively 
the increases in the and operating cash flows were primarily due to the increases in net written premium 
operating cash flow was used primarily to acquire additional investment assets and to reduce debt 
invested assets and cash increased to million at december  from million at december  and million at december  the increases were primarily due to the positive cash flow and the million of net a n n u a l r e p o r t proceeds received from the secondary public stock offering in october net investment income was million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the average yield of the portfolio  excluding net realized capital gains  was in  in and in reflecting the prevailing interest rates during those years 
as of december  and  all fixed maturity securities and equity securities held by us were classified as available for sale 
at december   the weighted average rating of our fixed maturity investments was aa by standard poor s and aa by moody s 
we believe that we have no significant exposure to credit risk since the fixed maturity investment portfolio consists of investment grade bonds 
at december   our portfolio had an average maturity of years and duration of years 
management continually monitors the composition and cash flow of the investment portfolio in order to maintain the appropriate levels of liquidity to ensure our ability to satisfy claims 
we incurred impairment losses of million in and million in on asset backed securities 
we incurred no impairment losses in we have a credit facility provided through a consortium of banks 
the credit facility provides for an million letter of credit facility which was increased from million in november the credit facility also provided for a million line of credit facility which was fully utilized prior to the october common stock offering 
as required by the credit facility agreement  the line of credit was fully paid from a portion of the proceeds from the common stock offering thereby eliminating the line of credit portion of the credit facility 
the letter of credit facility is utilized primarily by navigators corporate underwriters ltd 
and millennium underwriting ltd 
for our participation in lloyd s syndicate the credit facility agreement requires that the banks vote by november th of each year whether or not to renew the letter of credit portion of the facility 
if the banks decide not to renew the letter of credit portion of the facility  we will need to find other sources to provide the letters of credit or other collateral in order to continue our participation in syndicate the renewal amendment executed in november renewed the letter of credit facility for a two year period 
at december   letters of credit with an aggregate face amount of million were issued under the letter of credit facility 
the bank credit facility is collateralized by the common stock of navigators insurance company 
it contains covenants common to transactions of this type  including restrictions on indebtedness and liens  limitations on mergers and the sale of assets  maintaining certain consolidated tangible net worth  statutory surplus and other financial ratios 
at december   we were in compliance with all covenants 
at december   our consolidated stockholders equity was million compared to million at december  the increase was primarily due to the common stock offering and  to a lesser extent  the net income for the year ended december  we had annual rental commitments at december  under various noncancellable operating leases for our office facilities  which expire at various dates through the commitments by year are million for  million for  million for  million for and million for and beyond 
a n n u a l r e p o r t our reinsurance has been placed with various us and foreign insurance companies and with selected syndicates at lloyd s 
pursuant to the implementation of lloyd s plan of reconstruction and renewal  a portion of our recoverables are now reinsured by equitas a separate united kingdom authorized reinsurance company established to reinsure outstanding liabilities of all lloyd s members for all risks written in the or prior years of account 
we primarily rely upon dividends from our subsidiaries to meet our holding company obligations 
the dividends have historically come primarily from navigators insurance company 
at december   the maximum amount available for the payment of dividends by navigators insurance company during without prior regulatory approval was  during  and  navigators insurance company paid dividends to us of   and  respectively 
we believe that the cash flow generated by the operating activities of our subsidiaries will provide sufficient funds for us to meet our liquidity needs over the next twelve months 
beyond the next twelve months  cash flow available to us may be influenced by a variety of factors  including general economic conditions and conditions in the insurance and reinsurance markets  as well as fluctuations from year to year in claims experience 
economic conditions we are a specialty insurance company and periods of moderate economic recession or inflation tend not to have a significant direct affect on our underwriting operations 
they do  however  impact our investment portfolio 
a decrease in interest rates will tend to decrease our yield and have a positive effect on the fair value of our invested assets 
an increase in interest rates will tend to increase our yield and have a negative effect on the fair value of our invested assets 
we also consider the potential impact of economic trends in estimating loss reserves 
our management believes that the underwriting controls it maintains  and the fact that a significant amount of our business is in lines of insurance which have relatively short loss payout patterns  assist in estimating ultimate claim costs more reasonably and lessen the potential adverse impact of the economy on us 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and other relevant market rate or price changes 
market risk is directly influenced by the volatility and liquidity in the markets in which the related underlying assets are traded 
the following is a discussion of our primary market risk exposures and how those exposures have been managed through december  our market risk sensitive instruments are entered into for purposes other than trading 
the carrying value of our investment portfolio as of december  was million of which was invested in fixed maturity securities 
the primary market risk to the investment portfolio is interest rate risk associated with investments in fixed maturity securities 
our exposure to equity price risk and foreign exchange risk is not significant 
we have no commodity risk 
for fixed maturity securities  short term liquidity needs and the potential liquidity needs of the business are key factors in managing the portfolio 
the portfolio duration relative to the liabilities duration is primarily managed through investment transactions 
a n n u a l r e p o r t there were no significant changes regarding the investment portfolio in our primary market risk exposures or in how those exposures were managed between the year ended december  and the year ended december   other than the impairment losses of million in recorded on one of our asset backed securities 
there have been no significant changes in our primary market risk exposures or how those exposures are managed from december  through december we do not currently anticipate significant changes in our primary market risk exposures or in how those exposures are managed in future reporting periods based upon what is known or expected to be in effect in future reporting periods 
sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis is defined as the measurement of potential loss in future earnings  fair values or cash flows of market sensitive instruments resulting from one or more selected hypothetical changes in interest rates and other market rates or prices over a selected time 
in our sensitivity analysis model  a hypothetical change in market rates is selected that is expected to reflect reasonably possible near term changes in those rates 
the term near term means a period of time going forward up to one year from the date of the consolidated financial statements 
actual results may differ from the hypothetical change in market rates assumed in this disclosure  especially since this sensitivity analysis does not reflect the results of any actions that would be taken by us to mitigate such hypothetical losses in fair value 
in this sensitivity analysis model  we use fair values to measure our potential loss 
the sensitivity analysis model includes fixed maturities and short term investments 
the primary market risk to our market sensitive instruments is interest rate risk 
the sensitivity analysis model uses a basis point change in interest rates to measure the hypothetical change in fair value of financial instruments included in the model 
for invested assets  modified duration modeling is used to calculate changes in fair values 
durations on invested assets are adjusted for call  put and interest rate reset features 
duration on tax exempt securities is adjusted for the fact that the yield on such securities is less sensitive to changes in interest rates compared to treasury securities 
invested asset portfolio durations are calculated on a market value weighted basis  including accrued investment income  using holdings as of december  the sensitivity analysis model used by us produces a loss in fair value of market sensitive instruments of million based on a basis point increase in interest rates as of december  this loss amount only reflects the impact of an interest rate increase on the fair value of our fixed maturities and short term investments  which constitute approximately of total assets as of december  the loss in fair value of market sensitive instruments  as a result of a basis point increase in interest rates as of december   is not material 
risk factors in addition to the items listed under note on forward looking statements  following are certain risk factors related to the company 
our business is concentrated in marine and general liability insurance  and if market conditions change adversely  or we experience large losses in these lines  it could have a material adverse effect on our business 
as a result of our strategy to focus on specialty products in niches where we have underwriting and claims handling expertise and to decline business where pricing does not afford what we consider to be acceptable returns  our business is concentrated in the marine and specialty liability lines 
for the year ended december   our marine line accounted for approximately of our gross written premiums and our specialty lines  consisting primarily of contractors liability  accounted for a n n u a l r e p o r t approximately of our gross written premiums 
if our results of operations from either of these two specialty liability lines are less favorable for any reason  including lower demand for our products on terms and conditions that we find appropriate  flat or decreased rates for our products or increased competition  the reduction could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we are exposed to cyclicality in our business that may cause material fluctuations in our results 
the property casualty insurance business generally  and the marine insurance business specifically  have historically been characterized by periods of intense price competition due to excess underwriting capacity as well as periods when shortages of underwriting capacity have permitted attractive premium levels 
we have reduced business during periods of severe competition and price declines  such as withdrawing from the majority of our aviation business in late  and grown when pricing allowed an acceptable return  as with entering the professional liability business in late we expect that our business will continue to experience the effects of this cyclicality  which  over the course of time  could result in material fluctuations in our premium volume  revenues or expenses 
we may not be successful in developing our new specialty lines which could cause us to experience losses 
since  we have entered into a number of new specialty lines of business including professional liability  surety  personal umbrella insurance and commercial automobile insurance 
we continue to look for appropriate opportunities to diversify our business portfolio by offering new lines of insurance in which we believe we have sufficient underwriting and claims expertise 
however  because of our limited history in these new lines  there is limited financial information available to help us estimate sufficient reserve amounts for these lines and to help evaluate whether we will be able to successfully develop these new lines or the likely ultimate losses and expenses associated with these new lines 
due to our limited history in these lines  we may have less experience managing their development and growth than some of our competitors 
additionally  there is a risk that the lines of business into which we expand will not perform at the level we anticipate 
we may be unable to manage effectively our rapid growth in our lines of business  which may adversely affect our results 
we have experienced substantial increases in premium in many of our lines of business over the past few years 
for example  gross written premium in the specialty liability line increased from to  from to and from to due to increased rates and underwriting more business 
gross written premium in the marine line for our insurance companies increased  and in  and  respectively  due to an increase in premium rates resulting in higher premiums on new and renewal business  as well as underwriting new business 
in addition  since late we have been underwriting several new lines of business  including professional liability  surety  commercial automobile and personal umbrella insurance 
to control our growth effectively  we must successfully manage our new and existing lines of business 
this process will require substantial management attention and additional financial resources 
in addition  our growth is subject to  among other risks  the risk that we may experience difficulties and incur expenses related to hiring and retaining a technically proficient workforce 
accordingly  we may fail to realize the intended benefits of expanding into new specialty lines and we may fail to realize value from such lines relative to the resources that we invest in them 
any difficulties associated with expanding our current and future lines of business could adversely affect our result of operations 
a n n u a l r e p o r t we may incur additional losses if our loss reserves are insufficient 
we maintain loss reserves to cover our estimated ultimate unpaid liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses with respect to reported and unreported claims incurred as of the end of each accounting period 
reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability  but instead represent estimates  generally utilizing actuarial projection techniques at a given accounting date 
these reserve estimates are expectations of what the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost based on our assessment of facts and circumstances then known  review of historical settlement patterns  estimates of trends in claims severity  frequency  legal theories of liability and other factors 
both internal and external events  including changes in claims handling procedures  economic inflation  legal trends and legislative changes  may affect the reserve estimation process 
many of these items are not directly quantifiable  particularly on a prospective basis 
additionally  there may be significant lags between the occurrence of the insured event and the time it is actually reported to the insurer 
we continually refine reserve estimates in a regular ongoing process as historical loss experience develops and additional claims are reported and settled 
adjustments to reserves are reflected in the results of the periods in which the estimates are changed 
because establishment of reserves is an inherently uncertain process involving estimates  currently established reserves may not be sufficient 
if estimated reserves are insufficient  we will incur additional income statement charges 
our loss reserves include amounts related to short tail and long tail classes of business 
short tail business means that claims are generally reported quickly upon occurrence of an event  making estimation of loss reserves less complex 
for the long tail lines  significant periods of time  ranging up to several years or more  may elapse between the occurrence of the loss  the reporting of the loss and the settlement of the claim 
the longer the time span between the incidence of a loss and the settlement of the claim  the more likely the ultimate settlement amount will vary 
our longer tail business includes general liability  including california construction defect claims  as well as historical claims for asbestos and environmental exposures through our marine and aviation businesses and claims relating to our run off businesses 
as of december  and  our net loss reserves for the asbestos and environmental exposures were million and million  respectively 
navigators insurance company increased its gross and net asbestos reserves for losses by approximately million and million  respectively  in the fourth quarter of as a result  gross and net incurred losses increased by the amount of the respective reserve increase 
our professional liability business  though long tail with respect to settlement period  is produced on a claims made basis which means that the policy in force at the time the claim is filed  rather than the policy in force at the time the loss occurred  provides coverage and is therefore  we believe  less likely to result in a time lag between the occurrence of the loss and the reporting of the loss 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will not suffer substantial adverse prior period development in our business in the future 
we may not have access to adequate reinsurance to protect us against losses 
we purchase reinsurance by transferring part of the risk we have assumed to a reinsurance company in exchange for part of the premium we receive in connection with the risk 
the availability and cost of reinsurance are subject to prevailing market conditions  both in terms of price and available capacity  which can affect our business volume and profitability 
since the september  terrorist attacks  we have seen  and expect to continue to see  a significant tightening in the pricing and terms and conditions for reinsurance in some of our lines of business 
our reinsurance programs are generally subject to renewal on an annual basis 
if we are unable to renew our expiring facilities or to obtain new reinsurance facilities  either our net exposures would increase  which could increase our costs  or  if we were unwilling to bear an increase in net exposures  we would have to reduce the level of our underwriting commitments  especially catastrophe exposed risks  which would reduce our revenues and possibly net income 
a n n u a l r e p o r t our reinsurers  including the other participants in the marine pool  may not pay on losses in a timely fashion  or at all  which may increase our costs 
although reinsurance makes the reinsurer liable to us to the extent the risk is transferred or ceded to the reinsurer  ceded reinsurance arrangements do not eliminate our obligation to pay claims to our policyholders 
accordingly  we bear credit risk with respect to our reinsurers 
specifically  our reinsurers may not pay claims made by us on a timely basis  or they may not pay some or all of these claims 
either of these events would increase our costs and could have a material adverse effect on our business 
the operations of the marine pool also expose us to reinsurance credit risk 
since  all business underwritten by the marine pool has been written with navigators insurance company as the primary insurer 
navigators insurance company then reinsures its exposure in the marine pool to the other participants based on their percentage participation 
from until  navigators insurance company was the primary insurer for some of the pool business in excess of its participation amount 
as a result of this arrangement  we remain primarily liable for claims arising out of those policies written by navigators insurance company on behalf of the marine pool even if one or more of the other participants do not pay the claims they reinsured  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
intense competition for our products could harm our ability to maintain or increase our profitability and premium volume 
the property and casualty insurance industry is highly competitive 
we face competition from both domestic and foreign insurers  many of whom have longer operating histories and greater financial  marketing and management resources 
competition in the types of insurance in which we are engaged is based on many factors  including our perceived overall financial strength  pricing and other terms and conditions of products and services offered  business experience  marketing and distribution arrangements  agency and broker relationships  levels of customer service including speed of claims payments  product differentiation and quality  operating efficiencies and underwriting 
furthermore  insureds tend to favor large  financially strong insurers  and we face the risk that we will lose market share to higher rated insurers 
the entry of banks and brokerage firms into the insurance business poses new challenges for insurance companies and agents 
these challenges from industries traditionally outside the insurance business could heighten the competition in the property and casualty industry 
we may have difficulty in continuing to compete successfully on any of these bases in the future 
if competition limits our ability to write new business at adequate rates  our ability to transact business would be materially and adversely affected and our results of operations would be adversely affected 
we may be unable to attract and retain qualified employees 
we depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified executive officers  experienced underwriters and claims professionals and other skilled employees who are knowledgeable about our specialty lines of business 
if the quality of our executive officers  underwriting or claims team and other personnel decreases  we may be unable to maintain our current competitive position in the specialty markets in which we operate and be unable to expand our operations into new specialty markets 
increases in interest rates may cause us to experience losses 
because of the unpredictable nature of losses that may arise under insurance policies  we may require substantial liquidity at any time 
our investment portfolio  which is comprised largely of fixed income investments  is our principal source of liquidity 
a n n u a l r e p o r t the market value of our fixed income investments is subject to fluctuation depending on changes in prevailing interest rates and various other factors 
we do not hedge our investment portfolio against interest rate risk 
increases in interest rates during periods when we must sell fixed income securities to satisfy liquidity needs may result in realized losses 
a downgrade in our ratings could adversely impact the competitive positions of our operating businesses 
ratings are a critical factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies 
our insurance companies are rated by am best company and s p 
am best company s and s p s ratings reflect their opinions of an insurance company s financial strength  operating performance  strategic position and ability to meet its obligations to policyholders  and are not evaluations directed to investors 
our ratings are subject to periodic review by am best company and s p  and we cannot assure the continued maintenance of our current ratings 
in  am best company reaffirmed its a excellent rating for navigators insurance company and nic insurance company 
in  s p s reaffirmed its a strong rating for navigators insurance company and nic insurance company 
because these ratings have become an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies  if these ratings are reduced  our competitive position in the industry  and therefore our business  could be adversely affected 
a significant downgrade could result in a substantial loss of business as policyholders might move to other companies with higher claims paying and financial strength ratings 
there can be no assurance that our current ratings will continue for any given period of time 
our business could be materially and adversely affected if lloyd s was further downgraded by am best 
following the september  terrorist attacks  the lloyd s of london market was downgraded by am best to a excellent from a 
on april   am best company affirmed lloyd s a rating 
our lloyd s operations ability to market insurance policies to certain customers and brokers is dependent  in part  upon lloyd s maintaining an a or better am best rating 
am best company s rating of the lloyd s of london market is not a rating of our lloyd s operations 
in the event that lloyd s rating is further downgraded for any reason  it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to underwrite business through our lloyd s operations and therefore on our financial condition or results of operations 
continued or increased premium levies by lloyd s for the lloyd s central fund and cash calls for trust fund deposits could materially and adversely affect us 
the lloyd s central fund protects lloyd s policyholders against the failure of a member of lloyd s to meet its obligations 
the central fund is a mechanism which in effect mutualizes unpaid liabilities among all members  whether individual or corporate 
the fund is available to back lloyd s policies issued after lloyd s requires members to contribute to the central fund  normally in the form of an annual contribution  although a special contribution may be levied 
the council of lloyd s has discretion to call up to of underwriting capacity in any one year 
policies issued before have been reinsured by equitas  an independent insurance company authorized by the financial services authority 
however  if equitas were to fail or otherwise be unable to meet all of its obligations  lloyd s may take the view that it is appropriate to apply the central fund to discharge those liabilities equitas failed to meet 
in that case  the council of lloyd s may resolve to impose a special or additional levy on the existing members  including lloyd s corporate members  to satisfy those liabilities 
additionally  lloyd s insurance and reinsurance business is subject to local regulation  and regulators in the united states require lloyd s to maintain certain minimum deposits in trust funds as protection for policyholders in the united states 
these a n n u a l r e p o r t deposits may be used to cover liabilities in the event of a major claim arising in the united states and lloyd s may require us to satisfy cash calls to meet claims payment obligations and maintain minimum trust fund amounts 
any premium levy or cash call would increase the expenses of millennium underwriting ltd 
and navigators corporate underwriters ltd  our corporate members  without providing compensating revenues  and could have a material adverse effect on our results 
our businesses are heavily regulated  and changes in regulation may reduce our profitability and limit our growth 
our insurance subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation and supervision in the jurisdictions in which they conduct business 
this regulation is generally designed to protect the interests of policyholders  as opposed to insurers and their stockholders and other investors  and relates to authorization for lines of business  capital and surplus requirements  investment limitations  underwriting limitations  transactions with affiliates  dividend limitations  changes in control  premium rates and a variety of other financial and nonfinancial components of an insurance company s business 
virtually all states require insurers licensed to do business in that state to bear a portion of the loss suffered by some insureds as the result of impaired or insolvent insurance companies 
the effect of these arrangements could reduce our profitability in any given period or limit our ability to grow our business 
in recent years  the state insurance regulatory framework has come under increased federal scrutiny  and some state legislatures have considered or enacted laws that may alter or increase state authority to regulate insurance companies and insurance holding companies 
further  the national association of insurance commissioners  or naic  and state insurance regulators are re examining existing laws and regulations  specifically focusing on modifications to holding company regulations  interpretations of existing laws and the development of new laws 
any proposed or future legislation or naic initiatives may be more restrictive than current regulatory requirements or may result in higher costs 
in response to the september  terrorist attacks  the united states congress has enacted legislation designed to ensure  among other things  the availability of insurance coverage for terrorist acts  including the requirement that insurers provide such coverage in certain circumstances 
the terrorism risk insurance act of tria established a program under which the federal government will share the risk of loss from certain acts of international terrorism with the insurance industry 
as a result  we will be prohibited from adding certain terrorism exclusion clauses to the policies written by insurers in our group that write business in the us while these insurers are protected by federally funded terrorism reinsurance as provided for in the tria  there is a substantial deductible that must be met  the payment of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
potential future changes to the tria could also adversely affect us by causing our reinsurers to increase prices or withdraw from certain markets where terrorism coverage is required 
the inability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to us in sufficient amounts would harm our ability to meet our obligations 
we are a holding company and rely primarily on dividends from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations for payment of interest and principal on outstanding debt obligations and corporate expenses 
the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to us in the future will depend on their statutory surplus  on earnings and on regulatory restrictions 
for a discussion of our insurance subsidiaries current dividend paying ability  please see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources included herein 
we and our underwriting subsidiaries are subject to regulation by some states as an insurance holding company 
such regulation generally provides that transactions between companies within our consolidated group must be fair and equitable 
transfers of assets among affiliated a n n u a l r e p o r t companies  certain dividend payments from underwriting subsidiaries and certain material transactions between companies within our consolidated group may be subject to prior notice to  or prior approval by  state regulatory authorities 
our underwriting subsidiaries are also subject to licensing and supervision by government regulatory agencies in the jurisdictions in which they do business 
these regulations may set standards of solvency that must be met and maintained  such as the nature of and limitations on investments  the nature of and limitations on dividends to policyholders and stockholders and the nature and extent of required participation in insurance guaranty funds 
these regulations may affect our subsidiaries ability to provide us with dividends 
catastrophe losses could materially reduce our profitability 
we are exposed to claims arising out of catastrophes  particularly in our marine insurance line of business 
we have experienced  and will in the future experience  catastrophe losses which may materially reduce our profitability or harm our financial condition 
catastrophes can be caused by various natural events  including hurricanes  windstorms  earthquakes  hail  severe winter weather and fires 
catastrophes can also be man made  such as the world trade center attack 
the incidence and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable 
although we will attempt to manage our exposure to such events  the frequency and severity of catastrophic events could exceed our estimates  either of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition
