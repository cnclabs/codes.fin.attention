the company expects to continue the payment of quarterly dividends  however  the continued payment and amount of cash dividends will depend upon  among other factors  the company s operating results  overall financial condition  capital requirements and general business conditions 
as a holding company  mercury general is largely dependent upon dividends from its subsidiaries to pay dividends to its shareholders 
these subsidiaries are subject to state laws that restrict their ability to distribute dividends 
the state laws permit a casualty insurance company to pay dividends and advances within any month period  without any prior regulatory approval  in an amount up to the greater of of statutory earned surplus at the preceding december  or statutory net income for the calendar year preceding the date the dividend is paid 
under this test  the direct insurance subsidiaries of the company are entitled to pay dividends to mercury general during of up to approximately million

the company also offers homeowners insurance  mechanical breakdown insurance  commercial and dwelling fire insurance  umbrella insurance  commercial automobile and commercial property insurance 
the private passenger automobile lines of insurance accounted for approximately of the billion of the company s gross written premiums in  with of the private passenger automobile premiums written in california 
this overview discusses some of the relevant factors that management considers in evaluating the company s performance  prospects and risks 
it is not all inclusive and is meant to be read in conjunction with the entirety of the management discussion and analysis  the company s financial statements and notes thereto and all other items contained within the report on this annual report on form k 
economic and industry wide factors regulatory the insurance industry is subject to strict state regulation and oversight and is governed by the laws of each state in which each insurance company operates 
state regulators generally have substantial power and authority over insurance companies including  in some states  approving rate changes and rating factors and establishing minimum capital and surplus requirements 
in many states  the insurance commissioner is an elected office and newly elected commissioners may emphasize different agendas or interpret existing regulations differently than previous commissioners 
in california  the company s largest market  the current commissioner took office in january of he has made changes more actively than the previous commissioner in the way automobile insurance is regulated in california 
it is uncertain how any regulatory changes implemented by the california insurance commissioner  or the insurance commissioner in any other state in which mercury operates  will be resolved and how it will impact the company s operations 
cost uncertainty because insurance companies pay claims after premiums are collected  the ultimate cost of an insurance policy is not known until well after the policy revenues are earned 
consequently  significant assumptions are made when establishing insurance rates and loss reserves 
while insurance companies use sophisticated models and experienced actuaries to assist in setting rates and establishing loss reserves  there can be no assurance that current rates or current reserve estimates will be adequate 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that insurance regulators will approve rate increases when the company s actuarial analysis shows that they are needed 
inflation the largest cost component for automobile insurers are losses which include medical costs and replacement automobile parts and labor repair costs 
there has recently been a significant increase in medical cost inflation and it is often a year or more after the respective fiscal period ends before sufficient claims have closed for the inflation rate to be known with a reasonable degree of certainty 
therefore  it can be difficult to establish reserves and set premium rates  particularly when actual inflation rates are higher or lower than anticipated 
the company currently estimates mid to high single digit inflation rates on bodily injury coverages for its major california personal automobile lines for the and accident years 
the inflation rate for these accident years is the most difficult to estimate because there remain many open claims 
should actual inflation be higher the company could be under reserved for its losses and profit margins would be lower 
loss frequency another component of overall loss costs is loss frequency  which is the number of claims per risks insured 
there has been a long term trend of declining loss frequency in the personal automobile insurance industry  which has benefited the industry as a whole 
however  it is unknown if loss frequency in the future will continue to decline  remain flat or increase 
underwriting cycle and competition the property and casualty insurance industry is highly cyclical  with periods of rising premium rates and shortages of underwriting capacity hard market followed by periods of substantial price competition and excess capacity soft market 
the company has historically seen premium growth in excess of during hard markets  whereas premium growth rates during soft markets have historically been in the single digits 
many of the company s major competitors have announced better operating results in  which typically signals a softening in the market  and consequently  the company expects that its policies in force will be difficult to grow in  particularly in california 
the company expects to offset some of this expected reduction in growth through expansion into new states 
revenues  income and cash generation the company generates its revenues through the sale of insurance policies  primarily covering personal automobile and homeowners 
these policies are sold through independent agents and brokers who receive a commission on average for selling and servicing the policies 
the company believes that the relationship with its brokers and agents along with a more thorough underwriting process gives the company an advantage over its competitors 
the company views this as one of its primary competitive advantages because it allows the company to charge lower prices yet realize better margins 
the company also generates revenue from its investment portfolio  which was approximately billion at the end of this investment portfolio generated million in pre tax investment income during the portfolio is managed by company personnel with a view towards maximizing after tax yields and limiting interest rate and credit risk 
the company s results and growth have allowed it to consistently generate positive cash flow from operations  which was million in the company s cash flow from operations has exceeded million every year since and has been positive for over years 
cash flows from operations has been used to pay shareholder dividends and to help support growth 
opportunities  challenges and risks the company currently underwrites personal automobile insurance in nine states  california  florida  texas  oklahoma  georgia  illinois  new york  virginia and beginning in august of  new jersey 
the company believes that there are opportunities to expand its business into additional states and expects to begin writing business in arizona and possibly other states by the end of the company expects to continue this growth by expanding into new states in future years with the objective for non california premiums to eventually account for as much as half of the company s total premiums 
there are  however  challenges and risks involved in entering each new state  including establishing adequate rates without any operating history in the state  working with a new regulatory regime  hiring and training competent personnel  building adequate systems and finding qualified agents to represent the company 
the company has entered five new states during the past six years and believes that it has sufficient expertise to manage these challenges and risks to continue its expansion into additional new states 
the company is also subject to some risks inherent to its business  which might include but are not limited to the following a catastrophe  such as a major wildfire  earthquake or hurricane can cause a significant amount of loss to the company in a very short period of time 
a major regulatory change  such as the reinstatement of third party bad faith lawsuits could cause a dramatic increase in loss costs 
a sharp upward increase in market interest rates or an equity market crash could cause a significant loss to our investment portfolio 
to the extent that is within the company s control  the company manages these risks and believes that it has established adequate controls to mitigate the effect that major events would have on the company s financial position 
the company is currently developing a next generation nextgen computer system to replace its existing legacy systems that currently reside on hewlett packard mainframe computers 
the nextgen system is being designed to be a multi state  multi line system that is expected to enable the company to enter new states more rapidly  as well as respond to legislative and regulatory changes more easily than the company s current system 
the nextgen project is in the development phase and is not expected to be in operation until or the nextgen system is expected to cost approximately million and to provide a significant positive benefit to the company 
general the operating results of property and casualty insurance companies are subject to significant fluctuations from quarter to quarter and from year to year due to the effect of competition on pricing  the frequency and severity of losses  including the effect of natural disasters on losses  general economic conditions  the general regulatory environment in those states in which an insurer operates  state regulation of premium rates and other factors such as changes in tax laws 
the property and casualty industry has been highly cyclical  with periods of high premium rates and shortages of underwriting capacity followed by periods of severe price competition and excess capacity 
these cycles can have a large impact on the ability of the company to grow and retain business 
the company operates primarily in the state of california  which was the only state it produced business in prior to the company expanded its operations into georgia and illinois in with the acquisition of american fidelity insurance group afi in december  now american mercury insurance company ami  the company expanded into the states of oklahoma and texas 
the company expanded its operations into the state of florida during and further expansion into texas occurred with the concord insurance services  inc transaction in december and the mercury county mutual insurance company mcm transaction in september in  the company expanded into virginia and new york 
the company expanded its operations into new jersey during during  approximately of the company s total net premiums written were derived from california 
implementing rate changes varies by state with california  georgia  new york and new jersey requiring prior approval from the doi before a rate can be implemented 
illinois  texas and virginia only require that rates be filed with the doi  while oklahoma and florida have a modified version of prior approval laws 
in all states  the insurance code provides that rates must not be excessive  inadequate or unfairly discriminatory 
effective june   the company implemented a rate increase for new and renewal california private passenger automobile insurance written by mercury insurance company mic  which represents approximately of company wide premiums written  and a combined rate increase for new and renewal california private passenger automobile insurance written by mercury casualty company mcc and california automobile insurance company cal auto  which represent approximately of company wide premiums written 
during  the company also implemented automobile insurance rate increases in four of the eight non california states 
despite the increases  the company believes that its rates will remain competitive in the marketplace 
during  the company continued its marketing efforts for name recognition and lead generation 
the company believes that its marketing effort combined with price and reputation makes the company very competitive in california 
since december   the company s private passenger automobile policies in force in california have experienced an average annual growth rate of approximately with a growth rate of in the company s non california private passenger automobile policies in force have experienced an average annual growth rate of approximately since december  with a growth rate of in management believes the increase is due in large part to a hard insurance market  the company s expansion into new states  favorable competitive rates  a good reputation and a highly visible and targeted advertising strategy 
the california insurance commissioner uses rating factor regulations requiring automobile insurance rates to be determined by driving safety record  miles driven per year  years of driving experience and whatever optional factors are determined by the insurance commissioner to have a substantial relationship to the risk of loss and adopted by regulation 
the regulations further require that each of the four factors be applied in decreasing order of importance 
the california insurance commissioner is conducting townhall meetings to discuss modifying territory as a rating factor 
the outcome of this matter is uncertain and the impact to the company can not be determined at this time 
the california doi required all insurers offering persistency discounts to make class plan filings by january   removing the portability of these discounts 
persistency discounts represent discounts on policy rates extended to consumers based upon the number of consecutive years that the consumers carried insurance coverage 
these class plans were never implemented because senate bill was enacted during amending the california insurance code to allow insurers to offer products with portable persistency discounts 
however  in january  this legislation was overturned through judicial proceedings in the los angeles superior court 
the company intervened in the original proceedings and intends to seek appellate review of this ruling 
the outcome of such action is uncertain 
the changes made during the class plan filing indicated that removing persistency discounts is revenue neutral for the company s existing business 
the removal of persistency discounts could have an impact on the company s price competitiveness in attracting new business and would cause many existing customer s rates to change 
however  this impact  if any  is undeterminable 
on june   the california state board of equalization sbe upheld notices of proposed assessment npas issued against the company for tax years through in the npa s  the california franchise tax board ftb disallowed a portion of the company s expenses related to management services provided to its insurance company subsidiaries on grounds that such portion was allocable to the company s tax deductible dividends from such subsidiaries 
the total tax liability and interest on the management fee expenses amount to approximately million approximately million tax liability plus million of interest through december  
the potential net liability  after federal tax benefit  amounts to approximately million 
the company continues to believe that its deduction of the expenses related to management services provided to it subsidiaries is meritorious and will continue to defend it vigorously before the sbe and  if necessary  the courts 
the company has filed a petition for rehearing with the sbe based both on procedural and substantive grounds  and both the company and the ftb have filed briefs relating to the petition 
the sbe is expected to consider the matter in march the sbe decision on the npa s for tax years through also resulted in a smaller disallowance of the company s interest expense deductions than was proposed by the ftb in those years 
the company has decided not to continue to challenge this issue and has established a small accrual for the tax liability and related interest 
as a result of the court ruling in ceridian vs 
franchise tax board  the ftb has issued npas for tax years through disallowing all dividend received deductions drd taken by the company for those tax years 
the ruling in ceridian vs 
franchise tax board held the statute permitting the tax deductibility of dividends received from wholly owned insurance subsidiaries unconstitutional because it discriminated against out of state holding companies 
the ftb interpretation of the ruling concludes that the discriminatory sections of the statute are not severable and the entire statute is invalid 
as a result  the ftb s position in the npas is that all dividends received by the company from its insurance company subsidiaries are subject to california franchise taxes 
the drd disallowance could result in approximately million of additional california state franchise taxes plus million of related interest through december  the potential net liability  after federal tax benefit  amounts to approximately million 
management intends to vigorously challenge these potential tax liabilities on and future inter company dividends 
however  if the company s challenges are ineffective or the issue is not resolved favorably with the state of california  additional state taxes of approximately after the federal tax benefit of deducting state taxes could be owed on dividends mercury general receives from its insurance subsidiaries 
while the company intends to continue paying dividends to its shareholders  an unsatisfactory conclusion to the inter company dividend issue could affect future dividend policy 
the company is closely following the progress of legislation that if enacted would resolve the issues on expense disallowance and eliminate the uncertainty created by the court ruling in ceridian vs 
franchise tax board for all tax years through december  without a legislative solution  years of future litigation may be required to determine the ultimate outcome of the expense disallowance and drd issues 
because of the uncertainty surrounding these issues  it is difficult to predict the ultimate amount the company may be required to pay  if anything 
consistent with the proposed legislation and the company s expectations of a legislative solution  the company has established a tax contingency reserve of approximately million  net of federal tax benefits  for all california franchise tax issues including the disallowance of expenses and drd issues 
the company is also involved in proceedings incidental to its insurance business see item legal proceedings  and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies the preparation of the company s financial statements requires judgment and estimates 
the most significant is the estimate of loss reserves as required by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises sfas no 
and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies sfas no 

estimating loss reserves is a difficult process as there are many factors that can ultimately affect the final settlement of a claim and  therefore  the reserve that is needed 
changes in the regulatory and legal environment  results of litigation  medical costs  the cost of repair materials and labor rates can all impact ultimate claim costs 
in addition  time can be a critical part of reserving determinations since the longer the span between the incidence of a loss and the payment or settlement of the claim  the more variable the ultimate settlement amount can be 
accordingly  short tail claims  such as property damage claims  tend to be more reasonably predictable than long tail liability claims 
inflation is reflected in the reserving process through analysis of cost trends and reviews of historical reserving results 
the company performs its own loss reserve analysis and also engages the services of an independent actuary to assist in the estimation of loss reserves 
the company and the actuary do not calculate a range of loss reserve estimates but rather calculate a point estimate 
management reviews the underlying factors and assumptions that serve as the basis for preparing the reserve estimate 
these include paid and incurred loss development factors  expected average costs per claim  inflation trends  expected loss ratios  industry data and other relevant information 
at december   the company recorded million in loss and loss adjustment expense reserves 
management believes that the liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses is adequate to cover the ultimate net cost of losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred to date 
since the provisions are necessarily based upon estimates  the ultimate liability may be more or less than such provision 
the company complies with the sfas no 
definition of how insurance enterprises should recognize revenue on insurance policies written 
the company s insurance premiums are recognized as income ratably over the term of the policies 
unearned premiums are carried as a liability on the balance sheet and are computed on a monthly pro rata basis 
the company evaluates its unearned premiums periodically for premium deficiencies by comparing the sum of expected claim costs  unamortized acquisition costs and maintenance costs to related unearned premiums 
to the extent that any of the company s lines of business become substantially unprofitable  then a premium deficiency reserve may be required 
the company does not expect this to occur on any of its significant lines of business 
the company carries its fixed maturity and equity investments at market value as required for securities classified as available for sale by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities sfas no 

in most cases  market valuations were drawn from trade data sources 
in no case were any valuations made by the company s management 
equity holdings  including non sinking fund preferred stocks  are  with minor exceptions  actively traded on national exchanges  and were valued at the last transaction price on the balance sheet date 
the company constantly evaluates its investments for other than temporary declines and writes them off as realized losses through the statement of income  as required by sfas no 
when recovery of the net book value appears doubtful 
temporary unrealized investment gains and losses are credited or charged directly to shareholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income  net of applicable taxes 
it is possible that future information will become available about the company s current investments that would require accounting for them as realized losses due to other than temporary declines in value 
the financial statement effect would be to move the unrealized loss from accumulated other comprehensive income on the balance sheet to realized investment losses on the statement of income 
the company may have certain known and unknown potential liabilities that are evaluated using the criteria established by sfas no 
these include claims  assessments or lawsuits incidental to our business 
the company continually evaluates these potential liabilities and accrues for them or discloses them in the financial statement footnotes if they meet the requirements stated in sfas no 
while it is not possible to know with certainty the ultimate outcome of contingent liabilities  management does not expect them to have a material effect on the consolidated operations or financial position 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations sfas no 
and statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
became effective january  sfas no 
requires companies to apply the purchase method of accounting for all business combinations initiated after june  and prohibits the use of the pooling of interest method 
sfas no 
changes the method by which companies may recognize intangible assets in purchase business combinations and generally requires identifiable intangible assets to be recognized separately from goodwill 
in addition  it eliminates the amortization of all existing and newly acquired goodwill on a prospective basis and requires companies to assess goodwill for impairment  at least annually  based on the fair value of the reporting unit 
at december   the company had on its books approximately million in goodwill related to the acquisition of concord and approximately million of intangible assets with indefinite useful lives related to the mcm acquisition 
as required by sfas no 
 the company has assessed these assets and determined that they are not impaired 
furthermore  as required by sfas no 
 the company did not amortize these assets after total amortization expense in related to these assets was million 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  premiums earned in of  million increased from the corresponding period in net premiums written in of  million increased over amounts written in the premium increases were principally attributable to increased policy sales and rate increases in the california  florida and texas automobile lines and the california homeowners insurance lines of business 
net premiums written is a non gaap financial measure which represents the premiums charged on policies issued during a fiscal period less any reinsurance 
net premiums written is a statutory measure used to determine production levels 
net premiums earned  the most directly comparable gaap measure  represents the portion of premiums written that are recognized as income in the financial statements for the period presented and earned on a pro rata basis over the term of the policies 
the following is a reconciliation of total company net premiums written to net premiums earned s for the years ended december  and  respectively net premiums written increase in unearned premiums earned premiums the loss ratio gaap basis in loss and loss adjustment expenses related to premiums earned was in compared with in the lower loss ratio is largely attributable to recent rate increases and improved loss frequency on automobile claims as well as california homeowners claims 
automobile loss frequencies can be affected by many factors including seasonal travel  weather and fluctuations in gasoline prices 
the southern california firestorms negatively impacted the loss ratio by in furthermore  adverse development on prior accident years increased the loss ratio by and the loss ratio by 
the expense ratio gaap basis in policy acquisition costs and other operating expenses related to premiums earned was compared with in the increase in the expense ratio is primarily due to higher profitability related bonus accruals 
the combined ratio of losses and expenses gaap basis is the key measure of underwriting performance traditionally used in the property and casualty insurance industry 
a combined ratio under generally reflects profitable underwriting results  a combined ratio over generally reflects unprofitable underwriting results

net realized investment gains in were million  compared with net realized losses of million in included in the net realized investment gains losses are investment write downs of million in and million in that the company considered to be other than temporarily impaired 
the investment write downs were on investments primarily in the telecommunications and energy sectors and are discussed further under liquidity and capital resources 
the income tax provision of million in represented an effective tax rate of which compares with an effective tax rate of in after excluding the effect of net realized investment gains losses in both years 
the higher rate is primarily attributable to the increased proportion of underwriting income which is taxed at the full corporate rate of in contrast with investment income which includes tax exempt interest and tax sheltered dividend income

the company and virtually all of its competitors filed and implemented rate increases  which helped spur the company s premium growth during the year 
the gaap loss ratio in loss and loss adjustment expenses related to premiums earned was compared with in the lower loss ratio was primarily driven by rate increases which were partially offset by rising loss severity trends and adverse loss development from prior periods 
the gaap expense ratio policy acquisition costs and other operating expenses related to premiums earned was in and in while expenses generally increased in  the increase was at a slightly lower rate than the increase in premium volume

under current insurance law  mercury general s insurance subsidiaries are entitled to pay  without extraordinary approval  dividends of approximately million in the actual amount of dividends paid from insurance subsidiaries to mercury general during was million 
as of december   mercury general also had approximately million in fixed maturity securities  equity securities and cash that can be utilized to satisfy its direct holding company obligations 
the principal sources of funds for mercury general s insurance subsidiaries are premiums  sales and maturity of invested assets and dividend and interest income from invested assets 
the principal uses of funds for mercury general s insurance subsidiaries are the payment of claims and related expenses  operating expenses  dividends to mercury general and the purchase of investments 
mercury general s insurance subsidiaries generate substantial positive cash flows  particularly when the company experiences growth  from operations as premiums are typically received in advance of the time when claim payments are required 
cash and short term cash investments increased by nearly million as the company has managed its portfolio to a shorter portfolio duration as a result of the current interest rate environment 
net cash provided from operating activities in was million  an increase of million over the same period in this increase was primarily due to the growth in premiums reflecting increases in both policy sales and rates partially offset by an increase in loss and loss adjustment expenses paid in the company has utilized the cash provided from operating activities primarily to increase its investment in fixed maturity securities  the construction of an additional office facility during  the purchase and development of information technology and the payment of dividends to its shareholders 
excess cash was invested in short term cash investments 
funds derived from the sale  redemption or maturity of fixed maturity investments of million  were primarily reinvested by the company in high grade fixed maturity securities 
the company s cash and short term cash investment portfolio totaled million at december  together with cash flows from operations  the company believes that such liquid assets are adequate to satisfy its liquidity requirements without the forced sale of investments 
however  the company operates in a rapidly evolving and often unpredictable business environment that may change the timing or amount of expected future cash receipts and expenditures 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the company s sources of funds will be sufficient to meet its liquidity needs or that the company will not be required to raise additional funds to meet those needs  including future business expansion  through the sale of equity or debt securities or from credit facilities with lending institutions 
the market value of all investments fixed maturities and equities held at market as available for sale exceeded amortized cost of  million at december  by million 
that net unrealized gain of million  reflected in shareholders equity  net of applicable tax effects  was million at december   compared with a net unrealized gain of million of december  the increase in unrealized gains is largely due to an increase in the market value of bond holdings resulting from the current interest rate environment and the partial recovery in value of previously written down equity securities 
at december   the average rating of the  million bond portfolio at market amortized cost  million was aa  the same average rating at december  bond holdings are broadly diversified geographically  within the tax exempt sector

the board of directors has authorized the company s management to commence selling put options in and to increase its option writing program up to million 
the company monitors its investments closely 
if an unrealized loss is determined to be other than temporary it is written off as a realized loss through the consolidated statement of income 
the company s methodology of assessing other than temporary impairments is based on security specific analysis as of the balance sheet date and considers various factors including the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than the cost  the financial condition and the near term prospects of the issuer  whether the debtor is current on its contractually obligated interest and principal payments  and the company s intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow the company to recover its costs 
during  the company recognized approximately million in net realized gains from the disposal sale  call or maturity of securities which is comprised of realized gains of million offset by realized losses of million 
these realized losses were derived from the disposal of securities with a total amortized cost of approximately million 
approximately million of the million total realized loss relates to securities held as of december with no loss on any one individual security exceeding million 
the company recognized million and million in realized losses as other than temporary declines to its investment securities during and  respectively 
of the million write down recognized in  approximately million relates to fixed maturity securities for a single company that filed for bankruptcy protection in july at such time  the company liquidated its investment and recognized an impairment loss equal to the difference between the net proceeds on liquidation and the amortized cost of the investment 
the balance of the write down recognized relates to four equity securities whose book value materially exceeded market value for more than six consecutive months and the company considered it unlikely that the market value would recover 
at december   the company had a net unrealized gain on all investments of million before income taxes which is comprised of unrealized gains of million offset by unrealized losses of million 
unrealized losses represent of total investments at amortized cost 
of these unrealized losses  approximately million relate to fixed maturity investments and the remaining million relate to equity securities 
approximately million of the unrealized losses are represented by a large number of individual securities with unrealized losses of less than of each security s amortized cost 
of these  the most significant unrealized losses relate to one corporate bond and one municipal bond with unrealized losses of approximately million and million  respectively  representing market value declines of and of amortized cost 
the remaining million represents unrealized losses that exceed of amortized costs and are discussed further below 
the company has concluded that the gross unrealized losses of million at december  were temporary in nature 
however  facts and circumstances may change which could result in a decline in market value considered to be other than temporary

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s the company is subject to various market risk exposures including interest rate risk and equity price risk 
the following disclosure reflects estimates of future performance and economic conditions 
actual results may differ 
the company invests its assets primarily in fixed maturity investments  which at december  comprised of total investments at market value 
tax exempt bonds represent of the fixed maturity investments with the remaining amount consisting of sinking fund preferred stocks and taxable bonds 
equity securities account for of total investments at market 
the remaining of the investment portfolio consists of highly liquid short term investments which are primarily short term money market funds 
the value of the fixed maturity portfolio is subject to interest rate risk 
as market interest rates decrease  the value of the portfolio goes up with the opposite holding true in rising interest rate environments 
a common measure of the interest sensitivity of fixed maturity assets is modified duration  a calculation that takes maturity  coupon rate  yield and call terms to calculate an average age of the expected cash flows 
the longer the duration  the more sensitive the asset is to market interest rate fluctuations 
the company historically invested in fixed maturity investments with a goal towards maximizing after tax yields and holding assets to the maturity or call date 
since assets with longer maturity dates tend to produce higher current yields  the company s investment philosophy resulted in a portfolio with a moderate duration 
however  due to the current interest rate environment  management believes it prudent to reduce the duration of the company s bond portfolio 
bond investments made by the company typically have call options attached  which further reduce the duration of the asset as interest rates decline 
consequently  the modified duration of the bond portfolio declined from years at december  to years at december  given a hypothetical parallel increase of basis points in interest rates  the fair value of the bond portfolio would decrease by approximately million 
at december   approximately of the fixed maturity portfolio includes us government agency collateralized mortgage obligations cmos with aaa ratings from standard poors 
the company invests in cmos to strategically increase its current cash flows from investments 
the average duration and effective maturity for these securities are years and years  respectively 
the company does not expect that its investments in cmos to grow beyond of its total investment portfolio 
at december   the company s strategy for common equity investments is an active strategy which focuses on current income with a secondary focus on capital appreciation 
the value of the common equity investments consists of million in common stocks and million in non sinking fund preferred stocks 
the common stock equity assets are typically valued for future economic prospects as perceived by the market 
the non sinking fund preferred stocks are typically valued using credit spreads to u 
s 
treasury benchmarks 
this causes them to be comparable to fixed income securities in terms of interest rate risk 
throughout  non sinking fund preferred stocks were not actively traded by the market  though lower interest rates intrinsically benefit their market values 
at december   the duration on the company s non sinking fund preferred stock portfolio was years 
this implies that an upward parallel shift in the yield curve by basis points would reduce the asset value at december  by approximately million  everything else remaining the same 
the common equity portfolio  representing approximately of total investments at market value  consists primarily of public utility common stocks 
these assets are theoretically defensive in nature and therefore have low volatility to changes in market price as measured by their beta 
beta is a measure of a security s systematic non diversifiable risk  which is the percentage change in an individual security s return for a change in the return of the market 
the average beta for the company s common stock holdings was 
based on a hypothetical reduction in the overall value of the stock market  the fair value of the common stock portfolio would decrease by approximately million 
effective january   the company entered into an interest rate swap of its fixed rate obligation on its million fixed rate senior notes for a floating rate 
the interest rate swap has the effect of hedging the fair value of the senior notes
