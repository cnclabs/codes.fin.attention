overview since its founding in  gateway has been a technology and direct marketing pioneer  using our call centers  web site and retail stores to build direct customer relationships 
as a branded integrator of personalized pc and consumer electronics products and services  we offer consumers  businesses  and government and educational institutions a wide range of plasma  lcd  and rear projection tvs  digital photo and video solutions  enterprise networking systems and services and other products which integrate with and complement our award winning line of pcs 
gateway faces a variety of challenges and opportunities inherent within the pc and consumer electronics industries which are characterized by rapid change  evolving customer demands and intense competition 
we manage our business along two operating segments consumer and professional 
our strengths revolve around our strong name recognition  our innovative product lines  unique business model and ability to maneuver quickly in the rapidly changing pc and consumer electronics industries 
key challenges we face include our ability to increase demand for gateway products  our ability to continue lowering costs as part of our branded integrator transformation announced in the second quarter of  managing our outsourced manufacturing supply  customer service and administrative relationships  anticipating changing customer demands  maintaining and growing pc market share reversing market share declines in both the consumer and professional segments in the face of intense competition  and continuing to grow our consumer electronics business at current or higher growth margin levels with increased competition from a number of business fronts 
during  we continued to experience a significant decline in demand for our pc products offset in part by a significant increase in demand for our higher margin consumer electronics products 
some of the key highlights from include branded integrator strategy during the second quarter of  we announced our new branded integrator strategy with plans to introduce new consumer electronics products in categories 
we ended the year having introduced new products and services in new categories  far exceeding targets set at introduction 
store remodels during the year  we refurbished stores and remodeled stores to create a high touch pc and consumer electronics buying experience that both displays our new line of ce non pc products and demonstrates the way they seamlessly work together 
however  by the end of  the stores had not met our expectations for increased sales 
product fulfillment model during the third quarter of we introduced our new product fulfillment model to transform the way we handle product sourcing  logistics and support services 
the model is 
table of contents based on using strategic partners and collaborative planning with suppliers and in house resources to make the company leaner  nimbler  and more responsive to our customers 
we also established three new regional distribution hubs which should enable us to reach of us customers and retail stores within days 
we experienced startup or transitional issues in the fourth quarter of related to our new fulfillment model that affected our customer delivery dates  product availability and volumes particularly on the media center pc  fmc family room media center pc and hd plasma tvs and customer satisfaction levels 
the fulfillment model is still evolving and we expect to have these issues resolved in the first half of growth in consumer electronics product demand throughout the year  we continued to experience strong demand for our higher margin consumer electronics offerings including digital cameras  tvs and other consumer electronics products 
ce non pc revenue rose to million in the fourth quarter and to million for the full year  up from million in sales of ce non pc products represented of net revenues for as compared with for restructuring and retail store closures during the first quarter of  we announced a million cost reduction program which included the closure of retail stores 
by year end  we achieved million in cost of goods sold reductions and million in sales  general and administrative cost savings in we exited with net sales of billion  an decline over net sales of billion 
a substantial portion of this decline was due to the closure of the retail stores  competitive pricing  our focus on growing our consumer electronics business  supply constraints and general market share loss 
gross margins for the year held steady at  evidence as to the effectiveness of our cost reduction strategies 
during  we recorded million  or approximately of net sales  of transformation and restructuring charges to cost of goods sold 
agreement to acquire emachines on january   we announced our agreement to acquire emachines for million shares of gateway common stock and approximately million in cash 
under the agreement  wayne inouye  emachines chief executive officer  will become the new chief executive officer of gateway and a member of gateway s board of directors 
theodore w 
waitt  gateway s founder  will remain chairman of the board and roderick m 
sherwood iii will remain gateway s executive vice president and chief financial officer 
this acquisition combines our branded integrator strategy  consumer electronics leadership  scale and cash availability with emachines low cost structure  pc market strength  and international presence 
we expect the combined company will create a strong player in the us pc market across multiple channels of distribution and across both the low end and higher end pc markets  with sales in key international markets  particularly in the united kingdom and japan 
we expect to evaluate re entry in other international markets 
the emachines transaction is subject to customary closing conditions  including expiration of a regulatory waiting period  and is expected to close by mid march outlook gateway s growth plans are focused on new ce non pc product and solution introductions  competitive low end pc offerings  our branded integrator strategy and related products  and networking products and services in the professional segment 
we expect that the pricing environment will continue to be challenging for  potentially resulting in further decreases in average product prices 

table of contents upon closing the emachines transaction  we plan to leverage emachines existing relationships in the retail channel to explore expanded distribution of gateway s consumer electronics products beyond our own channels 
with this multi channel approach  increased points of distribution and expanded product line  there is potential for enhanced growth across both our pc and consumer electronics businesses in the us and overseas  although restructuring actions could curtail this growth in additionally  we expect that as we integrate  we will gain significant operating leverage by adopting many elements of emachines efficient  low cost model to our operating structure and to combine the best practices from both companies to continue driving reductions in the costs of goods sold and sg a 
we expect that  together  the scaling of more profitable lines of business and continued costs reductions will drive substantial margin synergies and cost savings and return us to profitability in critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses gateway s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles and gateway s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations requires gateway s management to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k summarizes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of gateway s consolidated financial statements 
management believes the following to be critical accounting policies whose application has a material impact on gateway s financial presentation 
that is  they are both important to the portrayal of gateway s financial condition and results  and they require management to make judgments and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition gateway recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenue from the sale of products is recognized upon delivery of the products to customers 
revenue from services that are rendered by us  such as extended warranties  is recognized straight line over the service period  while training revenue is recognized as the services are provided 
other than internet services  revenue from the sale of services that are rendered by third parties such as installation services is generally recognized when delivered 
we offer our customers internet services which are provided by third parties 
the revenue associated with these services is recognized as the services are provided based on subscriber counts reported to us by the service providers 
if the actual subscriber counts or the economics associated with these subscriber counts prove to be more or less than originally reported by the service providers  we may be required to adjust revenue 
in the fourth quarter of  america online  inc aol unilaterally recomputed payments it had made in and the first half of and withheld the claimed overpayments from amounts currently owed to us 
we have disputed aol s retroactive adjustment to the mutually agreed and previously paid amounts and have commenced formal dispute resolution proceedings as required by our agreement 
gateway records reductions in revenue in the current period for estimated future product returns related to current period revenue 
management analyzes historical returns  current economic trends  changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products when evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns allowances in any accounting period 
if actual returns exceed estimated returns  we would be required to record additional reductions to revenue 
gateway records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to customer incentive programs  including customer rebates and other sales incentives  including  among other things  trade ins and referral 
table of contents credits 
future market conditions and product transitions may require us to increase customer incentive programs that could result in incremental reductions of revenue at the time such programs are offered 
additionally  certain incentive programs require management to estimate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of the particular incentive programs 
if a greater than estimated proportion of customers redeem such incentives  we would be required to record additional reductions to revenue which would affect earnings in the period the adjustments are made 
allowance for doubtful accounts gateway maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
the estimate is based on management s assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts and includes consideration of the credit worthiness and financial condition of those specific customers 
we record an allowance to reduce the specific receivables to the amount that is reasonably believed to be collectible 
we also record an allowance for all other trade receivables based on multiple factors including historical experience with bad debts  the general economic environment  the financial condition of our customers  and the aging of such receivables 
we do not expect default rates to be greater than of professional segment net sales 
if there is a deterioration of a major customer s financial condition or we become aware of additional information related to the credit worthiness of a major customer  or if future actual default rates on trade receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated  we may have to adjust our allowance for doubtful accounts  which would affect earnings in the period the adjustments are made 
gateway does not have a single customer that accounts for or more of our revenue or accounts receivable 
inventory valuation the business environment in which gateway operates is subject to rapid changes in technology and customer demand 
we record write downs for components and products which have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value 
we perform a detailed assessment of inventory by part each quarter  which includes a review of  among other factors  inventory on hand and forecast requirements  product life cycle including end of life product and development plans  component cost trends  product pricing and quality issues 
based on this analysis  we record an adjustment for excess and obsolete inventory 
gateway may be required to record additional write downs if actual demand  component costs or product life cycles differ from estimates which would affect earnings in the period the write downs are made 
warranty provision gateway provides standard warranties with the sale of products 
the estimated cost of providing the product warranty is recorded at the time revenue is recognized 
we maintain product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of suppliers 
we experienced a significant decline in our required warranty provision at the end of due to the shortening of our pc standard warranty periods and increased sales of consumer electronics products which typically have much shorter warranty periods  generally days 
estimated warranty costs are affected by ongoing product failure rates  specific product class failures outside of experience and material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure or in providing customer support 
if actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from the estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required and would affect earnings in the period the adjustments are made 
restructuring gateway has engaged and may continue to engage in restructuring actions which require our management to utilize significant estimates related to realizable values of assets made redundant or obsolete  expenses for severance and other employee separation costs  lease cancellation and other exit costs and estimates of future rental income that may be generated through the subleasing of excess facilities 
should the actual amounts differ from our estimates  the amount of the restructuring charges could be materially impacted 
for a full description of our restructuring actions  refer to our discussion of restructuring charges in the results of operations section 

table of contents taxes on earnings gateway records a tax provision benefit for the anticipated tax consequences of our reported results of operations 
the provision for benefit from income taxes is computed using the liability method  under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider our ability to carryback losses  forecasted earnings and future taxable income and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for and amount of a valuation allowance 
as of december   our valuation allowance was million and our net deferred tax asset had been reduced to if we determine that it is more likely than not that our net deferred tax assets will be realized  our valuation allowance would be reversed  resulting in a positive adjustment to earnings in the period such determination is made 
litigation gateway is currently involved in certain legal proceedings 
when a loss is considered probable in connection with litigation or governmental proceedings and the loss amount can be reasonably estimated within a range  we record the minimum estimated liability related to the claim if there is no best estimate in the range 
as additional information becomes available  we assess the potential liability related to the legal proceedings and revise those estimates 
revisions in estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operations in the period of adjustment
