item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview adtran  inc designs  develops  manufactures  markets  and services a broad range of high speed network access products utilized by providers of telecommunications services and enterprise end users 
we currently sell our products to a large number of service providers  including all regional bell operating companies rbocs  and to private and public enterprises worldwide 
sales increased this year compared to last year due to our strategy of increasing unit volume and market share through the introduction of new products and succeeding generations of products having lower selling prices and increased functionality as compared to both the prior generation of a product and to the products of competitors 
an important part of our strategy is to reduce the cost of each succeeding product generation and then to lower the product s selling price based on the cost savings achieved 
as a part of this strategy  we seek in most instances to be a high quality  low cost provider of products in our markets 
our success to date is attributable in large measure to our ability to design our products initially with a view to their subsequent redesign  allowing both increased functionality and reduced manufacturing costs in each succeeding product generation 
this strategy enables us to sell succeeding generations of products to existing customers  while increasing our market share by selling these enhanced products to new customers 
the year over year increase in our systems revenue is primarily attributable to increasing sales of new products comprised of digital subscriber line access multiplexers dslams  optical access products  and netvanta products 
our dslams  consolidate broadband traffic together in one place  and provides the technology that allows phone companies to compete with cable companies in the high speed internet service market 
the year over year decrease in high bit rate digital subscriber line hdsl t revenue is primarily attributable to declining enterprise networks sales of channel service units data service units csu dsu products  partially offset by increasing carrier networks sales of hdsl based total access broadband platform products 
the industry has integrated the functionality of csu dsus into access routers  thereby reducing the requirement for a standalone csu dsu 
the increase in hdsl revenue is the result of migration from non intelligent legacy hardware to intelligent remote monitoring access hardware  and a result of market share gains 
the year over year decrease in digital business transport dbt total reach sales is the result of newer and higher speed technologies replacing the lower speed technology of isdn and dds products 
our overall market share in dbt total reach has been maintained and we continue to take advantage of market opportunities for these products where speed is not the main consideration 
however  dbt total reach is a declining market  which is being cannibalized by higher speed dsl technology 
during the latter half of  our results reflected what we believe to be an improving enterprise spending environment 
we have seen indications of increasing activity levels across our customer base and across our product categories 
on a sequential quarterly basis  hdsl t revenues increased from the third to the fourth quarter of this increase is primarily attributable to an increase in enterprise spending  market share gains  and t line growth 
on october   the board of directors declared  effective december   a two for one stock split to be effected in the form of a stock dividend of one share of common stock for each outstanding share of common stock for stockholders of record on december  share and per share amounts  including stock options  in the accompanying consolidated statements of income and notes to consolidated financial statements have been retroactively adjusted to reflect our stock split 
our operating results have fluctuated on a quarterly basis in the past  and operating results may vary significantly in future periods due to a number of factors 
we normally operate with very little order backlog 
the majority of our sales in each quarter result from orders booked in that quarter and firm purchase orders released in that quarter by customers under agreements containing non binding purchase commitments 
furthermore  many of our customers require prompt delivery of products 
this results in a limited backlog of orders for these products and requires us to maintain sufficient inventory levels to satisfy anticipated customer demand 
if near term demand for our products declines  or if potential sales in any quarter do not occur as anticipated  our financial results could be adversely affected 
operating expenses are relatively fixed in the short term  therefore  a shortfall in quarterly revenues could significantly impact our financial results in a given quarter 
further  maintaining sufficient inventory levels to assure prompt delivery of our products increases the amount of inventory which may become obsolete and increases the risk that the obsolescence of such inventory may have an adverse effect on our business and operating results 

table of contents our operating results may also fluctuate as a result of a number of other factors  including increased competition  customer order patterns  changes in product mix  timing differences between price decreases and product cost reductions  product warranty returns  and announcements of new products by us or our competitors 
accordingly  our historical financial performance is not necessarily a meaningful indicator of future results  and  in general  management expects that our financial results may vary from period to period 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
these policies have been consistently applied across our two reportable segments carrier networks division and enterprise networks division 
we review customer contracts to determine if all of the requirements for revenue recognition have been met prior to recording revenues from sales transactions 
we generally record sales revenue upon shipment of our products  net of any discounts  since i we generally do not have significant post delivery obligations  ii the product price is fixed and determinable  iii collection of the resulting receivable is probable  and iv product returns are reasonably estimable 
we generally ship products upon receipt of a purchase order from a customer 
we evaluate shipping terms and we record revenue on products shipped in accordance with the applicable terms of each respective contract 
we participate in cooperative advertising and market development programs with certain customers 
we use these programs to reimburse customers for certain forms of advertising  and in general  to allow our customers credits up to a specified percentage of their net purchases 
our costs associated with these programs are estimated and accrued at the time of sale and are included in marketing expenses in our consolidated statements of income 
we also participate in rebate programs to provide sales incentives for certain products 
our costs associated with these programs are estimated and accrued at the time of sale  and are recorded as a reduction of sales in our consolidated statements of income 
sales returns are accrued based on historical sales return experience  which we believe provides a reasonable estimate of future returns 
product returns are generally only permitted by customers who purchase our products under specific sales agreements that govern their rights of return 
prior to accepting a new customer  we perform a detailed credit review of the customer 
credit limits are established for each new customer based on the results of this credit review 
payment terms are established for each new customer  and collection experience is reviewed periodically in order to determine if the customer s payment terms and credit limits need to be revised 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial conditions of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  we may be required to make additional allowances 
if circumstances change with regard to individual receivable balances that had previously been determined to be uncollectible and for which a specific reserve had been established  a reduction in our allowance for doubtful accounts may be required 
our allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million at december  and  respectively 
we recorded  million and million of bad debt expense during the years ended december   and  respectively 
in addition  improving financial conditions in the telecom industry allowed us to reduce our allowance for doubtful accounts by million 
we carry our inventory at the lower of cost or market  with cost being determined using the first in  first out method 
we use standard costs for material  labor  and manufacturing overhead to value our inventory 
our standard costs are updated on a monthly basis and any variances are expensed in the current period 
therefore  our inventory costs approximate actual costs at the end of each reporting period 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory by an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  we may be required to make additional inventory write downs 
our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory was million and million at december  and  respectively 
inventory write downs charged to the reserve were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the objective of our short term investment policy is to preserve principal and maintain adequate liquidity with appropriate diversification  while emphasizing market returns on our monetary assets 
the objective of our long term investment policy is to emphasize total return  that is  the aggregate return from capital appreciation  dividend income  and interest income 
this is achieved through investments with appropriate diversification in fixed and variable rate income  public equity  and private equity portfolios 
during  we changed our fixed income investment policy  shortening the maximum maturity from years to five and one half years  with consistent dollar maturities  year to year 
we have experienced significant volatility in the market prices of our publicly traded equity investments 
these investments are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of tax 
the ultimate realized value on these equity investments is subject to market price volatility until they are sold 

table of contents we review our investment portfolio for potential other than temporary declines in value on an individual investment basis 
we assess  on a quarterly basis  significant declines in value which may be considered other than temporary and  if necessary  recognize and record the appropriate charge to write down the carrying value of such investments 
in making this assessment  we take into consideration a wide range of objective and subjective information  including but not limited to the following the magnitude and duration of historical decline in market prices  credit rating activity  assessments of liquidity  public filings  and statements made by the issuer 
we generally begin our identification of potential other than temporary impairments by reviewing any security with a market value that has declined from its original or adjusted cost basis by for more than six months 
we then evaluate the individual security based on the previously identified factors to determine the amount of the write down  if any 
actual losses  if any  could ultimately differ from these estimates 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in additional losses that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
for  and  we recorded other than temporary write downs of our marketable equity investments of  million and  respectively 
these write downs are included in net realized investment gains losses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
we also invest in privately held entities and record our investments in these entities at cost 
we review our investments in these entities periodically in order to determine if circumstances both financial and non financial exist that indicate that we will not recover our initial investment 
impairment charges are recorded on investments having a cost basis that is greater than the value that we would reasonably expect to receive in an arm s length sale of the investment 
for  and  we recorded write downs of our cost basis investments of  million and million  respectively 
these write downs are included in net realized investment gains losses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
we estimate our income tax provision or benefit in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate  including estimating exposures related to examinations by taxing authorities 
we must also make judgements regarding the realization of deferred tax assets 
the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets is based on our belief that it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient future taxable income in certain jurisdictions to realize these deferred tax assets 
a valuation allowance has been established for deferred tax assets which we do not believe meet the more likely than not criteria established by sfas no 
accounting for income taxes 
our estimates regarding future taxable income and income tax provision or benefit may vary due to changes in market conditions  changes in tax laws  or other factors 
if our assumptions  and consequently our estimates  change in the future  the valuation allowances we have established may be increased or decreased  impacting future income tax expense 
we estimate our cost to repair or replace defective products at the time revenue is recognized and include this cost in cost of goods sold in our consolidated statement of income 
our products generally include warranties of one to years for product defects 
the liability for warranty returns totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
these liabilities are included in accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
our estimates regarding future warranty obligations may change due to product failure rates  shipment volumes  and other rework costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
if our estimates change in the future  the liability for warranty returns we have established may be increased or decreased  impacting future cost of goods sold expense

table of contents compared to sales adtran s sales increased from million in to million in the increase is primarily the result of increasing unit volume and market share gains in the carrier networks division 
in particular  the increase in overall sales is attributable to an increase in sales of our systems products  partially offset by decreased sales of our digital business transport dbt total reach and high bit rate digital subscriber line hdsl t products 
the increase in systems revenue is attributable to sales of new products comprised of dslams  optical access and netvanta products 
the decrease in hdsl t revenue is primarily attributable to a decrease in enterprise networks division sales of t csu dsu products  partially offset by an increase in carrier networks division sales of hdsl products 
carrier networks sales increased from million in to million in carrier networks sales  as a percentage of total sales  increased from in to in the increase in carrier networks sales is primarily attributable to an increase in sales of dslams  optical access  and hdsl based total access broadband platforms 
enterprise networks sales increased from million in to million in the increase in enterprise networks sales is primarily related to an increase in sales of total access integrated access devices and netvanta products  partially offset by a decrease in csu dsu sales  which is a hardware unit that terminates carrier services at the enterprise location 
the industry has integrated the functionality of csu dsus into access routers  thereby reducing the requirement for a standalone csu dsu 
enterprise networks sales  as a percentage of total sales  decreased from in to in foreign sales decreased from million in to million in the decrease in foreign sales is attributable to market challenges in the european and asia pacific regions 
we are still in the process of developing business relationships and expanding our sales base in these regions 
cost of sales cost of sales  as a percentage of sales  decreased from in to in the decrease is primarily related to manufacturing efficiencies  the timing differences between the recognition of cost reductions and the lowering of product selling prices  and the sales of higher margin new products 
in addition  the decrease resulted from improvements in supply chain management  due to the implementation of an advanced planning system and a web based procurement process  which has reduced cycle times and increased our manufacturing flexibility 
we anticipate continued deployment of supply chain applications augmented with process improvement strategies will result in further cost reductions  which we believe will provide a continued competitive advantage 
carrier networks cost of sales  as a percent of division sales  decreased from in to in enterprise networks cost of sales  as a percent of division sales  decreased from in to in an important part of our strategy is to reduce the product cost of each succeeding product generation and then to lower the product s price based on the cost savings achieved 
this strategy  as described above  sometimes results in variations in our gross profit margin due to timing differences between the recognition of cost reductions and the lowering of product selling prices 
in view of the rapid pace of new product introductions by our company  this strategy may result in variations in gross profit margins that  for any particular financial period  can be difficult to predict 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased from million in to million in this increase is primarily related to an increase in sales and the rescission in september of salary reductions implemented in the second half of as a cost control mechanism  instead of extensive staff reductions generally imposed throughout the telecommunications industry 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses is partially offset by million of bad debt expense that was recorded in  compared to of bad debt expense that was recorded in in addition  improving financial conditions in the telecom industry allowed us to reduce our allowance for doubtful accounts by million in the latter half of selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales decreased from in to in selling  general and administrative expenses include personnel costs for administration  finance  information systems  human resources  sales and marketing and general management  as well as rent  utilities  legal and accounting expenses  bad debts  advertising  promotional

research and development expenses as a percentage of sales will fluctuate whenever there is a significant fluctuation in revenues during the periods being compared 
we continually evaluate new product opportunities and engage in intensive research and product development efforts 
we frequently invest heavily in up front new product development efforts prior to the actual commencement of sales of a major new product 
to date  we have expensed all product research and development costs as incurred 
as a result  we may incur significant research and development expenses prior to the receipt of revenues from a major new product group 
we are presently incurring research and development expenses in connection with new products and expansion into international markets 
in today s challenging industry environment  we have maintained our level of investment in research and development during a period when many competitors have significantly reduced their investments in this area 
this investment has provided for continued new product development  enhancement of current products  and product cost reductions 
interest and dividend income interest and dividend income decreased from million in to million in this decrease is primarily related to lower interest rates and shorter maturities on our fixed income investments  partially offset by an increase in interest producing assets 
interest expense interest expense on our taxable revenue bond decreased slightly from million in to million in see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on our revenue bond 
net realized investment gain loss net realized investment gain loss changed from a net loss of million in to a net gain of million in this change is primarily related to an impairment charge for other than temporary declines in the market value of investments that was recognized in the second and third quarters of  compared to transactional based gains and losses realized in we assess  on a quarterly basis  significant declines in investment value which may be considered other than temporary and  if necessary  recognize and record the appropriate charge to write down the carrying value of such investments 
accordingly  during  we recorded million of other than temporary investment impairment charges related to marketable equity securities investments 
the remaining million of net realized investment loss was related to write downs of private securities and realized transactional gains and losses in other income expense other income increased from million in to million in this increase is primarily related to net recoveries from former customers  realized foreign currency gains and scrap material sales 
income taxes our effective tax rate increased from in to in this increase is primarily related to a higher mix of taxable income  and lower research and development tax credits as a percent of taxable income  partially offset by the settlement of tax contingencies during during the year ended december   we resolved certain tax contingencies resulting in the reduction of our effective tax rate from to 

table of contents net income as a result of the above factors  net income increased from million in to million in as a percentage of sales  net income increased from in to in compared to sales adtran s sales decreased from million in to million in the decrease was primarily the result of decreased spending by our customers  which we believe to be a result of both economic and industry wide factors

other income expense other income expense increased from an expense of million in to income of million in this increase is primarily related to an increase in realized foreign currency gains and scrap material sales 
net realized investment losses net realized investment losses increased from million in to million in this increase is primarily related to an impairment charge for other than temporary declines in the market value of investments 
we recorded an impairment charge of million of other than temporary investment impairment charges related to marketable equity security investments 
the remaining million of net realized investment loss was related to write downs of private securities and realized transactional gains and losses in income taxes our effective tax rate decreased from in to in pre tax income for financial reporting purposes was substantially lower through due to the other than temporary declines in the market value of certain investments 
the higher mix of non taxable income  and higher research and development tax credits and economic incentive credits as a percent of taxable income resulted in a substantially lower effective tax rate 
net income as a result of the above factors  net income increased from million in to million in as a percentage of sales  net income increased from in to in liquidity and capital resources fifty million dollars of the expansion of phase iii of our corporate headquarters was approved for participation in an incentive program offered by the alabama state industrial development authority the authority 
the incentive program enables participating companies to generate alabama corporate income tax credits that can be used to reduce the amount of alabama corporate income taxes that would otherwise be payable 
we cannot be certain that the state of alabama will continue to make these corporate income tax credits available in the future  and therefore  we may not realize the full benefit of these incentives 
through december   the authority had issued million of its taxable revenue bonds pursuant to the incentive program and loaned the proceeds from the sale of the bonds to adtran

in july  the board of directors determined to begin declaring quarterly dividends on our common stock  and presently anticipates that it will declare a regular quarterly dividend so long as the present tax treatment of dividends exists and adequate levels of liquidity 
table of contents are maintained 
on july   the board declared a special and quarterly cash dividend of and per common share  respectively  to be paid to stockholders of record at the close of business on july  the special and quarterly dividend payment  which was paid on august   totaled million 
on october   the board declared a second quarterly cash dividend of per common share to be paid to stockholders of record at the close of business on october  the quarterly dividend payment was approximately million and was paid on november  the board declared a third quarterly cash dividend on january  the quarterly cash dividend was per common share to be paid to holders of record at the close of business on february   with a payment date of february  the quarterly dividend payment was approximately million 
on october   we announced that our board of directors declared  effective december   a two for one stock split to be effected in the form of a stock dividend of one share of common stock for each outstanding share of common stock for stockholders of record on december  share and per share amounts  including stock options  in the accompanying consolidated statements of income and notes to consolidated financial statements have been retroactively adjusted to reflect our stock split 
our working capital  which consists of current assets less current liabilities  increased from million as of december  to million as of december  the quick ratio  defined as cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  and net accounts receivable  divided by current liabilities  decreased from as of december  to as of december  the current ratio  defined as current assets divided by current liabilities  decreased from as of december  to as of december  the decrease in liquidity ratios is primarily a result of the special and quarterly dividend payments and a movement of monetary assets from cash and cash equivalents to long term investments  partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable 
as of december   we had an income tax receivable of million 
this receivable was generated in the fourth quarter of from the tax benefit associated with the exercise of non qualified stock options 
we receive an income tax deduction for the difference between the exercise price and the market price of a non qualified stock option upon exercise by the employee 
we recorded million during the year ended as an income tax deduction for the difference between the exercise price and the market price of non qualified stock option exercises 
at december   our cash on hand of million and short term investments of million placed our short term liquidity in cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments at million 
at december   cash on hand was million and short term investments were million  which placed our short term liquidity at million 
this decrease is primarily attributable to the million of special and quarterly dividend payments and a movement of monetary assets from cash and cash equivalents to long term investments  partially offset by our ability to generate cash from operations and proceeds received from the exercise of employee stock options 
at december   our long term investments increased by to million from million at december  this increase is primarily attributable to our ability to generate cash from operations  the investment of proceeds from stock option exercises  and increases in market value of long term available for sale securities 
the decrease in deferred tax assets and the increase in deferred tax liabilities is attributable to the increase in market value of our long term investments 
long term investments at december   and december   include a restricted balance of million related to our revenue bonds  as discussed above 
we intend to finance our operations in the future with cash flow from operations and our remaining borrowed taxable revenue bond proceeds 
we believe these available sources of funds to be adequate to meet our operating and capital needs for the foreseeable future 
accounts receivable increased from december  to december  quarterly accounts receivable days sales outstanding increased one day from days as of december  to days as of december  this increase in accounts receivable is caused by increased sales 
other receivables increased from december  to december   primarily resulting from an increase in shipments of components to subcontractors  due to an increase in business activity 
even with a increase in sales  inventory remained relatively stable from december  to december  quarterly inventory turnover increased from turns as of december  to turns as of december  the increase in inventory turnover is attributable to our continued efforts to streamline our production process  work closely and efficiently with our subcontractors  and increase manufacturing velocity 
in addition  improvements in supply chain management due to the implementation of an advanced planning system and a web based procurement process have reduced cycle times and increased our manufacturing flexibility 
the deployment of these supply chain applications and initiatives has resulted in better inventory control and increased inventory turnover 
accounts payable increased from december  to december  accrued expenses increased from december  to december  these increases are primarily related to the variations of timing of payments  increased business activity  and a net increase in our warranty reserve related to the expanding base of adtran products in the field under warranty 
capital expenditures totaled approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
these expenditures were primarily used to purchase computer hardware and software  manufacturing and test equipment  and in to expand our corporate headquarters 

table of contents in july  the board of directors approved the repurchase of  shares of adtran common stock on a pre split basis 
as of december   we had repurchased  shares of our common stock on a pre split basis  shares post split at a total cost of million and had the authority to purchase an additional  shares 
no shares were purchased during the year ended december  we issued  shares of treasury stock and  newly issued shares of common stock for million during the year ended december   to accommodate employee stock option exercises 
during and  we issued  and  shares of treasury stock  respectively  to accommodate employee stock option exercises 
we have used  and expect to continue to use  the cash generated from operations for working capital  dividend payments  and other general corporate purposes  including i product development activities to enhance our existing products and develop new products and ii expansion of sales and marketing activities 
we have various contractual obligations and commercial commitments 
the following table sets forth  in millions  the annual payments  exclusive of interest payments  we are required to make under contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments at december  contractual obligations in millions total after long term debt investment commitments operating lease obligations purchase obligations totals we do not have off balance sheet financing arrangements and have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of or requirements for capital resources
