item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview prior to our acquisition of oak technology  inc in august  our products consisted of integrated circuits and related products used primarily in digital versatile disc players  or dvds  dvd recorders  movie and home theater systems  digital cameras and video editing systems 
as a result of the acquisition of oak  we also provide integrated circuits  software and platforms for digital television applications that enable the delivery and display of digital video content through a set top box or television as well as digital imaging products consisting of semiconductor hardware and software that enable users to print  scan  process and transmit documents to computer peripherals that perform printing functions 
we derive most of our revenues from the sale of our integrated circuit products 
historically  average selling prices in the semiconductor industry in general  and for our products in particular  have decreased over the life of a particular product 
average selling prices for our hardware products have fluctuated substantially from period to period  primarily as a result of changes in our customer mix of original equipment manufacturer  or oem  sales versus sales to resellers and the transition from low volume to high volume production 
in the past  we have periodically reduced the prices of some of our products in order to better penetrate the consumer market 
we believe that  as our product lines continue to mature and competitive markets evolve  we are likely to experience further declines in the average selling prices of our products  although we cannot predict the timing and amount of such future changes with any certainty 
our cost of product revenues consist primarily of fabrication costs  assembly and test costs  and the cost of materials and overhead from operations 
if we are unable to reduce our cost of product revenues to offset anticipated decreases in average selling prices  our product gross margins will decrease 
our product gross margin is also dependent on product mix and on the percentage of products sold directly to our oem customers versus indirectly through our marketing and distribution partners who purchase our products at lower prices but absorb most of the associated marketing and sales support expenses  maintain inventories and provide customer support and training 
our nine resellers including fujifilm collectively accounted for of total revenues in lower gross margins on sales to resellers are partially offset by reduced selling and marketing expenses related to such sales 
product sales in japan are primarily made through fujifilm  our strategic partner and reseller in japan 
fujifilm provides more sales and marketing support than our other resellers 
we expect both product and customer mix to continue to fluctuate in future periods  causing further fluctuations in margins 
we also derive revenue from licensing our software and other intellectual property 
licensing revenue includes one time license fees and royalties based on the number of units distributed by the licensee 
in addition  we have historically generated a percentage of our total revenues from development contracts  primarily with key customers 
however  development revenue has declined substantially as a percentage of total revenues over the past several years 
our key customers have periodically provided us with partial funding for the development of some of our products 
these development contracts provide for license and milestone payments which are recorded as development revenue 
we classify all development costs  including costs related to these development contracts  as research and development expenses 
we retain ownership of the intellectual property developed by us under these development contracts 
while we intend to continue to enter into development contracts with certain strategic partners  we expect development revenue to continue to decline as a percentage of total revenues 
our research and development expenses consist of salaries and related costs of employees engaged in research  design and development activities and costs of engineering materials and supplies 
we are also a party to research and development agreements with the chief scientist in israel s ministry of industry and trade and the israel united states binational industrial research and development foundation  which fund up to of incurred project costs for approved products up to specified contract maximums 
these agreements require us to use our best efforts to achieve specified results 
in some cases  to the extent it is practicable  we are required to manufacture a portion of the manufacturing volume in israel 
the grants also require us to pay royalties at rates of to of resulting product sales  and up to of resulting license revenues  up to a maximum of to of the total funding received 
reported research and development expenses are net of these grants  which fluctuate from period to period 
we believe that significant investments in research and development are required for us to remain competitive  and we expect to continue to devote significant resources to product development  although such expenses as a percentage of total revenues may fluctuate 
our selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee related expenses  royalties  sales commissions  product promotion and other professional services 
we expect that selling  general and administrative expenses will continue to increase to support our anticipated growth 
we conduct a material amount of our research and development and certain sales and marketing and administrative operations in israel through our wholly owned israeli subsidiary 
as a result  some of our expenses are incurred in new israeli shekels 
to date  substantially all of our product sales and our development and licensing revenue have been denominated in us dollars and most costs of product sales have been incurred in us dollars 
we expect that most of our sales and costs of sales will continue to be denominated and incurred in us dollars for the foreseeable future 
we have not experienced material losses or gains as a result of currency exchange rate fluctuations and have not engaged in hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to such fluctuations 
we may in the future elect to take action to reduce our foreign exchange risk 
our effective income tax rate has benefited from the availability of net operating losses which we have utilized to reduce taxable income for us federal income tax purposes and by our israeli subsidiary s status as an approved enterprise under israeli law  which provides a ten year tax holiday for income attributable to a portion of our operations in israel 
our us federal net operating losses expire at various times between and  and the benefits from our subsidiary s approved enterprise status expire at various times beginning in on may   we effected a three for two split of our common stock in the form of a fifty percent stock dividend  paid to stockholders of record on may  all share and per share information for all periods presented in this report are on a post split basis 
statement regarding use of non gaap financial measures in addition to reporting financial results in accordance with generally accepted principles  or gaap  we include non gaap financial results in our earnings press releases and presentations to investors 
our non gaap net income and earnings per share presentations generally exclude acquisition related charges  such as acquired in process research and development and amortization of goodwill and other intangibles  and certain other charges that are non recurring and in management s view not indicative of ongoing operating cash flows  as well as the tax effects of these items 
our management believes these non gaap measures are useful to investors because they provide supplemental information that facilitates comparisons to prior periods 
management uses these non gaap measures to evaluate its financial results  develop budgets and manage expenditures 
these non gaap measures may differ from the non gaap measures used by other companies and should not be regarded as a replacement for corresponding gaap measures 
recent developments on august   we completed our acquisition of oak technology  inc  or oak  through a merger with a wholly owned subsidiary of zoran 
the acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
following the completion of the acquisition  the results of operations of oak have been included in our consolidated financial statements 
accordingly  our results of operations for the year ended december  reflect oak s operations since august   while our results of operations for the year ended december  and reflect only zoran s historical operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including bad debt  inventories  investments  intangible assets and income taxes 
we base these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements we generally recognize product sales to distributors at the time of delivery 
however  in some cases we grant rights of return or provide price protection arrangements 
when we are able to estimate the effect of such an arrangement  we establish a reserve for the estimated adjustment and recognize the balance of the product revenue associated with that arrangement upon shipment 
when we cannot reasonably estimate the effect of such an arrangement  we defer all revenue subject to the arrangement until the return right has lapsed or the price has become fixed 
revenue from development contracts is generally recognized as the services are performed based on the specific deliverables outlined in each contract 
amounts received in advance of performance under contracts are recorded as deferred revenue and are generally recognized within one year from receipt 
costs associated with development revenues are included primarily in research and development expenses 
inventories are recorded at the lower of standard cost  which approximates actual cost on a first in first out basis  or market value 
we write down inventories to net realizable value based on forecasted demand and market conditions 
actual demand and market conditions may be different from those projected by our management 
this could have a material effect on our operating results and financial position 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of certain of our customers to make required payments 
these allowances are estimated based on both specific identification and facts and circumstances with respect to each doubtful account as well as general allowances estimated based on historical patterns of billing corrections  returned material authorizations and time lags in the realization of doubtful accounts and bad debts 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we hold minority interests in private companies having operations or technology in areas within our strategic focus 
at december   these investments totaled million 
we record an investment impairment charge when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value 
we assess the value of this investment principally by using information acquired from the investee  including historical and projected financial performance and recent funding events 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
in  we recorded non cash investment impairment charges of million in conjunction with investments in private companies 
we assess the impairment of goodwill annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets exceeds their fair value 
we assess the carrying value of our long lived assets if events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of the assets exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows attributable to such assets 
with respect to both goodwill and long lived assets  factors  which could trigger an impairment review  include significant negative industry or economic trends  exiting an activity in conjunction with a restructuring of operations  current  historical or projected losses that demonstrate continuing losses associated with an asset or a significant decline in our market capitalization for an extended period of time  relative to net book value 
impairment evaluations involve management estimates of asset useful lives and future cash flows 
these estimates include assumptions about future conditions such as future revenues  gross margins  operating expenses  the fair values of certain assets based on appraisals  and industry trends 
actual useful lives and cash flows could be different from those estimated by our management 
this could have a material effect on our operating results and financial position 
we follow the liability method of accounting for income taxes which requires recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequence of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
in the event actual results differ from these expectations  then the resulting impact to income would be assessed in the period such determination was made 
if it becomes likely that some portion  or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized  a valuation allowance is established 
this determination includes a process for providing estimates for future taxable income  and requires the use of significant judgment 
any future release or adjustment to the valuation allowance is only made based upon a change in circumstances that triggers a change in judgment  about the realizability  with reasonable assurance  of the related deferred tax asset in future years 
with respect to  mergers and acquisitions we assess the technological feasibility of in process research and development projects and determine the number of alternative future uses for the technology being developed 
to the extent there are no alternative future uses we allocate a portion of the purchase price to in process r d 
this expense is generally estimated based upon the projected fair value of the technology  as determined by a discounted future cash flow reduced by the cost to complete 
this includes certain estimates and assumptions made by management 
for larger acquisitions  the company has historically hired an external appraiser to assist with the assumptions and models used in this type of analysis

total revenues grew by year over year 
revenue from our dtv and imaging business segments acquired from oak represented approximately million  or of total revenues  in we currently expect that a full year contribution by these segments will account for to of total revenues in the oak acquisition provided us with a substantially more diversified revenue base 
in  dvd product revenues comprised million or of our total revenues  whereas in the fourth quarter of  dvd product revenues represented million or of total revenues 
similarly  digital camera product revenues represented of revenues  whereas in the fourth quarter of digital camera revenues were million or of total revenues 
excluding the effect of the oak acquisition  total revenues grew by 
this increase was driven primarily by growth in dvd product revenues which were million  or of total revenues  for this represented a year over year increase of 
dvd revenue growth was primarily attributable to revenues from our vaddis product which started ramping into production volume in the first quarter of and had grown to of the dvd product mix by the fourth quarter 
digital camera revenues which were million  or of total revenues  in grew by million or  primarily as a result of the continued success of the coach and products 
revenues from licensing  development and other revenues represent million  or of total revenues in  compared to million  or of total revenues  in part of this growth was generated by software revenues of million and ip licensing revenue of million related to the oak acquisition 
the remaining million represented growth of approximately which was attributable to a higher level of ip licensing of zoran patented core technology for television video processing 
software and development revenues are reported at gross margins as any costs associated with these revenue streams have alternative uses and are therefore recorded in research and development expense 
approximately of our total revenues continue to be generated in asia with the balance coming from the americas and europe 
in the far east  china s share of total revenues increased by  from to  while japan s share declined by  from to 
in large part  this decline is a function of japanese customers shifting their manufacturing to less expensive subcontractors in china which is common in the consumer electronics industry 
in addition  the relative decline in revenues from japan was influenced by a relative increase in korea s share of revenues from to 
revenues from taiwan were consistent with the previous year at of total revenues and revenues from the rest of world grew by  from to  due to increased sales in germany and turkey 
post acquisition  we expect the proportional share of the rest of world revenues will increase by approximately due to the imaging business in the united states as well as slight increases in business in japan 
these slight increases are expected to come from the imaging and high definition television businesses 
geographic mix fluctuates somewhat throughout the year depending on the business cycle of the various markets associated with each line of business 
product gross margin 
on the whole  blended product gross margins declined in by approximately from to 
this decline was the result of erosion of the average selling prices  or asps  of our dvd products  partially offset by margin expansion in our digital camera product line and the addition of the oak business lines for part of the year 
despite a growth in year over year revenues  our dvd product gross margins  both in aggregate dollars and as a percentage of revenues  declined by approximately 
we shipped more than million dvd decoders which represented significant unit growth 
however  the decline in dvd gross margins was driven primarily by asp erosion which has been a distinguishing characteristic of this very competitive market over the last several years 
the decline in asps was partially offset by cost reductions  as well as greater dollar content per unit shipped via new products with higher prices based on additional integrated features 
due to the introduction of five new or improved products in  we currently expect that gross margins will improve during the year 
some of these new products have lower costs and better margins  and others have new features like mpeg compatibility or hdmi scalar connectivity 
within the dvd segment  we expect gross margins in the mid to high range 
in addition  we will be ramping into production with new dvd recorder products throughout the year which generally carry higher gross margins  in the mid range 
as these new products represent an increasingly larger percentage of the dvd product mix  we expect blended dvd gross margins to increase 
although gross margins for our digital camera products were dampened somewhat  the segment still experienced an improvement in gross margins as a percentage of revenue over the past year by approximately percentage points 
this was due in part to the relative mix of digital camera as opposed to cmos sensor business 
within the digital camera segment we currently expect gross margins to be in the historical range of mid s to low s in we believe that the product gross margins of the imaging and dtv businesses acquired from oak will add to the overall blended product gross margin producing a company wide product gross margin consistent with our historical mid to high range 
we currently believe that total product gross margins will improve throughout  due to the introduction of new products in the dvd business as well as expansion of other higher gross margin products like imaging  digital cameras and dvd recorders 
research and development 
research and development r d expenses increased to million in from million in this increase was driven almost entirely by the merger with oak including it s investment in the emerging dtv business 
with only of this net increase related to the legacy zoran business  legacy r d spending remained relatively flat in terms of absolute spending 
actual increases in r d expenses were offset in part by million of research grants received from the chief scientist in israel which is recorded as an offset to r d expense 
these grants are provided by the israeli government to fund specific r d projects 
the company is not obligated to repay the grants  however  future royalties may be owed to the government if the r d activities result in commercial product sales 
the company expects that r d spending in will approximately double due primarily to the acquisition of oak and some additional hiring through the course of the year 
as a percentage of revenues  r d is expected to decline throughout the year as revenues are anticipated to grow at a faster rate 
we remain committed to enhancing our technology and development capabilities 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased to million in from million in about of this increase was due to the acquisition of oak  and about was due to increases in our customer and application support in the asia pacific region during a portion of the oak spending was the result of non recurring acquisition related expense of million related to previous acquisition obligations of oak assumed by zoran 
in general  these commitments were made to ensure the proper transfer of employee knowledge and intellectual property during the integration of the companies 
as these charges are not part of our normal operating compensation practices  they are highlighted here as nonrecurring 
absent the oak acquisition  the sg a spending level of the legacy zoran business was consistent at approximately of total revenues which was in line with the revenue growth 
amortization of intangible assets 
amortization of intangible assets increased from million in to million in the amortization in related to intangible assets related to zoran s acquisition of nogatech and pixelcam in the increase during is due to the amortization of intangible assets acquired from oak 
deferred stock compensation 
these amounts were recorded primarily as a result of the oak acquisition and arise due to a remeasurement of the intrinsic value of the assumed outstanding options of the target company at the date of the acquisition in accordance with purchase accounting and consistent with the multi option method described in fasb interpretation the fair value of the unvested options is then capitalized and amortized as deferred stock compensation expense over the remaining respective vesting periods 
this deferred stock compensation will continue to be amortized at a rate of million in  million in and million in in process research and development 
approximately million of the purchase price of oak was allocated to in process research and development for five r d projects in various product divisions which had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
accordingly  this amount was immediately expensed upon the acquisition date 
this amount was determined using management s estimates including consultation with an independent appraiser 
the value of in process research and development was determined using the multi period excess earnings method by estimating the expected net cash flows from the projects once commercially viable and discounting the net cash flows back to their present value using a discount rate of 
this rate was based on the industry segment for the technology  nature of the products to be developed  length of time to complete the project and overall maturity and history of the development team 
the net cash flows from the identified projects were based on estimates of revenue  cost of revenue  research and development expenses  selling general and administrative expenses  and applicable income taxes 
these estimates did not take into account any potential synergies that could be realized as a result of the acquisition 
revenues for the incremental core technologies developed are expected to commence in the fourth quarter of and extend through revenue projections were based on estimates of market size and growth  expected trends in technology and the expected timing of new product introductions 
we expect that the in process technologies will be successfully completed by the second quarter of calendar with approximately million in remaining costs 
operating loss 
the significant operating loss in million was driven primarily by a million charge for in process research and development expense 
excluding acquisition related expenses including amortization of intangible assets million  deferred stock based compensation million  other non recurring acquisition related expenses million see sg a discussion above  and in process research and development million  our operating income would have been million  or of total revenues 
this compares with an adjusted operating income of million  or of total revenues  in after excluding charges related to the amortization of intangibles million  and deferred stock compensation million 
the decrease in operating income is due in large part to the acquisition of oak technology and the negative operating contribution million being made by the dtv segment which is in the early stages of commercial sales and the temporary operating losses see below of the imaging division million which further added to the operating loss 
within the legacy zoran business  the decline in dvd gross margins was partly offset by improved efficiencies in operating expenses and the million in research and development grants from the chief scientist in israel 
we expect operating margins to improve in due primarily to one time increases in royalty income generated from oak s imaging business 
royalty revenues are recognized on a one quarter lag 
accordingly  approximately million in royalties were earned by oak prior to the acquisition and therefore not recognized as revenue in the post acquisition period 
this created a temporary post acquisition void in the imaging revenue stream of approximately million per quarter 
starting in the first quarter of  that void will have been absorbed in previous periods and all royalties relating to the imaging business will be recognized as income on a one quarter lag 
interest income 
interest income decreased by million to million in compared to million in the reduction was due to a decline in market interest rates and lower average cash balances due to the use of cash in the oak acquisition in august 
provision for income taxes 
excluding charges related to the amortization of goodwill and the write off of acquired in process research and development  our estimated effective tax rate was for unchanged from we currently anticipate that our effective tax rate will increase to in year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
total revenues increased by to million in from million in product sales increased by to million in from million in the increase in product sales resulted primarily from a million increase in sales of dvd products and a million increase in sales of digital camera products 
the increased product sales for both product lines were due to increased unit shipments  partially offset by lower average selling prices 
offsetting these increases somewhat was a million decrease in sales of pc video products due to lower unit shipments 
software  licensing and development revenues increased slightly to million in from million in product gross margin 
product gross margin increased to in compared to in the increase was due to margin improvements in our dvd product line resulting from a shift in product mix to a higher percentage of newer  more cost effective dvd products that are not required to be sold in combination with dvd cpu companion chips which  historically  were sold at low margins 
research and development 
research and development r d expenses decreased by to million in from million in gross r d expenses decreased primarily as a result of the timing of major project expenses such as tape outs 
r d expenses in and did not include any reimbursements from the chief scientist 
r d expenses decreased as a percentage of total revenues to in  compared to in due to the increase in revenue 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased by to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to million of increased marketing and application expenses to support planned revenue growth in our asia pacific markets and million of increased product marketing expenses related to our digital camera products 
amortization of intangible assets 
during  we recorded million and  in charges related to the amortization of intangible assets associated with our acquisitions of nogatech and pixelcam  respectively 
during  we recorded million and  in such charges for nogatech and pixelcam  respectively 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
amortization of goodwill and write off of acquired in process research and development 
based on the adoption of financial accounting standards board fasb statements nos 
and  business combinations and goodwill and other intangible assets sfas and sfas  we did not record charges for the amortization of goodwill during for  we recorded million in goodwill amortization associated with our acquisitions of pixelcam and nogatech in sfas changed the accounting for goodwill from an amortization method to an impairment only approach 
under sfas  goodwill will be tested annually and whenever events or circumstances occur indicating that goodwill might be impaired 
during  we conducted our annual impairment assessment based on our structure as a single reporting unit and determined that no impairment exists 
the in process research and development project acquired from nogatech relates to mpeg technology to be used in video streaming applications 
our marketing plan at the time of the acquisition indicated that the market that we serve would demand products incorporating this technology beginning in the to timeframe 
due to changes in market demand and delays in development we will begin shipping a portion of this technology integrated into coach products that will ship toward the end of the delay in the project will shift projected cash flows out by approximately one to two years 
we estimate that this project will take approximately one year to complete and will cost approximately million 
completion of this project remains a significant risk to the company due to the remaining effort to achieve technical feasibility  rapidly changing customer markets and significant competitive threats from other companies 
failure to bring related products to market in a timely manner could adversely impact our future sales and profitability 
additionally  the value of the intangible assets acquired may become impaired 
interest income 
interest income decreased by million to million in compared to million in the reduction was due to a decline in market interest rates 
other income loss 
in  we incurred other losses of million primarily associated with non cash impairment charges of million and the conversion of equity securities in conjunction with the acquisition of an investee of  in  we recorded other income of  primarily associated with foreign exchange gains net of losses 
during  we recorded a non cash impairment charge of million associated with marketable equity securities that were considered to be other than temporarily impaired 
in determining whether an investment is other than temporarily impaired we consider  among other things  the duration and extent to which the market value has declined relative to our cost basis  the economic factors influencing the markets  the relative performance of the investee and its near term prospects 
there were no such impairment charges for marketable equity securities in also in  we recorded a non cash impairment charge of million associated with non marketable securities 
we review our non marketable investments for impairment when circumstances or events indicate that the carrying value of the investments may not be recoverable 
when the fair value of a non marketable investment declines below its cost basis  we consider all available evidence to evaluate whether a decline in value has occurred 
among other things  we consider the historical and projected financial performance and recent funding events which are ascertained from the investee 
there were no such impairment charges in the non cash loss of  was associated with the acquisition by roxio  inc of mgi software inc as of the date of the acquisition  we held approximately  shares of mgi common stock 
upon consummation of the acquisition  our mgi common stock was exchanged for  shares of roxio common stock 
in connection with the exchange  we recorded a realized loss of  and established a new cost basis of our roxio common stock equal to its fair value on the date of the exchange 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
provision for income taxes 
excluding charges related to the amortization of goodwill and the write off of acquired in process research and development  our estimated effective tax rate was for and compared to in liquidity and capital resources at december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents  million of short term investments and million of investments that have maturity dates that are beyond one year and therefore are classified as other assets 
at december   we had million of working capital 
our operating activities provided cash of million during  primarily due to our million of net income before non cash related expenses including amortization of intangibles and deferred stock compensation  in process research and development and depreciation 
the cash provided from operations was reduced by net changes in current assets and liabilities of million that was fueled primarily by the extension of additional credit in a very competitive market reflected by accounts receivable increasing to days sales outstanding at december  from days at the end of the increase in credit was offset by an increased deferral of payment to our vendors 
the increase in accounts receivable was also offset by receipt of million from sunplus in connection with oak technology s sale of its pc optical storage business to sunplus 
prepaid assets also increased by approximately million due to grant receivables from the chief scientist in israel and an increase of approximately million in interest income receivable 
cash used in investing activities was million during  principally reflecting the purchase of short term and long term marketable investments  net of proceeds from sales and maturities of million offset by the use of million in the oak acquisition 
in addition we spent million for property and equipment which is consistent with the level of spending previously 
cash provided by financing activities was million during and primarily consisted of million received from stock option exercises partially offset by million paid on an installment note related to a previous technology acquisition 
at december  and  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
accordingly  we are not exposed to the type of financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
the following is a summary of fixed payments related to certain contractual obligations in thousands contractual obligation total after operating leases     purchase obligations   debt obligation   total     we believe that our current balances of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  and anticipated cash flow from operations  will satisfy our anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements at least through nonetheless  our future capital requirements may vary materially from those now planned and will depend on many factors including  but not limited to the levels at which we maintain inventory and accounts receivable  the market acceptance of our products  the levels of promotion and advertising required to launch our new products or to enter markets and attain a competitive position in the marketplace  our business  product  capital expenditure and research and development plans and technology roadmap  volume pricing concessions  capital improvements to new and existing facilities  technological advances  the response of competitors to our products  and our relationships with our suppliers and customers 
in addition  we may require an increase in the level of working capital to accommodate planned growth  hiring and infrastructure needs 
additional capital may also be required for consummation of any acquisitions of businesses  products or technologies 
to the extent that our existing resources and cash generated from operations  are insufficient to fund our future activities  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private financings or borrowings 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of debt securities  these securities could have rights  preferences and privileges senior to holders of common stock  and the terms of this debt could impose restrictions on our operations 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain this additional financing  we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned product development and sales and marketing efforts  which could harm our business  financial condition and operating results 
future performance and risk factors our future business  operating results and financial condition are subject to various risks and uncertainties  including those described below 
we are subject to a number of special risks as a result of our recent acquisition of oak technology  inc on august   we completed the acquisition oak  and as a result  we are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties  including the following we will face a number of significant challenges in integrating the technologies  operations and personnel of zoran and oak in a timely and efficient manner  and our failure to do so effectively could have a material adverse effect on the business and operating results of the combined company 
we may not achieve the strategic objectives  cost savings and other anticipated potential benefits of the merger  and our failure to achieve these strategic objectives could have a material adverse effect on our revenues  expenses and operating results 
transaction costs associated with the merger were included as part of the total purchase cost for accounting purposes 
in addition  we incurred charges to operations in the quarter in which the merger was completed 
we may incur additional charges  in amounts not currently estimable  in future quarters to reflect costs associated with integrating the two companies 
these costs could adversely affect our future liquidity and operating results 
historically  oak depended largely on its optical storage business  which during its fiscal year accounted for approximately of oak s revenues 
as a result of the sale of certain assets of its optical storage business in april  oak s digital imaging and digital television businesses now represent the primary source of revenue from the ongoing oak operations  and revenues from these emerging businesses are difficult to forecast 
as a result  it is not possible to use oak s historical financial information to predict its contribution to the future operating results of the combined company 
our quarterly revenues and operating results fluctuate due to a variety of factors  which may result in volatility or a decline in the prices of our stock 
our historical operating results  and those of oak  have varied significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors  including fluctuation in demand for their products  the timing of new product introductions or enhancements by zoran  oak and their competitors  the level of market acceptance of new and enhanced versions of their products and their customers products  the timing or cancellation of large customer orders  the length and variability of the sales cycle for their products  pricing policy changes by zoran  oak and their competitors and suppliers  the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry  the availability of development funding and the timing of development revenue  changes in the mix of products sold  seasonality in demand for their products  increased competition in product lines  and competitive pricing pressures  and the evolving and unpredictable nature of the markets for products incorporating zoran s and oak s integrated circuits and embedded software 
we expect that the operating results of the combined company will continue to fluctuate in the future as a result of these factors and a variety of other factors  including the cost and availability of adequate foundry capacity  fluctuations in manufacturing yields  changes in or the emergence of new industry standards  failure to anticipate changing customer product requirements  the loss or gain of important customers  product obsolescence  and the amount of research and development expenses associated with new product introductions 
the operating results of the combined company could also be harmed by economic conditions generally or in various geographic areas where we or our customers do business  terrorism and international conflicts or other crisis  such as the recent outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome  or sars  other conditions affecting the timing of customer orders  changes in governmental regulations that could affect our products  or a downturn in the markets for our customers products  particularly the consumer electronics market 
these factors are difficult or impossible to forecast 
we place orders with independent foundries several months in advance of the scheduled delivery date  often in advance of receiving non cancelable orders from our customers 
this limits our ability to react to fluctuations in demand for their products 
if anticipated shipments in any quarter are canceled or do not occur as quickly as expected  or if we fail to foresee a technology change that could render a product obsolete  expense and inventory levels could be disproportionately high 
if anticipated license revenues in any quarter are canceled or do not occur  gross margins may be reduced 
a significant portion of our expenses are relatively fixed  and the timing of increases in expenses is based in large part on our forecast of future revenues 
as a result  if revenues do not meet our expectations  we may be unable to quickly adjust expenses to levels appropriate to actual revenues  which could harm our operating results 
product supply and demand fluctuations common to the semiconductor industry are historically characterized by periods of manufacturing capacity shortages immediately followed by periods of overcapacity  which are caused by the addition of manufacturing capacity in large increments 
we cannot predict whether we will achieve timely  cost effective access to that capacity when needed  or if there will be a capacity shortage again in the future 
as a result of these factors  our operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
these fluctuations may be more pronounced in the future as a result of the challenges we face in integrating the operations of zoran and oak 
any shortfall in revenues or net income from levels expected by the investment community could cause a decline in the trading price of our stock 
our customers experience fluctuating product cycles and seasonality  which causes their sales to fluctuate 
because the markets that our customers serve are characterized by numerous new product introductions and rapid product enhancements  our operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
during the final production of a mature product  our customers typically exhaust their existing inventory of our products 
consequently  orders for our products may decline in those circumstances  even if the products are incorporated into both mature products and replacement products 
a delay in a customer s transition to commercial production of a replacement product would delay our ability to recover the lost sales from the discontinuation of the related mature product 
our customers also experience significant seasonality in the sales of their consumer products  which affects their orders of our products 
typically  the second half of the calendar year represents a disproportionate percentage of sales for our customers due to the holiday shopping period for consumer electronics products  and therefore  a disproportionate percentage of our sales 
we expect these seasonal sales fluctuations to continue for the foreseeable future 
product supply and demand in the semiconductor industry is subject to cyclical variations 
the semiconductor industry is subject to cyclical variations in product supply and demand 
downturns in the industry often occur in connection with  or anticipation of  maturing product cycles for both semiconductor companies and their customers and declines in general economic conditions 
these downturns have been characterized by abrupt fluctuations in product demand  production over capacity and accelerated decline of average selling prices 
in some cases  these downturns have lasted more than one year 
a downturn in the semiconductor industry could harm our sales and revenues if demand drops  or our gross margins if average selling prices decline 
our success for the foreseeable future will be dependent on growth in demand for integrated circuits for a limited number of applications 
in recent years  we have derived a substantial majority of our product revenues from the sale of integrated circuits for dvd and digital camera applications 
we expect that sales of our products for these applications will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future 
as a result of oak s sale of its optical storage business  the future financial performance of the former oak operations will depend on our ability to successfully develop and market new products in the digital television  hdtv and digital imaging markets 
if the markets for these products and applications decline or fail to develop as expected  or we are not successful in our efforts to market and sell our products to manufacturers who incorporate integrated circuits into these products  our financial results will be harmed 
our financial performance is highly dependent on the timely and successful introduction of new and enhanced products 
our financial performance depends in large part on our ability to successfully develop and market next generation and new products in a rapidly changing technological environment 
if we fail to successfully identify new product opportunities and timely develop and introduce new products that achieve market acceptance  we may lose our market share and our future revenue and earnings may suffer 
in recent years  our success has been dependent on our successful development and timely introduction of integrated circuits for dvd players  dvd recorders and digital cameras 
these markets are characterized by the incorporation of a steadily increasing level of integration and numbers of features on a chip at the same or lower system cost  enabling original equipment manufacturers  or oems  to continually improve the features or reduce the prices of the systems they sell 
if we are unable to continually develop and introduce integrated circuits with increasing levels of integration and new features at competitive prices  our operating results will suffer 
in the consumer electronics market  oak s performance has been highly dependent upon the successful development and timely introduction of new products and solutions for broadband digital television and hdtv 
in the digital office market  oak s performance has been dependant on its ability to successfully develop embedded image processing system on a chip  or soc  solutions for the digital office market  in particular  embedded digital color copier technology and image processing chips for a variety of imaging peripherals  including printers and multi function peripherals  or mfps 
among other technological changes  embedded pdf and color capability are rapidly emerging as market requirements for printers and other imaging devices 
some of oak s competitors have the capacity to supply these solutions  and some of their solutions have been well received in the marketplace 
we face the challenge of continuing oak s development of digital television and hdtv solutions as well as developing new imaging products with the capability to handle greater color and image complexity  including web based documents  and work with higher performing devices in networked environments 
if we are unable to meet these challenges with the development of products that can effectively compete in the oem software and solutions market  our future operating results could suffer 
we must keep pace with rapid technological changes and evolving industry standards to remain competitive 
our future success will depend on our ability to anticipate and adapt to changes in technology and industry standards and our customers changing demands 
the consumer electronics market  in particular  is characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards  frequent new product introductions  short product life cycles and increasing demand for higher levels of integration 
our ability to adapt to these changes and to anticipate future standards  and the rate of adoption and acceptance of those standards  will be a significant factor in maintaining or improving our competitive position and prospects for growth 
if new industry standards emerge  our products or the products of our customers could become unmarketable or obsolete  and we could lose market share or be required to incur substantial unanticipated costs to comply with these new standards 
our success will also depend on the successful development of new markets and the application and acceptance of new technologies and products in those new markets 
for example  our success will depend on the ability of our customers to develop new products and enhance existing products in the recordable dvd player market and products for the broadband digital television and hdtv markets and to introduce and promote those products successfully 
these markets may not continue to develop to the extent or in the time periods that we currently anticipate due to factors outside our control  such as delays in implementation of fcc requiring all new televisions to include a digital receiver 
if new markets do not develop as we anticipate  or if our products do not gain widespread acceptance in these markets  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
the emergence of new markets for our products is also dependent in part upon third parties developing and marketing content in a format compatible with commercial and consumer products that incorporate our products 
if this content is not available  manufacturers may not be able to sell products incorporating our products  and our sales would suffer 
we rely on independent foundries and contractors for the manufacture  assembly and testing of our integrated circuits and other hardware products  and the failure of any of these third parties to deliver products or otherwise perform as requested could damage our relationships with our customers and harm our sales and financial results 
we do not operate any manufacturing facilities  and we rely on independent foundries to manufacture substantially all of our products 
these independent foundries fabricate products for other companies and may also produce products of their own design 
from time to time  there are manufacturing capacity shortages in the semiconductor industry 
we do not have long term supply contracts with any of our suppliers  including our principal supplier  taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company  or tsmc 
therefore  tsmc and our other suppliers are not obligated to manufacture products for us for any specific period  in any specific quantity or at any specified price  except as may be provided in a particular purchase order 
our reliance on independent foundries involves a number of risks  including the inability to obtain adequate manufacturing capacity  the unavailability of or interruption in access to certain process technologies necessary for manufacture of our products  lack of control over delivery schedules  lack of control over quality assurance  lack of control over manufacturing yields and cost  and potential misappropriation of our intellectual property 
in addition  tsmc and some of our other foundries are located in areas of the world that are subject to natural disasters such as earthquakes 
while the earthquake in taiwan did not have a material impact on our independent foundries  a similar event centered near tsmc s facility could severely reduce tsmc s ability to manufacture our integrated circuits 
the loss of any of our manufacturers as a supplier  our inability to expand the supply of their products in response to increased demand  or our inability to obtain timely and adequate deliveries from our current or future suppliers due to a natural disaster or any other reason could delay or reduce shipments of our products 
any of these circumstances could damage our relationships with current and prospective customers and harm our sales and financial results 
we also rely on a limited number of independent contractors for the assembly and testing of our products 
our reliance on independent assembly and testing houses limits our control over delivery schedules  quality assurance and product cost 
disruptions in the services provided by our assembly or testing houses or other circumstances that would require them to seek alternative sources of assembly or testing could lead to supply constraints or delays in the delivery of our products 
these constraints or delays could damage our relationships with current and prospective customers and harm our financial results 
because foundry capacity is limited from time to time  we may be required to enter into costly long term supply arrangements to secure foundry capacity 
if we are not able to obtain additional foundry capacity as required  our relationships with our customers would be harmed and our sales would likely be reduced 
in order to secure additional foundry capacity  we have considered  and may in the future need to consider  various arrangements with suppliers  which could include  among others option payments or other prepayments to a foundry  nonrefundable deposits with or loans to foundries in exchange for capacity commitments  contracts that commit us to purchase specified quantities of silicon wafers over extended periods  issuance of our equity securities to a foundry  investment in a foundry  joint ventures  or other partnership relationships with foundries 
we may not be able to make any such arrangement in a timely fashion or at all  and such arrangements  if any  may not be on terms favorable to us 
moreover  if we are able to secure foundry capacity  we may be obligated to utilize all of that capacity or incur penalties 
such penalties may be expensive and could harm our financial results 
if our independent foundries do not achieve satisfactory yields  our relationships with our customers may be harmed 
the fabrication of silicon wafers is a complex process 
minute levels of contaminants in the manufacturing environment  defects in photo masks used to print circuits on a wafer  difficulties in the fabrication process or other factors can cause a substantial portion of the integrated circuits on a wafer to be non functional 
many of these problems are difficult to detect at an early stage of the manufacturing process and may be time consuming and expensive to correct 
as a result  foundries often experience problems achieving acceptable yields  which are represented by the number of good integrated circuits as a proportion of the number of total integrated circuits on any particular wafer 
poor yields from our independent foundries would reduce our ability to deliver our products to customers  harm our relationships with our customers and harm our business 
we face competition or potential competition from companies with greater resources than ours  and if we are unable to compete effectively with these companies  our market share may decline and our business could be harmed 
we face intense competition in the markets in which we compete 
we expect that the level of competition will increase in the future from existing competitors and from other companies that may enter our existing or future markets with solutions that may be less costly or provide higher performance or additional features 
competition in zoran s core compression technology market has historically been dominated by large companies  such as st microelectronics  and companies that develop and use their own integrated circuits  such as sony and matsushita 
as this market continues to develop  we face competition from other large semiconductor vendors 
the dvd market continues to expand  and additional competitors are expected to enter the market for dvd players and software 
some of these potential competitors may develop captive implementations for use only with their own pc and consumer electronics products 
it is also possible that application software vendors  such as microsoft  may attempt to enter the dvd application market in the future 
this increased competition may result in price reductions  reduced profit margins and loss of market share 
we face competition from several large semiconductor companies in the broadband digital television and set top box markets 
we expect competition to continue to increase in these markets as industry standards become well known and as other competitors enter these markets 
we also face significant competition in the digital office market 
the future growth of the digital office market is highly dependent on oems continuing to outsource an increasing portion of their product development work 
while the trend toward outsourcing on the part of our oem customers in this market has accelerated in recent years  any reversal of this trend  or a change in the way they outsource  could seriously harm our business 
many of our existing competitors  as well as oem customers that are expected to compete with us in the future  have substantially greater financial  manufacturing  technical  marketing  distribution and other resources  broader product lines and longer standing relationships with customers than we have 
in addition  much of our future success is dependent on the success of our oem customers 
if we or our oem customers are unable to compete successfully against current and future competitors  we could experience price reductions  order cancellations and reduced gross margins  any one of which could harm our business 
our products are characterized by average selling prices that decline over relatively short time periods  if we are unable to reduce our costs or introduce new products with higher average selling prices  our financial results will suffer 
average selling prices for our products decline over relatively short time periods  while many of our manufacturing costs are fixed 
when our average selling prices decline  our revenues decline unless we are able to sell more units  and our gross margins decline unless we are able to reduce our manufacturing costs by a commensurate amount 
our operating results suffer when gross margins decline 
we have experienced these problems  and we expect to continue to experience them in the future  although we cannot predict when they may occur or how severe they will be 
we derive most of our revenue from sales to a small number of large customers  and if we are not able to retain these customers  or they reschedule  reduce or cancel orders  our revenues would be reduced and our financial results would suffer 
zoran s and oak s largest customers have accounted for a substantial percentage of their revenues 
in  sales to fujifilm accounted for approximately of zoran s total revenues  and zoran s four largest customers accounted for approximately of its total revenues 
similarly  during oak s fiscal  oak s top customers accounted for approximately of its total revenues 
sales to these large customers have varied significantly from year to year and will continue to fluctuate in the future 
these sales also may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter 
we may not be able to retain our key customers  or these customers may cancel purchase orders or reschedule or decrease their level of purchases from us 
any substantial decrease or delay in sales to one or more of our key customers could harm our sales and financial results 
in addition  any difficulty in collecting amounts due from one or more key customers could harm our financial results 
fujifilm has been our largest customer over the last six years 
fujifilm purchases our products primarily as a reseller 
fujifilm acts as the primary reseller in japan of products developed by us under development contracts with fujifilm 
we may sell these products directly in japan only to specified customers with fujifilm s consent 
fujifilm provides more sales and marketing support than our other resellers 
fujifilm has also provided funding to support zoran s development efforts 
if our relationship with fujifilm were terminated  our business could be harmed 
our products generally have long sales cycles and implementation periods  which increases our costs in obtaining orders and reduces the predictability of our operating results 
our products are technologically complex 
prospective customers generally must make a significant commitment of resources to test and evaluate our products and to integrate them into larger systems 
as a result  our sales processes are often subject to delays associated with lengthy approval processes that typically accompany the design and testing of new products 
the sales cycles of our products often last for many months or even years 
longer sales cycles require us to invest significant resources in attempting to make sales and delay the generation of revenue 
long sales cycles also subject us to other risks  including customers budgetary constraints  internal acceptance reviews and cancellations 
in addition  orders expected in one quarter could shift to another because of the timing of customers purchase decisions 
the time required for our customers to incorporate our products into their own can vary significantly with the needs of our customers and generally exceeds several months  which further complicates our planning processes and reduces the predictability of our operating results 
we are not protected by long term contracts with our customers 
we generally do not enter into long term purchase contracts with our customers  and we cannot be certain as to future order levels from our customers 
customers generally purchase our products subject to cancelable short term purchase orders 
we cannot predict whether our current customers will continue to place orders  whether existing orders will be canceled  or whether customers who have ordered products will pay invoices for delivered products 
when we do enter into a long term contract  the contract is generally terminable at the convenience of the customer 
in the event of an early termination by one of our major customers  it is unlikely that we will be able to rapidly replace that revenue source  which would harm our financial results 
regulation of our customers products may slow the process of introducing new products and could impair our ability to compete 
the federal communications commission  or fcc  has broad jurisdiction over our target markets in the digital television business we acquired from oak 
various international entities or organizations may also regulate aspects of our business or the business of our customers 
although our products are not directly subject to regulation by any agency  the transmission pipes  as well as much of the equipment into which our products are incorporated  are subject to direct government regulation 
for example  before they can be sold in the united states  advanced televisions and emerging interactive displays must be tested and certified by underwriters laboratories and meet fcc regulations 
accordingly  the effects of regulation on our customers or the industries in which our customers operate may in turn harm our business 
fcc regulatory policies affecting the ability of cable operators or telephone companies to offer certain services and other terms on which these companies conduct their business may impede sales of our products 
in addition  our digital television business may also be adversely affected by the imposition of tariffs  duties and other import restrictions on our suppliers or by the imposition of export restrictions on products that we sell internationally 
changes in current laws or regulations or the imposition of new laws or regulations in the united states or elsewhere could harm our business 
for example  any delays by the fcc in imposing its pending requirement that all new televisions have a digital receiver could have an adverse effect on our hdtv business 
we are dependent upon our international sales and operations  economic  political or military events in a country where we make significant sales or have significant operations could interfere with our success or operations there and harm our business 
during  of our total revenues and of oak s total revenues were derived from international sales 
we anticipate that international sales will continue to account for the majority of our total revenues for the foreseeable future 
in addition  substantially all of our semiconductor products are manufactured  assembled and tested outside of the united states by independent foundries and subcontractors 
we are subject to the risks inherent in doing business internationally  including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  fluctuations in exchange rates  political and economic instability  imposition of tariffs and other barriers and restrictions  the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws  and health risks in a particular region 
a material amount of our research and development personnel and facilities and a portion of our sales and marketing personnel are located in israel 
political  economic and military conditions in israel directly affect our operations 
some of our officers and employees in israel are obligated to perform up to days of military reserve duty annually 
the absence of these employees for significant periods during the work week may cause us to operate inefficiently during these periods 
our operations in china are subject to the economic and political uncertainties affecting that country 
for example  the chinese economy has experienced significant growth in the past decade  but such growth has been uneven across geographic and economic sectors 
this growth may decrease and any slowdown may have a negative effect on our business 
we also maintain offices in taipei  taiwan  hong kong and seoul  korea  and our operations are subject to the economic and political uncertainties affecting these countries as well 
the significant concentration of our manufacturing activities with third party foundries in taiwan exposes us to the risk of political instability in taiwan  including the potential for conflict between taiwan and china 
we have several significant oem customers in japan  korea and other parts of asia 
adverse economic circumstances in japan and elsewhere in asia could affect these customers willingness or ability to do business with us in the future or their success in developing and launching devices containing our products 
our business and future operating results could be harmed by terrorist activity or armed conflict 
our business and operating results are subject to uncertainties arising out of possible terrorist attacks on the united states and other regions of the world including locations where we maintain operations and by armed conflict in the middle east and related economic instability 
our operations could be harmed due to disruption in commercial activities associated with heightened security concerns affecting international travel and commerce  reduced demand for consumer electronic products due to a potential extension of the global economic slowdown  tightened immigration controls that may adversely affect the residence status of key non us managers and technical employees in our us facilities or our ability to hire new us employees in such facilities  or potential expansion of armed conflict in the middle east which could adversely affect our operations in israel 
the prices of our products may become less competitive due to foreign exchange fluctuations 
foreign currency fluctuations may affect the prices of our products 
prices for our products are currently denominated in us dollars for sales to our customers throughout the world 
if there is a significant devaluation of the currency in a specific country  the prices of our products will increase relative to that country s currency  and our products may be less competitive in that country 
also  we cannot be sure that our international customers will continue to be willing to place orders denominated in us dollars 
if they do not  our revenue and operating results will be subject to foreign exchange fluctuations 
our ability to compete could be jeopardized if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights 
our success and ability to compete depend in large part upon protection of our proprietary technology 
we rely on a combination of patent  trade secret  copyright and trademark laws  non disclosure and other contractual agreements and technical measures to protect our proprietary rights 
these agreements and measures may not be sufficient to protect our technology from third party infringement  or to protect us from the claims of others 
monitoring unauthorized use of our products is difficult  and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use of our technology  particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
the laws of certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be developed  manufactured or sold  including various countries in asia  may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states and thus make the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely in these countries 
if competitors are able to use our technology  our ability to compete effectively could be harmed 
the protection offered by patents is subject to numerous uncertainties 
for example  our competitors may be able to effectively design around our patents  or the patents may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
those competitors may also independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology 
moreover  while we hold  or have applied for  patents relating to the design of our products  some of our products are based in part on standards  for which we do not hold patents or other intellectual property rights 
oak has generally limited access to and distribution of the source and object code of its software and other proprietary information 
with respect to its page description language software and drivers for the digital office market and in limited circumstances with respect to firmware and platforms for its hdtv products  oak has granted licenses that give its customers access to and restricted use of the source code of oak s software 
this access increases the likelihood of misappropriation or misuse of our technology 
oak is a defendant in several lawsuits 
oak is a party to various legal proceedings  including a number of patent related lawsuits 
in connection with these lawsuits  management time has been  and will continue to be  expended 
in addition  while oak has incurred  and we expect to continue to incur  substantial legal and other expenses in connection with these pending lawsuits  an estimate of such loss or range of loss cannot be made 
no provision for any liability that may result upon adjudication has been made in our financial statements 
we could become subject to claims and litigation regarding intellectual property rights  which could seriously harm its business and require it to incur significant costs 
in recent years  there has been significant litigation in the united states involving patents and other intellectual property rights 
in the past  zoran and oak have been subject to claims and litigation regarding alleged infringement of other parties intellectual property rights  and both oak and zoran are currently parties to a number of patent related lawsuits 
we could become subject to additional litigation in the future  either to protect our intellectual property or as a result of allegations that we infringe others intellectual property rights 
claims that our products infringe proprietary rights would force us to defend ourselves and possibly our customers or manufacturers against the alleged infringement 
these claims and any resulting lawsuit  if successful  could subject us to significant liability for damages or invalidation of our proprietary rights 
these lawsuits  regardless of their success  would likely be time consuming and expensive to resolve and would divert management time and attention 
any potential intellectual property litigation could force us to do one or more of the following stop selling products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property  obtain from the owner of the infringed intellectual property right a license to sell or use the relevant technology  which license may not be available on reasonable terms or at all  pay damages  or redesign those products that use such technology 
although patent disputes in the semiconductor industry have often been settled through cross licensing arrangements  we may not be able in any or every instance to settle an alleged patent infringement claim through a cross licensing arrangement 
we have a more limited patent portfolio than many of our competitors 
if a successful claim is made against us or any of our customers and a license is not made available to us on commercially reasonable terms or we are required to pay substantial damages or awards  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
if necessary licenses of third party technology are not available to us or are very expensive  our products could become obsolete 
from time to time  we may be required to license technology from third parties to develop new products or product enhancements 
third party licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain any third party license required to develop new products and product enhancements  we may have to obtain substitute technology of lower quality or performance standards or at greater cost  either of which could seriously harm the competitiveness of our products 
certain technology used in our products is licensed from third parties  and in connection with these licenses  we are required to fulfill confidentiality obligations and  in some cases  pay royalties 
some of our products require various types of copy protection software that we must license from third parties 
if we are unable to obtain or maintain our right to use the necessary copy protection software  we would be unable to sell and market these products 
if we are not able to apply our net operating losses against taxable income in future periods  our financial results will be harmed 
our future net income and cash flow will be affected by our ability to apply our net operating losses  or nols  against taxable income in future periods 
our nols totaled approximately million for federal and million for state tax reporting purposes as of december  as a result of the change of control resulting from our initial public offering in  the amount of nols that we can use to reduce future taxable income for federal tax purposes is limited to approximately million per year 
the internal revenue code contains a number of provisions that could limit the use of nols against income of the combined company as a result of the merger or as a result of the combination of these transactions 
our utilization of oak s nols may be further limited due to prior oak transactions 
no opinion or irs ruling has been sought regarding the potential application of any of these provisions 
changes in tax laws in the united states may further limit our ability to utilize these nols 
any further limitation on our ability to utilize these respective nols could harm our financial condition 
any additional acquisitions we make could disrupt our business and severely harm our financial condition 
we have made investments in  and acquisitions of  other complementary companies  products and technologies 
we have recently completed the acquisition of oak  and we may acquire additional businesses  products or technologies in the future 
in the event of any future acquisitions  we could issue stock that would dilute its current stockholders percentage ownership  incur debt  assume liabilities  incur expenses related to the future impairment of goodwill and the amortization of other intangible assets  or incur other large write offs immediately or in the future 
our operation of any other acquired business will also involve numerous risks  including problems combining the purchased operations  technologies or products  unanticipated costs  diversion of management s attention from our core business  adverse effects on existing business relationships with customers  risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience  and potential loss of key employees  particularly those of the purchased organizations 
we may not be able to successfully complete the integration of the business  products or technologies or personnel that we might acquire in the future  and any failure to do so could disrupt our business and seriously harm our financial condition 
in addition  we have made minority equity investments in early stage companies  and we expect to continue to review opportunities to make additional investments in such companies where we believe such investments will provide us with opportunities to gain access to important technologies or otherwise enhance important commercial relationships 
we have little or no influence over the early stage companies in which we have made or may make strategic  minority equity investments 
each of these investments involves a high degree of risk 
we may not be successful in achieving the technological or commercial advantage upon which any given investment is premised  and failure by the early stage company to achieve its own business objectives could result in a loss of all or part of our invested capital and require us to write off all or a portion of such investment 
our products could contain defects  which could reduce sales of those products or result in claims against us 
we develop complex and evolving products 
despite testing by us and our customers  errors may be found in existing or new products 
this could result in  among other things  a delay in recognition or loss of revenues  loss of market share or failure to achieve market acceptance 
these defects may cause us to incur significant warranty  support and repair costs  divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts and harm our relationships with customers 
the occurrence of these problems could result in the delay or loss of market acceptance of our products and would likely harm our business 
defects  integration issues or other performance problems in our products could result in financial or other damages to customers or could damage market acceptance of such products 
our customers could also seek damages from us for their losses 
a product liability claim brought against us  even if unsuccessful  would likely be time consuming and costly to defend 
if we do not maintain current development contracts or are unable to enter into new development contracts  our business could be harmed 
we historically have generated a portion of our total revenues from development contracts  primarily with key customers 
these development contracts have provided us with partial funding for the development of some of our products 
under these contracts  we receive payments upon reaching certain development milestones 
if we fail to achieve the milestones specified in our existing development contracts  if our existing contracts are terminated or if we are unable to secure future development contracts  our ability to cost effectively develop new products would be reduced and our business would be harmed 
we may need additional funds to execute our business plan  and if we are unable to obtain such funds  we will not be able to expand our business as planned 
we may require substantial additional capital to finance our future growth  secure additional foundry capacity and fund our ongoing research and development activities beyond our capital requirements will depend on many factors  including acceptance of and demand for our products  the types of arrangements that we may enter into with our independent foundries  the extent to which we invest in new technology and research and development projects  and any additional acquisitions that we may make 
to the extent that our existing sources of liquidity and cash flow from operations are insufficient to fund our activities  we may need to raise additional funds 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities  the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders would be reduced 
further  such equity securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of our common stock 
additional financing may not be available to us when needed or  if available  it may not be available on terms favorable to us 
if we fail to manage our future growth  if any  our business would be harmed 
we anticipate that our future growth  if any  will require us to recruit and hire a substantial number of new engineering  managerial  sales and marketing personnel 
our ability to manage growth successfully will also require us to expand and improve administrative  operational  management and financial systems and controls 
many of our key operations  including a material portion of our research and development operations and a significant portion of our sales and administrative operations  are located in israel 
a majority of our sales and marketing and certain of our research and development and administrative personnel  including our president and chief executive officer and other officers  are based in the united states 
the geographic separation of these operations places additional strain on our resources and our ability to manage growth effectively 
if we are unable to manage growth effectively  our business will be harmed 
we rely on the services of our executive officers and other key personnel  whose knowledge of our business and industry would be extremely difficult to replace 
our success depends to a significant degree upon the continuing contributions of our senior management 
management and other employees may voluntarily terminate their employment with us at any time upon short notice 
the loss of key personnel could delay product development cycles or otherwise harm our business 
we believe that our future success will also depend in large part on our ability to attract  integrate and retain highly skilled engineering  managerial  sales and marketing personnel  located in the united states  israel and china 
competition for such personnel is intense  and we may not be successful in attracting  integrating and retaining such personnel 
failure to attract  integrate and retain key personnel could harm our ability to carry out our business strategy and compete with other companies 
the israeli rate of inflation may negatively impact our costs if it exceeds the rate of devaluation of the new israeli shekel against the united states dollar 
a portion of the cost of our operations  relating mainly to our personnel and facilities in israel  is incurred in new israeli shekels 
as a result  we bear the risk that the rate of inflation in israel will exceed the rate of devaluation of the new israeli shekel in relation to the united states dollar  which will increase our costs as expressed in united states dollars 
to date  we have not engaged in hedging transactions 
in the future  we may enter into currency hedging transactions to decrease the risk of financial exposure from fluctuations in the exchange rate of the united states dollar against the new israeli shekel 
these measures may not adequately protect us from the impact of inflation in israel 
the government programs in which we participate and tax benefits we receive require us to meet several conditions and may be terminated or reduced in the future  which would increase our costs 
historically  we have financed a portion of our research and development activities with grants for research and development from the chief scientist in israel s ministry of industry and trade 
although we did not receive proceeds from such grants in or  we did earn such proceeds in and we plan to seek additional grants from the chief scientist in the future 
to be eligible for these grants  our development projects must be approved by the chief scientist on a case by case basis 
if our development projects are not approved by the chief scientist  we will not receive grants to fund these projects  which would increase our research and development costs 
we also receive tax benefits  in particular exemptions and reductions as a result of the approved enterprise status of our existing operations in israel 
to be eligible for these tax benefits  we must maintain our approved enterprise status by meeting conditions  including making specified investments in fixed assets located in israel and investing additional equity in our israeli subsidiary 
if we fail to meet these conditions in the future  the tax benefits would be canceled and we could be required to refund the tax benefits already received 
these tax benefits may not be continued in the future at their current levels or at any level 
israeli governmental authorities have indicated that the government may reduce or eliminate these benefits in the future  which would harm our business 
provisions in our charter documents and delaware law could prevent or delay a change in control of zoran 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders 
these include prohibitions prohibiting a merger with a party that has acquired control of or more of our outstanding common stock  such as a party that has completed a successful tender offer  until three years after that party acquired control of of our outstanding common stock  authorizing the issuance of up to  shares of blank check preferred stock  eliminating stockholders rights to call a special meeting of stockholders  and requiring advance notice of any stockholder nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors 
our stock price has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate widely 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly since our initial public offering in between january  and december   the closing sale price of our common stock  as reported on the nasdaq national market  ranged from a low of to a high of 
the market price of our common stock is subject to significant fluctuations in the future in response to a variety of factors  including announcements concerning our business or that of our competitors or customers  quarterly variations in operating results  changes in analysts earnings estimates  announcements of technological innovations  the introduction of new products or changes in product pricing policies by zoran or its competitors  loss of key personnel  proprietary rights or other litigation  general conditions in the semiconductor industry  and developments in the financial markets 
in addition  the stock market has  from time to time  experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices for semiconductor companies or technology companies generally and which have been unrelated to the operating performance of the affected companies 
broad market fluctuations of this type may reduce the future market price of our common stock 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s we are exposed to financial market risks including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the fair value of our investment portfolio or related income would not be significantly impacted by either a increase or decrease in interest rates due mainly to the short term nature of the major portion of our investment portfolio 
a majority of our revenue and capital spending is transacted in us dollars  although a portion of the cost of our operations  relating mainly to our personnel and facilities in israel  is incurred in new israeli shekels 
we have not engaged in hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to fluctuations that may arise from changes in foreign exchange rates 
based on our overall currency rate exposure at december   a near term appreciation or depreciation of the new israeli shekel would have an immaterial affect on our financial condition
