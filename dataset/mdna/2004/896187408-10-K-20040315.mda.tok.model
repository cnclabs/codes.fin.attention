item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our business is to design  manufacture market and sell advanced production equipment and related support services that are used in the production of semiconductors 
we face a variety of challenges in responding to the dynamics of this industry  which is characterized by a high level of volatility caused by sudden changes in demand for semiconductors and manufacturing capacity 
in addition because of the large unit price associated with our systems  which typically vary between million and million  our backlog  shipments and revenues can be affected positively  or negatively  by a relatively small swing in orders 
our revenues during the three fiscal years ending december  were substantially affected by the rapid reduction in demand for semiconductor equipment that began towards the end of fiscal as fiscal progressed  the decline in demand deepened and the industry entered a severe downturn 
this downturn continued into fiscal and while there have been indications that an industry recovery started in the second half of  we did not benefit from this recovery in fiscal in addition to the initial sale of equipment  we also provide on site support and spares parts 
sales of on site support and spare parts were million and million including sales of our cnc subsidiary of million and million for the years ended december  and respectively 
the sales of support and spares is less volatile than the sale of the equipment 
critical accounting policies general our discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles 
note to notes to consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
certain of these accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies as defined below 
a critical accounting policy is defined as one that is both material to the presentation of our financial statements and requires management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
specifically  critical accounting estimates generally require us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate  and 
table of contents if different estimates or judgments were used would have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
the estimates and judgments we make that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses are based on our historical experience and on various other factors which we believe to be reasonable in the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we consider our accounting policies related to revenue recognition  foreign currency translation  the valuation of inventories including demonstration inventory and accounting for the costs of installation and warranty obligations to be critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition we derive our revenues from three sources equipment sales  spare parts sales and the provision of services 
we changed our revenue recognition policy in fiscal to adopt staff accounting bulletin issued by the staff of the securities and exchange commission 
we recognize revenue when all the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectivity is reasonably assured 
for transactions that consist of multiple deliverables we allocate revenue to each of the deliverables based upon relative fair values and apply the revenue recognition criteria above to each element 
generally  we recognize revenue on shipment  as the equipment is pre tested in the factory prior to shipment and our terms of business are fob factory 
for new customers  or new products  revenue is recognized on shipment only if the customer attends and approves the pre shipment testing procedures and we  and the customer  are satisfied that the performance of the equipment  once installed and operated  will meet the customer defined specifications 
generally even with new customers we recognize the revenue on shipment because the customer attends and approves the pre shipment testing 
the amount of revenue recorded is reduced by the amount of any customer retention typically between and  which is not payable by the customer until installation is completed and final customer acceptance is achieved 
the amount of revenue related to system shipments and customer retentions deferred at december  was million compared to million at december  generally the provision of installation and commissioning services are not considered essential to the functionality of the equipment 
equipment sold as demonstration or evaluation units are recognized as revenue on transfer of title and  either final acceptance  or satisfactory completion of testing to demonstrate that the equipment meets all the customer defined specifications 
revenue related to spare parts is recognized on shipment 
revenue related to service contracts is recognized ratably over the duration of the contracts 
during fiscal we entered into a contract to develop new equipment for a customer and we determined that the revenue associated with this transaction should be accounted for in accordance with sop accounting for the performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
the developed equipment was shipped to the customer in fiscal  however significant development work will be required during fiscal and no revenue was recognized with respect to this project in fiscal the full value of the contract has been deferred until such time as we can establish criteria to recognize the revenue under the percentage of completion method or alternatively on completion of the contract 
deferred revenue at december  includes million in respect of this contract 
foreign currency translation most of our operations are located within the united kingdom and most of our costs are incurred in british pounds 
however our system sales are generally in us dollars and  to a lesser extent  in euro and we report in us 
table of contents dollars 
as a result  fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the british pound have a significant effect on our reported earnings and net asset position 
we have determined that the functional currency for all uk operations is the british pound and as a result our actual expenses expressed in us dollars will fluctuate with changes in foreign currency exchange rates and result in currency gains and losses  which are charged to net income 
changes in the value of non us net assets as a result of these movements of foreign currency exchange rates are treated as changes to the cumulative translation adjustment on the balance sheet 
we also have significant intercompany loans between the united kingdom operating subsidiary and the parent  which are short term in nature 
this determination results in exchange gains and losses associated with these loans being accounted for in the profit and loss account 
inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value  using standard costs which approximate to actual cost 
we maintain a perpetual inventory system and continuously record the quantity on hand and standard cost of each product including purchased components  sub assemblies and finished goods 
we maintain the integrity of the perpetual inventory through a cycle stock count program 
our standard costs are re assessed at least annually and generally reflect the most recent purchase cost and currently achievable assembly and test labor and overhead rates 
we estimate our labor and overhead rates based upon average utilization rates and treat as a period cost abnormal absorption variances  which arise due to low or high production volumes 
as a result of the low levels of production  significant negative volume variances are being experienced  which has resulted in a gross margin that is below levels that could be achieved at higher revenue levels 
we also make provision for slow moving and obsolete inventory and evaluate their adequacy on a quarterly basis 
for our work in process and finished goods inventory  which generally consist of specific systems or modules  we compare the inventory on hand to current sales and market forecasts and other information that indicates the ability to identify a purchaser for such equipment 
we apply a formula approach to reserves against raw materials and spares inventory based upon months historic usage  applying different criteria to components that are required for current products  non current products and spares 
a major component of the estimate of inventory reserves is our forecast of future customer demand  technological and or market obsolescence  and general semiconductor market conditions 
if future customer demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections then additional inventory write downs may be required  and these would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the reserves were adjusted 
installation and warranty our contracts cover on site installation services and provide for a warranty of the equipment 
generally we accrue for the costs of installation and commissioning services at the time of revenue recognition 
our standard warranty period varies from to months  depending on a number of factors including the specific equipment purchased 
we account for the estimated warranty cost as a charge to cost of sales at the time we recognize revenue 
the warranty reserve is based upon historic product performance and is based on a rolling month average historic cost per machine per warranty month outstanding 
we also recalculate the estimated warranty cost for all remaining systems still under warranty using the most recent historic average and the difference is included as a component of cost of sales 
we do not maintain any general reserves for warranty obligations 
actual warranty costs in the future may vary from historic costs  which could result in adjustments to our warranty reserves in future periods that are more volatile than in recent years 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth certain operating data as a percentage of total revenue for the periods indicated years ended december  consolidated statements of operations data revenues product sales licence revenues total revenues costs of goods sold gross profit operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative settlement of pension liabilities and related expenses total operating expenses loss income from operations foreign currency gains losses other income interest income expense  net loss income before income tax charge income tax charge credit net loss income comparison of the years ended december  and product sales 
product sales for the year ended december  decreased to million compared to million for the year ended december  shipments for the year ended december  were million compared to million shipped in the prior year 
the level of sales and shipments in the year reflects the effects of the global slowdown in the semiconductor industry 
our sales by product are as follows year ended december  pvd cvd etch spares and support total sales outside of the united states accounted for approximately and of total revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we expect that sales outside of the united states will continue to represent a significant percentage of our product sales through 
table of contents because of the large unit price associated with our systems  our product sales are represented by a small number of unit sales in each year and therefore the quantity  product mix and geographical mix of product shipped in any particular year can fluctuate significantly as can the individual customers to whom these products are sold 
license revenues 
license revenues are in respect of an exclusive license of power supply technology and a non exclusive license of our mori technology to a systems integrator in japan for a non competing application 
license revenues increased to  for the year ended december  compared to  received during the year ended december license revenues are expected to continue to represent a small part of our revenue 
gross margin on product sales 
the gross margin on product revenues for the year ended december  was as compared to for the year ended december  cost of goods sold for the year ended december  included  relating to the costs of a reduction in workforce compared to  in the year ended december  cost of goods sold for the year ended december  also included a non cash charge of million with respect to the write down of inventory associated with the current downturn in the semiconductor business compared to million in the prior year 
better utilization of manufacturing costs positively impacted the gross margin in fiscal but this was offset in part by an unfavorable product mix compared to research and development expenses 
research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million or of total revenues compared with million or of total revenues for the prior year 
the major focus of our research and development efforts continues to be the development of new processes in further advancing our proprietary pvd  cvd and etch technologies as well as adding enhancements to our existing products 
we are committed to continued investment in our research and development and expect that our research and development expenses for will continue to be incurred at similar or greater levels to fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million  or of total revenues  compared to million  or of total revenues  in the year ended december  as the majority of our costs are incurred in british pounds  in local currency terms our expenses declined in fiscal compared to fiscal while selling general and administrative expenses when reported in us dollars for the year ended december  compared to the prior year increased  the movement in the us dollar exchange rate to the british pound increased reported expenses by 
in addition  in fiscal we incurred non recurring costs associated with employer social security taxes relating to the vesting of  shares  a contested annual shareholder meeting  accruals with respect to leasehold buildings no longer used by the company and the changeover of the chief executive officer  which totaled result from operations 
we incurred a loss from operations of million in the year ended december  compared to a loss of million in the prior year 
lower revenue was the major component of the increase in the loss from operations 
the pension settlement charge of million in the year ended december  compared to  in the year ended december  had a significant effect upon the result of operations for fiscal see note  pensions and other post retirement benefits to the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents other income 
we earned  during the year ended december  in connection with the sale of property we no longer required for our operations 
interest income and expense  net 
net interest income was  for the year ended december  compared with  for the year ended december  net interest income was reduced in the year ended december  compared to the prior year  in part due to lower cash balances  but also due to interest payable on taxes outstanding from the prior year  which were settled during the year 
income taxes 
for the year ended december  we recorded a tax charge of million compared to a tax credit of million for year ended december  resulting in an effective income tax rate of and  respectively 
the current year tax charge primarily relates to us state franchise taxes and to income taxes in our german subsidiary 
we generated a significant portion of our consolidated pre tax losses for the year ended december  and december  within the united kingdom  which has a lower statutory rate of compared to the us federal rate of 
in addition to the lower statutory rate  the generation of net operating losses results in fluctuations in the effective tax rate  as we have not recognized any deferred tax assets with respect to net operating losses  which can only be utilized against future profits 
we incurred united kingdom income taxes in fiscal and we were able to carry back some of the tax losses incurred in the united kingdom during fiscal against these taxes 
see note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed reconciliation of the tax rate for and as of december   we had us federal losses of million  various state operating losses and united kingdom net operating losses of approximately million  which can be offset against future income 
our ability to use our us and united kingdom net operating losses and credit carry forwards will depend upon the ability to generate future income within the us and united kingdom to utilize these losses and a portion of our us net operating losses are subject to annual limitations arising from a change of control as defined by section of the internal revenue code  as revised 
in addition to the united states and the united kingdom  we have operating subsidiaries in several other countries  and each of these subsidiaries are taxed based on the laws of the jurisdiction in which they operate 
because taxes are incurred at the subsidiary level  and one subsidiary s tax losses cannot be used to offset the taxable income of subsidiaries in other jurisdictions  our consolidated effective tax rate can vary significantly to the extent we report tax losses in some subsidiaries and taxable income in others 
we also assume that our profits generated in overseas jurisdictions are reinvested overseas 
the payment of dividends or distributions by the subsidiaries to the united states may be subject to withholding taxes in the country of domicile and further taxation by federal or state authorities subject to the terms or relevant double tax treaties 
comparison of the years ended december  and product sales 
product sales for the year ended december  decreased to million compared to million for the year ended december  shipments for the year ended december  were million compared to million shipped in the prior year 
the decline in sales and shipments in the year reflects the effects of the protracted global slowdown in the semiconductor industry 
our revenues in fiscal reflected our significant backlog from fiscal  prior to the onset of a global slowdown 

table of contents our sales by product are as follows year ended december  pvd cvd etch spares total sales outside of the united states accounted for approximately and of total revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively 
revenues for the year ended december  included cancellation fees of million 
license revenues 
license revenues of  in the year ended december  related to power supply technology 
no license revenues were earned during the year ended december  gross margin on product sales 
the gross margin on product revenues for the year ended december  was as compared to for the year ended december  cost of goods sold for the year ended december  included  relating to the costs of a reduction in workforce compared to  in the year ended december  cost of goods sold for the year ended december  also included a non cash charge of million with respect to the write down of inventory compared to million in the prior year 
in addition  under utilization of manufacturing and customer support costs negatively affected the gross margin in the year ended december  sales of higher margin products and a receipt of fees for order cancellations offset  somewhat  the factors contributing to the reduced gross margin in the year ended december  research and development expenses 
research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million or of total revenues compared with million or of total revenues for the prior year 
the major focus of our research and development efforts continued to be the development of new processes in further advancing our proprietary pvd  cvd and etch technologies as well as adding enhancements to our existing products 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million  or of total revenues  compared to million  or of total revenues  in the year ended december  while the reduction in selling  general and administrative expenses when reported in us dollars for the year ended december  compared to the prior year was only  the movement in the us dollar exchange rate to the british pound had an adverse effect on selling  general and administration by such that the saving in real terms was 
results from operations 
as a result of the decrease in revenue for the year ended december  and our strategy to keep our key infrastructure in place during the cyclical industry downturn  we incurred a loss from operations of million or of revenue compared with income from operations of million or of revenue in the prior year 

table of contents other income 
we earned  during the year ended december  in connection with the sale of property we no longer required for our operations 
interest income and expense  net 
net interest income was  for the year ended december  compared with net interest expense of  for the year ended december  the achievement of interest income is due primarily to interest income received on increased cash balances during fiscal offsetting interest expense on the bank term loan 
in addition  interest cost on our subordinated convertible notes ceased in following their payment in full in october income taxes 
for the year ended december   we recorded a tax credit of million compared to a charge of million for year ended december  resulting in an effective income tax rate of and  respectively 
we generated a significant portion of our consolidated pre tax losses for the year ended december   and pre tax income for the year ended december   within the united kingdom  which has a lower statutory rate of compared to the us federal rate of 
in addition to the lower statutory rate  the generation and use of net operating losses results in fluctuations in the effective tax rate  as we have not recognized any deferred tax assets with respect to net operating losses  which can only be utilized against future profits 
we incurred united kingdom income taxes in fiscal and we were able to carry back some of the tax losses incurred in the united kingdom during fiscal against these taxes 
the remaining operating losses in the year ended december   are carried forward to future periods and we did not recognize a deferred tax asset with respect to these losses 
see note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed reconciliation of the tax rate for and liquidity and capital resources at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents  compared to million at december  the primary uses of cash in the year ended december  were operations  which used million 
in addition we invested million in property  plant and equipment  net of retirements and repaid million of our term loan facility with a british bank and  with respect to our leasing facilities 
in october  our cash and cash equivalents were increased as a result of the sale of  shares of our common stock  in a private transaction with an institutional shareholder 
the net proceeds that we received amounted to approximately million 
we also disposed of our prior united kingdom head office building  which had been unused since this sale generated approximately million net of costs of disposal 
in addition  the effect of exchange rate changes was an increase of million on our cash and cash equivalents at december  at december   we had a term loan from a british bank with a balance outstanding of million british pounds compared to million british pounds at december  approximately million and million  respectively  at the respective year end exchange rates 
the term loan at december  bore interest at the three month london interbank borrowing rate libor plus per annum payable at an annual rate of as at december  and also carried no prepayment penalties 
this term loan was repaid in january in july we entered into a two year revolving credit facility for million british pounds approximately million at the december  exchange rate or its equivalent in any other allowed currency 
table of contents facility 
interest on the facility  will be incurred at libor plus for borrowings in british pounds and at the banks short term offered rate plus for loans in any other currency 
no amounts are outstanding under this facility at december  the facility included financial covenants that required we maintain a consolidated net worth of not less than million  and that our interest expense on the loan does not exceed  british pounds in any one fiscal quarter 
in march by way of an amendment letter  the covenant to maintain a consolidated net worth of not less than million was changed to the reduced amount of not less than million 
at december  our consolidated net worth was million 
the primary factors that affect our consolidated net worth are foreign currency translation and net losses 
to the extent the us dollar strengthens against the british pound or we incur net losses  our consolidated net worth will continue to decline 
if our consolidated net worth falls below million then we would be in breach of this covenant and would need to negotiate a further amendment or waiver to use this line of credit 
there can be no assurance that our bank would agree to such an amendment or waiver 
the march amendment letter did not alter the interest covenant 
based upon the interest rate as at december  the covenant that our interest expense on the loan does not exceed  british pounds in any one fiscal quarter does not restrict our ability to use this facility 
at december   our cash obligations and commitments relating to our debt obligations and lease payments were as follows total less than year to years to years greater than years bank loan capital lease obligations operating lease obligations with the exception of the above operating leases we have no off balance sheet financing activities 
our cash balance of million combined with cash generated by operations will be our primary source of liquidity 
we repaid our outstanding term loan in january  which used million of this cash balance 
during the next months  we may use all  or a substantial part of our cash balance to fund our current obligations and our operations 
the amount of cash reserves that we will use to fund our operations will depend on our ability to grow our revenue or reduce our operating expenses 
we also have available the facility through june subject to remaining compliant with the financial covenants as discussed above 
we will continue to rely on our cash resources to fund operations  but management believes that the current cash balances  the availability of loans under the facility  our forecasts for revenue in fiscal and potential cost reduction efforts  will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next months 
in the event that loans under our credit facility are not available  or increases in revenues do not materialize  we would need to rely more heavily on cost reduction efforts to maintain sufficient cash to operate the business 
in order to further strengthen our cash position  we may seek to raise additional debt or equity financing 

table of contents risk factors the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and unpredictable  which affect our revenue  gross margin and results of operations 
we are subject to the global semiconductor industry s business cycles  the timing  length and volatility of which are difficult to predict 
the semiconductor industry has historically been cyclical because of sudden changes in demand for semiconductors and manufacturing capacity  including capacity utilizing the latest technology 
these fluctuations in demand have affected the timing and amounts of customers capital equipment purchases and investments in new technology  and continue to affect our revenue  gross margin and results of operations 
in addition to affecting our customers and suppliers  these business cycles also challenge our key management  engineering and other employees 
during periods of increasing demand for semiconductor manufacturing equipment  we must have sufficient manufacturing capacity and inventory to meet customer demand  and must be able to attract  hire  assimilate and retain a sufficient number of qualified individuals 
the semiconductor industry appears to be in the early stages of an upturn 
however  we cannot predict the sustainability of a recovery  if any  and or the industry s rate of growth in such a recovery  and our ability to take advantage of the upturn if it continues 
as at december  we have not significantly benefited from the early stage of the upturn 
if we are unable to effectively manage our resources and production capacity during an industry upturn  there could be a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
conversely  in downturns  we must be able to appropriately align our cost structure with prevailing market conditions and effectively motivate and retain key employees 
in response to the downturn that began in fiscal  we reduced our cost structure as appropriate  however we continued our research and development  customer support and sales and marketing at levels that resulted in operating losses for fiscal and we believe these levels of expenditure are necessary to compete in this market 
if we are unable to take advantage of a cyclical upturn  or the upturn does not materialize we would continue to incur losses and may be required to reduce our cost structure significantly  such that it would harm our ability to continue to operate in the global semiconductor market place 
we are exposed to risks associated with a highly concentrated customer base 
our customer base is  and has been  highly concentrated and our orders are from a relatively limited number of manufacturers of integrated circuits 
this may lead to customers to demand from us less favorable pricing and other terms 
in addition  sales to any single customer may vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
if current customers delay  cancel or do not place orders we may not be able to replace these orders with new orders 
as our products are configured to customer specifications  changing  rescheduling or canceling orders may result in significant and often non recoverable costs 
the resulting fluctuations in the amount of and terms of orders could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we will not be able to compete effectively if we fail to address the rapid technological change in the semiconductor industry 
the semiconductor industry and the semiconductor equipment industry are subject to rapid technological change and frequent introductions of enhancements to existing products  and if we are unable to develop and incorporate new technologies in our products  we will be unable to compete effectively and our business will be materially and adversely affected 
technological trends have had and will continue to have a significant impact on our business 
our results of operations and ability to remain competitive are largely based upon our ability to accurately anticipate customer and market requirements 
accordingly  we may be required to maintain a relatively high level of research and development spending  even at time of declining sales and profitability  in order to maintain our competitive position 

table of contents our success in developing  introducing and selling new and enhanced products depends upon a variety of factors  including timely and efficient completion of product design and development  timely and efficient implementation of manufacturing and assembly processes  effective sales and marketing  product performance in the field  and product support and service 
we may not be able to accurately forecast or respond to commercial and technical trends in the semiconductor industry or respond to specific product announcements by our competitors 
our competitors may be developing technologies and products that are more effective or that achieve more widespread acceptance 
in addition  we may incur substantial costs to ensure the functionality and reliability of our current and future products 
if our products are unreliable or do not meet our customers expectations  then reduced orders  higher manufacturing costs  delays in collecting accounts receivable or additional service and warranty expense could result 
our customers may purchase equipment for their new products but experience delays and technical and manufacturing difficulties in their introductions or transition to volume production using our systems causing significant delays between the sale of an initial tool into our customers development facility and potential follow on sales for manufacturing 
any of these events could negatively affect our ability to generate the return we expect to achieve on our investments in these new products 
we expect the semiconductor industry to further migrate to the use of copper and will need to continue to adapt our products for use with copper and copper processes 
if we fail to make our products compatible with copper and copper processes at the time our competitors offer copper compatible products  our revenues and market share will be negatively affected 
the semiconductor industry also has historically moved to larger diameter wafers requiring new equipment as a strategy to reduce manufacturing costs 
the maximum diameter of silicon wafers used in production is increasing from mm to mm 
while we have already shipped mm systems for our cvd products  we continue to develop the technology and solutions for our pvd and etch systems 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will be able to complete the development of mm systems for our pvd and etch systems in time to meet market demand 
if our current products and our mm systems for our pvd and etch systems are not competitive or available at the correct time  we may lose customers or fail to gain new business from potential customers  which would have a material adverse effect on our revenues and net earnings 
we believe that our technology for the deposition of low k dielectrics is advanced compared to our competitors and we are dedicating significant resources to continue to lead in this field and to achieve the commercial sales of our low k systems 
however  the physical characteristics of low k films make the manufacturing process significantly more difficult than with existing insulating materials and  as a result  device manufacturers have been slow to adopt the use of low k materials and this adoption has been delayed during the current downturn 
device manufacturers continue to find alternative methods to manufacture devices at smaller feature sizes  and forgo the development and use of low k materials 
also  there can be no assurance that the industry will adopt a cvd method for the deposition of low k films 
other technologies for which we do not manufacture equipment could also be used for the deposition of low k films 
if we fail to continue to develop our low k cvd solution to achieve all the specifications required by device manufacturers  or our competitors develop competing low k solutions  then our ability to grow our revenues and market share from these products would be negatively affected 
our operational results could be negatively affected by currency fluctuations 
we are based in the united kingdom  and most of our operating expenses are incurred in british pounds 
our revenues  however  are generally denominated in us dollars  and to a lesser extent in euros  and we report 
table of contents our financial results in us dollars 
accordingly  if the british pound increases in value against the us dollar  our expenses as a percentage of revenues will increase and gross margins and net income will be negatively affected 
the semiconductor industry is global and is expanding within the asian region 
if we are unable to penetrate this market our ability to grow our revenues will be restricted 
the percentage of worldwide semiconductor production that is based in the asian region is growing  particularly within china 
our business has traditionally been strongest with the european semiconductor manufacturers and we have only a small installed base and limited brand recognition in asia 
it will be necessary for us to penetrate new customers in this region to grow our business and while we have appointed a new sales representative in this region and hired a small number of employees there is no assurance that we will be able to penetrate these geographic markets which are subject to growth rates that are higher than worldwide growth rates 
our competitors have greater financial resources and greater name recognition than we do and therefore may compete more successfully 
we face competition or potential competition from many companies with greater resources than ours 
if we are unable to compete effectively with these companies  our market share may decline and our business could be harmed 
virtually all of our primary competitors are substantially larger companies and some of them have broader product lines than ours 
they have well established reputations in the markets in which we compete  greater experience with high volume manufacturing  broader name recognition  substantially larger customer bases  and substantially greater financial  technical  manufacturing and marketing resources than we do 
we also face potential competition from new entrants  including established manufacturers in other segments of the semiconductor capital equipment market who may decide to diversify into our market segments of cvd  pvd and plasma etch 
semiconductor manufacturers are loyal to their current semiconductor equipment supplier  which may make it difficult for us to obtain new customers 
we believe that once a semiconductor manufacturer has selected a supplier s equipment for a particular fabrication line  the manufacturer often will continue to rely on that supplier s equipment for future requirements  including new generations of similar products 
if we are unable to sell our products to potential customers who currently are using other suppliers equipment  it could be difficult for us to increase our revenues or market share 
changing from one equipment supplier to another may be expensive and may require a substantial investment of resources by the customer 
accordingly  we may experience difficulty in achieving significant sales to a customer using another supplier s equipment 
at the same time  however  we cannot make assurances that our existing customers will continue to use our equipment in the future 
our products generally have long sales cycles and implementation periods  which increase our costs of obtaining orders and reduce the predictability of our earnings 
our products are technologically complex 
prospective customers generally must commit significant resources to test and evaluate our products and to install and integrate them into larger systems 
in addition  customers often require a significant number of product presentations and demonstrations  in some instances evaluating equipment on site  before reaching a sufficient level of confidence in the product s performance and compatibility with their requirements to place an order 
as a result  our sales process is often subject to delays associated with lengthy approval processes that typically accompany the design and testing of new products 
the sales cycles of our products often last for many months or even years 
longer sales cycles require us to invest significant resources in attempting to make sales and delay the generation of revenue 
in addition  we may incur significant costs in supporting evaluation equipment at our customers facilities 

table of contents long sales cycles also subject us to other risks  including customers budgetary constraints  internal acceptance reviews and cancellations 
in addition  orders expected in one quarter could shift to another because of the timing of customers purchase decisions 
the time required for our customers to incorporate our products into their manufacturing processes can vary significantly with the needs of our customers and generally exceeds several months  which further complicates our planning processes and reduces the predictability of our operating results 
we depend upon sole suppliers for certain key components 
we depend on a number of sole suppliers for key components used in the manufacture of our products 
if we are unable to obtain timely delivery of sufficient quantities of these components  we would be unable to manufacture our products to meet customer demand  unless we are able to locate replacement components 
most significantly  our cluster tools are designed around an automation module supplied by brooks automation 
due to the high cost of these modules we keep very few in inventory 
if brooks automation fails to deliver the component on a timely basis  delivery of our cluster tools will be delayed and sales may be lost 
if brooks automation is unable to deliver any such modules for a prolonged period of time  we will have to redesign our cluster tools so that we may utilize other wafer transport systems 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so  or that customers will adopt the redesigned systems 
our final assembly and testing is concentrated in one facility 
our final assembly and testing activity is concentrated in our facility in newport  united kingdom 
we have no alternative facilities to allow for continued production if we are required to cease production in our facility  as a result of a fire  natural disaster or otherwise 
in such event  we will be unable to produce any products until the facility is replaced 
any such interruption in our manufacturing schedule could cause us to lose sales and customers 
if we are unable to hire and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel  our ability to manage growth will be negatively affected 
our business and future operating results depend in part upon our ability to attract and retain qualified management  technical  sales and support personnel for our operations on a worldwide basis 
competition for qualified personnel is intense  and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel 
our operations could be negatively affected if we lose key executives or employees or are unable to attract and retain skilled executives and employees as needed 
our ability to compete could be jeopardized if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights from challenges by third parties 
our success and ability to compete depend in large part upon protecting our proprietary technology 
we rely on a combination of patent  trade secret  copyright and trademark laws  non disclosure and other contractual agreements and technical measures to protect our proprietary rights 
there can be no assurance that patents will be issued on our pending patent applications or that competitors will not be able to ascertain legitimately proprietary information embedded in our products that is not covered by patent or copyright 
in such case  we may be precluded from preventing the competitor from making use of such information 
in addition  should we wish to assert our patent rights against a particular competitor s product  there can be no assurance that any claim in any of our patents will be sufficiently broad nor  if sufficiently broad  any assurance that our patent will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  or that we will have sufficient resources to prosecute our rights 

table of contents claims or litigation regarding intellectual property rights could seriously harm our business or require us to incur significant costs 
in recent years  there has been significant litigation in the united states in the semiconductor equipment industry involving patents and other intellectual property rights 
infringement claims may be asserted against us in the future and  if such claims are made  we may not be able to defend against such claims successfully or  if necessary  obtain licenses on reasonable terms 
any claim that our products infringe proprietary rights of others would force us to defend ourselves and possibly our customers against the alleged infringement 
these claims and any resulting lawsuit  if successful  could subject us to significant liability for damages and invalidation of our proprietary rights 
these lawsuits  regardless of their outcome  would likely be time consuming and expensive to resolve and would divert management time and attention 
any potential intellectual property litigation could force us to do one or more of the following lose or forfeit our proprietary rights  stop manufacturing or selling our products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property  obtain from the owner of the infringed intellectual property right a license to sell or use the relevant technology  which license may not be available on reasonable terms or at all and may involve significant royalty payments  pay damages  including treble damages and attorney s fees in some circumstances  or redesign those products that use the challenged intellectual property 
if we are forced to take any of the foregoing actions  our business could be severely harmed 
our operations are subject to health and safety and environmental laws that may expose us to liabilities for noncompliance 
we are subject to a variety of governmental regulations relating to the use  storage  discharge  handling  manufacture and disposal of all materials present at  or our output from  our facilities  including the toxic or other hazardous chemical by products of our manufacturing processes 
environmental claims against us  or our failure to comply with any present or future regulations could result in the assessment of damages or imposition of fines against us  the suspension of production of our products  or the cessation of our operations 
new regulations could require us to purchase costly equipment or to incur other significant expenses 
our failure to control the use or adequately restrict the discharge of hazardous substances could subject us to future liabilities  which could negatively affect our earnings and financial position 
any acquisitions we may make could disrupt our business and severely harm our financial condition 
from time to time  we may consider investments in complementary companies  products or technologies 
in the event of any future acquisitions  we could issue stock that would dilute our current stockholders percentage ownership  incur debt  assume liabilities  incur amortization expenses related to tangible assets and other intangible assets  or incur large and immediate accounting write offs 

table of contents our operation of any acquired business will also involve numerous risks  including problems integrating the purchased operations  technologies or products  unanticipated costs and liabilities for which we are not able to obtain indemnification from the sellers  diversion of management s attention from our core business  adverse effects on existing business relationships with customers  risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience  and potential loss of key employees  particularly those of the purchased organizations 
you may have difficulty protecting your rights as a stockholder and in enforcing civil liabilities because many of our executive officers and the majority of the members of our board of directors and the majority of our assets are located outside the united states 
our principal assets and manufacturing plants are located in the united kingdom 
in addition  most of the members of our board of directors and our executive officers are residents of jurisdictions other than the united states 
as a result  it may be difficult for stockholders to serve process within the united states upon members of our board of directors and our executive officers  or to enforce against us or members of our board of directors or our executive officers judgments of the us courts  to enforce outside the united states judgments obtained against members of our board of directors or our executive officers in us courts  or to enforce in us courts judgments obtained against members of our board of directors or our executive officers in courts in jurisdictions outside the united states  in any action  including actions that derive from the civil liability provisions of the us securities laws 
in addition  it may be difficult for our stockholders to enforce  in original actions brought in courts in jurisdictions located outside the united states  liabilities that derive from us securities laws 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our earnings and cash flow are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
significant factors affecting this risk include our manufacturing  research and development and administrative cost base  which are predominately incurred in british pounds  and product sales outside the united states  which may be expressed in currencies other than the united states dollar 
we constantly monitor currency exchange rates and match currency availability and requirements whenever possible 
we may from time to time enter into forward foreign exchange transactions in order to minimize risk from firm future positions arising from trading 
as at december  and december  we did not have any open forward currency transactions 
based upon budgeted income and expenditures  a hypothetical increase of in the value of the british pound against all other currencies in the year ended december  would have no material effect on revenues  which are primarily expressed in united states dollars and would increase operating costs and reduce cash flow by approximately million 
the same increase in the value of the british pound would increase the value of the net assets of we expressed in united states dollars by approximately million 
we have also received orders for revenue that are denominated in euros  therefore an increase in the value of the euro in relation to the united states dollar would effect the reported value of revenue 
the effect of the hypothetical change in exchange rates ignores the effect this movement may have on other variables including competitive risk 
if it were possible to quantify this impact  the results could well be different from the sensitivity effects shown above 
in addition  it is unlikely that all currencies would uniformly strengthen or weaken relative to the british pound 
in reality  some currencies may weaken while others may strengthen
