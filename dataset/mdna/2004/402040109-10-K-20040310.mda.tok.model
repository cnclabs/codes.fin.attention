item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general guitar center is the nation s leading retailer of guitars  amplifiers  percussion instruments  keyboards and pro audio and recording equipment based on annual revenue 
as of december   we operated guitar center stores  with stores in major markets and stores in secondary markets 
in addition  our american music division operates family music stores specializing in band and orchestral instruments for sale and rental  serving teachers  band directors  college professors and students 
we are also the largest direct response retailer of musical instruments in the united states through our wholly owned subsidiary  musician s friend  inc  and its catalog and web site  www 
musiciansfriend 
com 
during  we opened new stores and relocated one store which resulted in the addition of approximately  square feet of store space 
the new store opening program for included nine large format guitar center stores  of which two were large flagship stores located in manhattan and nashville  and five small format stores 
in the five year period from the beginning of to the end of  we have grown from guitar center stores to guitar center stores  consisting of large flagship stores in hollywood  manhattan and nashville  other large format stores and small format stores 
total square footage grew from  square feet at the beginning of to  square feet at the end of as we enter new markets  we expect that we will initially incur higher administrative and promotional costs per store than is currently experienced in established markets 
we expect competition to continue to increase as other music product retailers attempt to execute national growth strategies 
our business strategy will also emphasize opportunities to continue to grow each of our brands  including further acquisitions if attractive candidates can be located for reasonable prices 
from to  our net sales grew at an annual compound growth rate of  principally due to the comparable store sales growth of our retail stores averaging per year  the opening of new stores  and a per year increase in the direct response channel 
we believe such volume increases are the result of the continued success of the implementation of our business strategy  continued growth in the music products industry and increasing consumer awareness of the guitar center  musician s friend and american music brand names 
we achieved comparable store sales growth of   and for the fiscal years ended december   and  respectively 
we believe this growth reflects the strength of our merchandise selection  effective advertising and promotion  and well trained and committed personnel 
executive summary during  our guitar center stores generated comparative store sales growth and a increase in total net sales 
sales from new stores contributed million and accounted for of the sales increase in our guitar center stores 
late in the year we increased our advertising expenditure  predominately focused on generating a greater number of impressions through our mailing list  which resulted in higher traffic in our stores 
we continue to encounter operational challenges in our american music stores 
the results of american music continue to reflect investments in the systems and infrastructure for the stores 
despite the challenges we are experiencing in this business  we generated an increase of in net sales and achieved comparable store sales for the year 
we are repositioning our american music stores and establishing scalable infrastructure and systems for this area of our business 
we have slowed our planned growth of the american music division because of the challenges posed by our infrastructure and remerchandising projects 
as a result of these factors  the american music stores incurred significant operating losses in failure to execute on the requirements and initiatives described above could potentially require us to recognize an impairment in the significant amount of goodwill recorded in the acquisitions of american music and m m music  which totaled million at december  no such impairment has been recorded through december  our direct response division generated a increase in net sales and an increase in operating income 
for the year  we achieved an initial order fill rate of and improved inventory turn to times on a trailing twelve month basis compared to times in our return rate as a percentage of sales was in compared to in the improvements that were made to the musician s friend web site over the last year  as well as to the infrastructure and systems at the direct response call center and fulfillment center  permitted us to capitalize on high demand 
during the fourth quarter  the direct response division changed its revenue recognition methodology  whereby we do not recognize revenue until the estimated date an order is received by the customer  instead of the date shipped 
this change resulted in a reduction of approximately million in net sales  and of approximately  in net income  or per diluted share  for the fourth quarter 
the impact of this change was immaterial to the prior quarters of the net effect of the change was to take several days sales at the end of december and defer recognition of that revenue to on a going forward basis  we do not expect this change to have a material effect on operating results because the amount of revenue deferred at the end of a given quarter should be largely offset by revenue carried over from the prior period 
we are focused on leveraging the infrastructure investments we have made to streamline inventory management and improve operating efficiencies across the company 
continued execution of these initiatives will be necessary to meet our business objectives for discussion of critical accounting policies in the ordinary course of business  we have made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of results of operations and financial condition in the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
additionally  the policy described below regarding credits and other vendor allowances is unique to our industry and deserves the attention of a reader of our financial statements 
valuation of inventory we value our inventories at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out fifo method 
rental inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using the specific identification method and are depreciated on a straight line basis over the term of the associated rental agreement for rent to own sales  or over the estimated useful life of the rented instrument for rental only items 
we record adjustments to the value of inventory based upon obsolescence and changes in market value 
applicable costs associated with bringing inventory through our guitar center retail distribution center are capitalized to inventory 
the amounts are expensed to cost of goods sold as the associated inventory is sold 
management has evaluated the current level of inventories considering future customer demand for our products  taking into account general economic conditions  growth prospects within the marketplace  competition  market acceptance of current and upcoming products  and management initiatives 
based on this evaluation  we have recorded impairment adjustments to cost of goods sold for estimated decreases in net realizable value 
these judgments are made in the context of our customers shifting needs  product and technological trends  and changes in the demographic mix of our customers 
a misinterpretation or misunderstanding of these conditions and uncertainties in the future outlook of our industry or the economy  or other failure to estimate correctly  could result in inventory valuation changes as of any given balance sheet date 
valuation of long lived assets long lived assets such as property and equipment and identifiable intangibles are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
goodwill is required to be reviewed for impairment on an annual basis  or more frequently when triggering events occur 
factors we consider important  which could trigger impairment  include  among other things significant underperformance relative to historical or projected operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy of our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  and significant decline in stock value for a sustained period 
for long lived assets other than goodwill and intangibles that are not amortized  the determination of whether impairment has occurred is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the assets  as compared to the carrying value of the assets 
assumptions used in these cash flows are consistent with internal forecasts and consider current and future expected sales volumes and related operating costs and any anticipated increases or declines based on expected market conditions and local business environment factors 
if a potential impairment is identified  the amount of the impairment loss recognized would be determined by estimating the fair value of the assets and recording a loss if the fair value was less than the book value 
fair value will be determined based on appraisal values assessed by third parties  if deemed necessary  or a discounted future cash flows analysis 
for goodwill and other intangibles that are not amortized  impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the related assets of the underlying segment to which the goodwill relates 
our assessment regarding the existence of impairment factors is based on market conditions and the operational performance of our business 
our review of factors present and the resulting appropriate carrying value of our goodwill  intangibles and other long lived assets are subject to judgments and estimates that management is required to make 
sales returns as part of our satisfaction guaranteed policy  we allow guitar center customers to return product generally within days after the date of purchase  and we allow musician s friend customers to return product within days 
american music customers have ten business days from the date of purchase to return product 
we regularly review and revise  when deemed necessary  our estimates of sales returns based upon historical trends 
while our estimates during the past few years have closely approximated actual results  actual returns may differ significantly  either favorably or unfavorably  from estimates if factors such as economic conditions or the competitive environment differ from our expectations 
credits and other vendor allowances we receive cooperative advertising allowances ie  an allowance from the manufacturer to subsidize qualifying advertising and similar promotional expenditures we make relating to the vendor s products  price protection credits ie  credits from vendors with respect to in stock inventory if the vendor subsequently lowers their wholesale price for such products and vendor rebates ie  credits or rebates provided by vendors based on the purchase of specified products and paid at a later date 
cooperative advertising allowances are recognized as a reduction to selling  general  and administrative expense when we incur the advertising expense eligible for the credit 
we recognized cooperative advertising allowances of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  recorded as an offset to selling  general and administrative expense 
price protection credits and vendor rebates are accounted for as a reduction of the cost of merchandise inventory and are recorded at the time the credit or rebate is earned 
the effect of price protection credits and vendor rebates is recognized in the income statement at the time the related inventory is sold  as a reduction in cost of goods sold 
none of these credits are recorded as revenue 
results of operations the following table presents our consolidated statements of income  as a percentage of sales  for the periods indicated fiscal year ended december  net sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses operating income other expense write off of investment in non consolidated entity interest expense  net total other expense income before income taxes income taxes net income fiscal compared to fiscal net sales for the year ended december  increased to billion  compared with billion last year 
comparable store sales for the full year increased 
comparable store sales are defined as sales for the comparable periods  excluding net sales attributable to stores not open for months as of the end of the reporting period 
we believe that comparable store sales are a more useful indicator of store performance than the change in total net sales  since comparable store sales exclude the effects of changes in the number of stores open 
net sales from guitar center stores for fiscal totaled million  a increase from million in fiscal sales from new stores contributed million and represent of the total increase in retail store sales 
comparable guitar center store sales for the full year increased

net sales from american music stores for totaled million  a increase from million in comparable american music stores sales for the full year increased

sales from the contact center  which represents sales placed via phone  live chat  mail and e mail  increased to million from million in internet sales from orders placed via musician s friend and giardinelli web sites increased to million from million for the same period last year 
the growth of web based sales reflects the continued trend of our catalog customers preference in using the web to place their orders  the success of web based promotions  and that the web site includes a more complete inventory presentation than our catalogs 
during the fourth quarter  the direct response division changed its revenue recognition methodology  whereby we do not recognize revenue until the estimated date an order is received by the customer  instead of the date shipped 
this change resulted in a reduction of approximately million in net sales  and of approximately  in net income  or per diluted share  for the fourth quarter 
the impact of this change was immaterial to the prior quarters of on a going forward basis  we do not expect this change to have a material effect on operating results because the amount of revenue deferred at the end of a given quarter should be largely offset by revenue carried over from the prior period

one of our competitors  mars music  inc  filed for federal bankruptcy court protection on september  and has completed a liquidation resulting in the closure of all of its stores

fiscal compared to fiscal net sales for the year ended december  increased to billion  compared with million last year 
comparable store sales for the full year increased 
comparable store sales are defined as sales for the comparable periods  excluding net sales attributable to stores not open for months as of the end of the reporting period

net sales from the direct response channel totaled million in  a million  or  increase from  due primarily to increased orders driven by higher circulation and promotional targeting and an increase in the average order 
although catalogs are mailed to both internet and catalog customers  we continue to see a shifting in customer preference towards placing orders via the internet 
catalog sales  which consist of all orders placed through the contact center  increased to million in from million in internet sales for the year  which represents orders placed via the internet  increased to million from million last year 
during the second quarter of  we adopted a new accounting policy to conform with eitf  accounting for shipping and handling fees and costs 
prior to adopting eitf  shipping and handling fees paid by our customers to our direct response division were recognized as a reduction to cost of goods sold 
to conform with eitf  we now treat such fees as revenue 
as a result  million and million of shipping and handling fees were recognized as direct response division revenue in the years and  respectively 
the reclassification of these fees has no effect on operating income  net income or earnings per share for any period 
we have made a conforming reclassification in all historical accounting periods to provide a comparable presentation

on july  and july  holders may at their election require us to purchase all of the notes at of the principal amount  plus any accrued interest  including contingent interest 
final maturity of the notes is july  our revolving line of credit provides for a maximum facility of million  subject to borrowing base limitations  and expires in december we had no borrowings under our credit facility at december  we may need to renegotiate our credit facility prior to the expiration date depending on our future capital needs  our working capital base and alternative sources of financing available 
operating lease commitments consist principally of real property leases for our corporate offices  retail store facilities and distribution centers 
these leases frequently include options which permit us to extend the terms beyond the initial fixed lease term 
we also have rented personal property through operating leases 
payments for these lease commitments are provided for by cash flows generated from operations 
please see note to the consolidated financial statements 
other long term liabilities consist of our outstanding standby letters of credit at december  our need for liquidity will arise primarily from the funding of capital expenditures  working capital requirements and payments on our indebtedness  as well as possible acquisitions 
we have historically financed our operations primarily through internally generated funds and borrowings under our credit facilities 
please see item business risks related to the business for a discussion of factors which could reasonably likely result in a decrease in the amount of internally generated funds available to finance capital expenditures and working capital requirements 
as of december   we had no borrowings under our credit facility and had available borrowings of million net of million of outstanding letters of credit 
the terms of our significant financing agreements  including those related to our credit facility  the convertible notes and the equipment lease facilities described below are not dependent on any change in our credit rating 
we believe that the key company specific factors affecting our ability to maintain our existing debt and lease financing relationships and to access such capital in the future are our present and expected levels of profitability and cash flow from operations  our working capital and fixed asset collateral bases  our expected level of capital expenditures  the level of equity capital of the company relative to the level of debt obligations and  in the case of convertible instruments  the related perceived attractiveness of an investment in our common stock 
in addition  as noted below  our existing agreements include significant restrictions on future financings  including  among others  limits on the amount of indebtedness that we may incur and whether or not such indebtedness may be secured by any of our assets 
in the fourth quarter of  we amended our credit facility with a syndicate of banks led by wells fargo retail finance 
the credit facility permits borrowings up to million  subject to borrowing base limitations million at december  
the actual amount available is tied to our inventory and receivable base  and repayment obligations under the credit facility are secured by liens on our principal assets 
borrowing options are prime rate at december  plus applicable prime margin  or london interbank offered rate  or libor six month rate at december  was plus applicable libor margin 
the applicable prime and libor margins are fixed for the first six months of the agreement at and  respectively

if excess availability is greater than million  the applicable prime margin is and applicable libor margin is 
if excess availability is less than or equal to million and greater than million  the applicable prime margin is and the applicable libor margin is 
if excess availability is less than or equal to million  the applicable prime margin is and the applicable libor margin is 
an unused fee is assessed on the unused portion of the credit facility based upon levels of excess availability 
if excess availability is greater than million  the unused fee is 
if excess availability is less than or equal to million  the unused fee is 
the agreement underlying the credit facility includes significant restrictive negative covenants 
among other things  these covenants restrict our ability to incur debt and issue specified equity instruments  incur liens on our assets  make any significant change in our corporate structure or the nature of our business  dispose of assets  make guaranties  prepay debt  engage in a change in control transaction  pay dividends  make investments or acquisitions  engage in transactions with affiliates and incur capital expenditures  and also require that we satisfy a minimum availability test 
the minimum availability test requires that we maintain million of reserved availability under the agreement based on its borrowing base limitations 
the amount we disclose in our public reports from time to time as available to borrow under the agreement million at december  is already reduced by this required reserve and outstanding letters of credit  and thus represents a net amount available under the agreement 
the agreement also includes representations and warranties which must be true each time we borrow funds under the credit facility and affirmative covenants 
the full text of the contractual requirements imposed by this financing is set forth in the amended and restated loan and security agreement which has been filed with the securities and exchange commission 
we were in compliance with such requirements as of december  subject to limited cure periods  the lenders under our credit facility may demand repayment of these borrowings prior to stated maturity upon the occurrence of specified events  including if we breach the terms of the agreement  suffer a material adverse change  engage in a change in control transaction  suffer a significant adverse legal judgment  default on other significant obligations  or in the event of specified events of insolvency 
the credit agreement matures in december on june   we completed the issuance of million principal amount of senior convertible notes due of the net proceeds from the offering  approximately million was used in july to retire all outstanding senior notes and pay the related redemption premium  and the balance was used to reduce the amount outstanding under our credit agreement and pay offering expenses 
the notes bear interest at the rate of per annum  subject to the payment of contingent interest under certain circumstances  and are convertible into shares of common stock at a conversion price of per share  subject to adjustment under specified circumstances 
under the contingent conversion feature of the notes  subject to certain exceptions  they are not convertible into common stock unless and until the trading price of the common stock reaches at least for a specified period or designated corporate events occur 
the final maturity of the notes is july  although holders may require us to repurchase the notes at their election in july  july or upon the occurrence of a change in control  in each case for a purchase price equal to the original principal amount plus accrued interest 
we may call the notes for redemption commencing in july subject to the payment of a redemption premium of if redeemed prior to july and if redeemed prior to july thereafter there is no redemption premium 
the indenture governing the notes does not limit our ability to incur indebtedness or otherwise substantively restrict the operation of our business to any significant degree 
subject to limited cure periods  the holders of the notes may demand repayment of these borrowings prior to the stated maturity upon the occurrence of specified events  including if we fail to pay interest or principal when due  fail to satisfy our conversion obligation  if another obligation of ours having an outstanding principal amount in excess of million is accelerated prior to stated maturity and upon the occurrence of specified events of insolvency 
in july  we called for the redemption of million of senior notes outstanding 
interest expense related to the redemption premium and the write off of deferred financing costs associated with the senior notes redeemed was million million after tax  or per diluted share 
during we entered into master operating lease agreements with general electric capital corporation and us bank to lease equipment and other property primarily to support the operations of the new central distribution center for our guitar center retail stores 
under these agreements  we leased a total of million in equipment and other property 
the agreement calls for monthly payments of  for a term of months through september  and monthly payments of  for a term of months through december  the leases have options to extend through september  and december   respectively 
as is the case with most multi unit retailers  substantially all of the real property used in our business is leased under operating lease agreements 
please see  item properties  disclosures about contractual obligations and commercial commitments and note to our financial statements 
for the year ended december   cash provided by operating activities was million  most of which represented cash income from operations  net of depreciation and amortization expense 
cash used in investing activities totaled million  which primarily consisted of capital expenditures for retail store expansions million  remodeling of existing stores million and computer equipment purchases million 
cash used in financing activities totaled million  which consisted principally of repayments under our credit facility million and redemption of our senior notes outstanding million  offset by net proceeds from the issuance of our million senior convertible notes  less fees of million million and the proceeds from employee stock purchases and the exercise of stock options million 
our principal working capital need is to provide for the inventory levels necessary to support our sales activities  particularly the guitar center retail stores 
inventory decreased from million to million  or 
inventory per square foot at guitar center retail stores guitar center store and distribution center inventories under gaap divided by total store retail square footage on a given date was at december  compared to in our ongoing objective is to improve inventory performance by refining our replenishment processes and systems  utilizing a distribution center for our guitar center stores  and through improved planning  presentation and display of inventories in our retail stores 
we generally do not provide credit to our retail customers but instead offer programs provided by third party consumer credit companies which are non recourse to us  meaning that the risk of non payment is borne by the third party provider so long as we comply with its administrative and approval policies 
from time to time we participate in programs that provide our customers with below market interest rates  deferred payments or similar benefits 
these programs are also non recourse to us but we pay the credit provider a fee which is recognized as a component of selling  general and administrative expense at the time of the sale to the consumer 
we intend to pursue an aggressive growth strategy by opening additional stores in new and existing markets 
during  we opened new guitar center stores 
each new large format guitar center store typically has required approximately to million for gross inventory 
historically  our cost of capital improvements for a large format guitar center store has been approximately  consisting of leasehold improvements  fixtures and equipment 
we incur higher costs in some geographic areas  particularly the northeast  and when we build a larger flagship store 
we have developed smaller guitar center stores to build in secondary markets or sites that we do not believe will support our large format units 
the first of these units was opened in late and more had been opened as of december  our small format stores have typically incurred approximately  in capital expenditures and require approximately million to million in inventory 
we are also anticipating additional capital and strategic requirements related to improving our fulfillment facilities  upgrading our technology and systems  and pursuing new opportunities in the e commerce activities of our retail and direct response divisions as well as related businesses 
our distribution center in the indianapolis  indiana area supports our guitar center retail store operations 
we have a year agreement to lease the facility and we also have numerous additional commitments necessary to support the operations of the facility 
in  nearly all products flowed through the distribution facility  with the exception of special orders which will continue  for the most part  to be drop shipped to our stores 
migration from our former drop ship model to a centralized distribution model is an important development in our operating strategy and has required the allocation of significant financial and managerial resources 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  a portion of the costs of operating this facility are absorbed into our guitar center merchandise inventories and recognized as an element of cost of goods sold when the related inventory is sold 
this can result in a slight decrease in reported gross margin depending on our success in defraying these additional costs  although we also expect to realize efficiencies involving other costs such as selling  general and administrative expense and interest expense 
we also continue to make significant investments in information technology across our businesses and to incur costs and make investments designed to expand the reach of our businesses on the internet 
the costs of these initiatives and other investments related to our businesses will continue to be significant 
our expansion strategy is to continue to increase our market share in existing markets and to penetrate strategically selected new markets 
we opened a total of guitar center stores in and stores in  and currently anticipate opening to guitar center stores in approximately half of the stores planned for are smaller format units designed for secondary markets 
we opened a total of eight american music stores in  five of the eight by acquisition of m m music  a band instrument and retail merchandise retailer 
in  we opened one and closed two american music stores 
as of december   we have american music stores 
in  we do not presently plan to open any american music stores 
we have slowed our planned growth of the american music division because our infrastructure and remerchandising projects at this business have to date required more time and resources than originally anticipated 
we do  however  believe there exists a number of acquisition opportunities in the relatively fragmented band instruments market that could be a good fit into our american music platform and continue to pursue acquisition opportunities 
we also believe there may be attractive opportunities to expand by selectively acquiring existing music products retailers or other complimentary businesses  if attractive opportunities can be identified 
while we cannot provide assurance that we will complete any further acquisition transactions  in the ordinary course of our business we investigate and engage in negotiations regarding such opportunities 
acquisitions will be financed with drawings under our existing credit facilities  expansion of our credit facilities  issuance of debt or equity securities  or a combination  depending upon transaction size and market conditions  among other things 
our additional capital resources and liquidity for are presently expected to be primarily provided by net cash flow from operations and borrowings under our credit facility 
depending upon market conditions  we may also elect or be required to raise additional capital in the form of common or preferred equity  debt or convertible securities for the purpose of providing additional capital to fund working capital needs or continued growth of our existing business  or to refinance existing obligations 
any such financing activity will be dependent upon many factors  including our liquidity needs  market conditions and prevailing market terms  and we cannot assure you that future external financing for us will be available on attractive terms or at all
