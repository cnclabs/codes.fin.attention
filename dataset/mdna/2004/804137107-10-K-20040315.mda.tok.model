about management s discussion in december the sec released guidance regarding management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion has been prepared on the basis of the guidelines in the sec release 
management s discussion and analysis is designed to provide the reader of the financial statements with information that is transparent and necessary to understand the company s results of operations  financial condition and changes in financial condition 
the format of this discussion for comparing the results from operations and financial condition to has been enhanced from the format used in prior years in order to accomplish the following objectives enable investors to see the company through the eyes of management  enhance the overall financial disclosure and provide the context within which the company s financial information should be analyzed  and provide information about the quality of  and potential variability of  the company s earnings and cash flow  so that investors can assess the likelihood that past performance is indicative of future performance 
the discussion comparing results from operations to has not been reformatted 
prior period restatement the and financial statement amounts have been restated due to accounting errors identified during the closing of the west branch  iowa  operations 
the errors relate to an unreconciled account and unrecognized depreciation associated with a purchase accounting fair value adjustment related to fixed assets 
both originated in in connection with the closing of the racine  wisconsin  facility and relocation of its operations to the west branch location 
the total impact of the restatement  net of tax  over the three year period is million  or per share 
the restatement is not material to any one year and impacted only the work function segment 
refer to note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
executive summary of compared to the nature of the company s operations as a global producer and supplier in the fluid power industry means the company is impacted by changes in the local economies  including currency exchange rate fluctuations 
in order to gain a better understanding of the company s base results  a financial statement user needs to understand the impact of those currency exchange rate fluctuations as well as changes resulting from strategic acquisitions 
the following table summarizes the company s and results from operations on a comparable basis  by excluding acquisitions and the impact of currency fluctuations 
this analysis is more consistent with how the company internally evaluates its results 
in millions as reported comparable basis as reported constant dollar change percent change net sales   gross profit of sales selling  general and administrative research development loss on disposal of fixed assets nm total operating costs operating income of sales net interest expense other expense  net income before taxes and minority interest minority interest and equity income  net earnings before taxes of sales income tax benefit expense nm net income excludes acquisitions comatrol for full year and thrige electric for first quarter and the impact of currency fluctuations 
excludes results of equity ownership in comatrol 
nm percentage is not meaningful the company exceeded its own expectations in terms of sales growth by posting a percent sales growth in constant dollar terms in over this sales increase exceeded the market growth of approximately percent  which the company determined based on the volume of units sold in the regions in which the company distributes its products 
however  the margin returns on the increased sales levels in did not meet the company s expectations 
operating margins and net income margins were all lower in than in  due in part to some strategic business decisions that the company made during the year that were not originally planned  but also due to unexpected costs 
these items are discussed in more detail below 
the most significant item to impact the company s financial performance in was the decision to close and relocate two of its manufacturing locations in the us these facilities were located in sturtevant  wisconsin  and west branch  iowa 
the total costs incurred in related to the closure of these facilities amounted to million on a pretax basis 
these costs included impairment charges on property  plant and equipment  accelerated depreciation  employee severance costs  inventory disposal costs  costs to move people and equipment to other facilities  and manufacturing inefficiencies during the shut down and move of operations from these two facilities 
approximately million was recorded as loss on fixed assets 
the remaining and million affected the cost of sales and selling  general and administrative lines  respectively  of the income statement 
the company did not incur any restructuring costs in and expects to incur only million of costs related to the west branch restructuring in the company s financial results were also significantly impacted by several large field recall issues 
the field recalls amounted to a total of million on a pretax basis and impacted the gross profit line of both the propel and work function segments 
while the company was not pleased to have incurred these field recalls  they related to five individual defects that were not interrelated 
the company is diligently working to understand the root cause of these defects and to enhance its processes in order to prevent this order of magnitude of field recall costs from occurring in the future 
however  as the company has identified under its critical accounting estimates  warranty and field recall costs can be a recurring part of its business due to the high precision and technical nature of its products and processes 
there can be no assurances as to the frequency or significance of these costs in the future 
in addition to the above items  the company incurred million of expense to begin the restructuring of its sales and distribution operations in europe  which will reduce future operating costs by streamlining delivery directly from the manufacturing locations to the customer 
the company incurred million of expense to begin the implementation of a common business system to standardize business processes and provide a single interface to direct oem customers and suppliers 
the investment in the common business system will drive improved operational efficiency  customer service  and financial performance in future years 
in  the company also incurred million of outside consulting fees related to the initial work to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act of these costs are all reflected in the selling  general and administrative expenses line on the consolidated statement of income and are anticipated to continue in at varying degrees 
the items discussed above negatively impacted income from operations by million 
excluding these items  the company would have experienced a million real increase in operating income on the real sales increase of million  or approximately percent of the incremental sales growth 
the company generally targets overall margin improvement of to percent on each dollar of incremental sales based on the cost structure it has in place and the intent of reinvesting in the business for future growth 
additionally  the company experienced deterioration in gross profit margins due to the impact of the weakening us currency on product sold in the us that was manufactured outside the us see further discussion of currency risk below under market risk 
based on the ongoing operational performance  the company is not meeting these internal targets 
the company s focus going into is to deliver both top line and bottom line growth 
the company has demonstrated that it can deliver top line sales growth exceeding the market growth in the markets that it serves by achieving a percent compound annual growth rate in reported sales over the past ten years 
this growth has been achieved based on the company s strategic initiatives to grow sales through core market growth  increased product content per customer vehicle  and selective acquisitions 
going forward  more emphasis will be placed on improving profitability margins through the following strategies develop capabilities in low cost regions 
reduce time to market 
continue to pursue lean manufacturing efficiency 
reduce inefficiencies caused by excess capacity 
expand the use of six sigma quality tools 
move to more of a shared service administrative structure 
following is a discussion of the company s sales growth broken down between the various markets that the company serves and by each major region of the world 
operating results compared to sales growth by market the following table summarizes the company s sales growth by market 
the table and following discussion is on a comparable basis  which excludes acquisitions and currency fluctuations 
americas asia pacific europe total agriculture construction road building turf care specialty distribution agriculture the agriculture market increased in all regions of the world during after several years of very depressed sales volumes 
the asia pacific region  while up significantly  is off of a relatively small base compared to the rest of the world that the company serves 
of particular note is that the increase in europe was driven primarily by new projects with several large customers that began production during in the americas  the company had increased business from all of its major oems in the fourth quarter of compared to construction in the construction market  the company also experienced sales gains in all regions of the world 
the americas construction market was moderately up over  with the fourth quarter showing continued strengthening 
in europe  the increase in shipments was led by the smaller and mid sized manufacturers in this market 
in general  the outlook for this market in europe is positive for many of the company s major customers 
the asia pacific region was led by the strong transit mixer business in australia  which is expected to continue into the first half of road building the road building market was weak in the americas and europe with both being down from in the americas  this was driven primarily by a generally soft market and also by the lack of funding by state governments for highway projects 
while the market in europe was down  the outlook for is generally positive 
road building in the asia pacific region was led by many large projects in china such as preparation for the olympics in beijing  installing infrastructure for water transfer from the south of china to the north  and for national highway projects 
this increase offset the declines in both the americas and europe 
turf care the company s primary business within this market comes from products produced for the consumer and commercial turf care markets in the americas region 
consumers continue to move away from mechanical transmissions on these machines and the introduction of zero turn radius machines being sold through retail outlets is helping to continue to fuel growth in this market 
specialty vehicles sales into the specialty vehicle markets were down across all regions 
this is a trend that has been occurring for the past couple of years  primarily in the aerial lift and forklift markets 
management believes that the aerial lift market has finally stabilized in the americas and that the outlook in europe is for an upturn in the forklift market in order backlog the following table shows the company s order backlog and orders written activity  on a comparable basis  excluding acquisitions and currency fluctuations 
order backlog represents the amount of customer orders that have been received into the company s system for future shipment 
in millions comparable basis constant dollar percent change americas backlog orders written asia pacific backlog orders written europe backlog orders written total backlog orders written   total order backlog at the end of was million  compared to million at the end of  an increase of percent 
on a comparable basis  excluding the impact of currency exchange fluctuation and acquisitions  order backlog remained flat with year end levels 
new sales orders written for were  million  an increase of percent from excluding the impact of currencies and acquisitions  total orders written in were only percent above the levels 
as the company has noted in earlier communications  customers continue to adjust orders closer to the scheduled production dates  often within the scheduled shipping month 
in some cases  this is a result of the customer s uncertainty with respect to the outlook of their own markets  but it is also a sign that customers are taking advantage of reduced production cycles within the company s facilities 
in either case  the company s order and backlog information has become less reliable as an indicator of future expectations 
overall  the company has been able to achieve solid sales growth through its strategies to continue to develop new vehicle applications and to expand the content supplied for each vehicle by selling system solutions and integrating electronics with hydraulics 
business segment results the following discussion of operating results by reportable segment relates to information as presented in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
segment income is defined as the respective segment s portion of the total company s net income  excluding net interest  income taxes  minority interest  equity in net earnings of affiliates  and corporate expenses 
propel products include hydrostatic transmissions and related products that transmit the power from the engine to the wheel to propel a vehicle 
work function products include steering motors as well as gear pumps and motors that transmit power for the work functions of the vehicle 
controls products include electrohydraulic controls  microprocessors  and valves that control and direct the power of a vehicle 
the following table provides a summary of each segment s sales and segment income on a comparable basis  excluding acquisitions and currency fluctuations 
in millions change percent change net sales propel work function controls segment income loss propel work function controls global services and other expenses  net propel segment there are two primary reasons for the increase in the propel segments net sales in the first reason is the continued growth in the turf care market in the americas 
as mentioned in the preceding sales growth by market section  the move away from mechanical transmissions to hydrostatic transmissions and the zero turn radius mowers are leading the way for this growth 
the other factor of growth in the propel segment during came from the increased sales volume in the asia pacific region as china and japan experienced increased sales  primarily in the construction and road building markets as mentioned above 
the propel segment income generated on the increased sales only amounted to percent of the incremental sales over  which is considered very substandard by the company s internal standards 
during  the propel segment incurred million of field recall costs as a result of four separate quality issues at several large oem customers 
each of these instances had its own unique root cause and the company is working diligently to put the proper processes and tools in place to ensure that these types of recalls do not occur in the future 
without these field recall costs  propel segment income would have increased million  or percent of the incremental sales increase 
this is more in line with the company s internal expectations 
the propel segment income has also been impacted by increased price pressures which the company has experienced in recent years 
the propel segment is predominantly a mature product line with enhancements coming primarily from the addition of electronic controls 
consequently  customers in this market have been very aggressive in demanding price concessions 
to the extent the company concedes price reductions without offsetting these concessions with cost reductions  the price reduction negatively impacts the segment profitability 
in order to combat this impact  the propel segment is focused on utilizing global purchasing initiatives to lower part costs through sourcing components to more cost effective global suppliers and to outsource components where the company does not believe there is a manufacturing advantage 
work function segment while the work function segment experienced net sales growth over the prior year of almost million  segment income declined by million from of this decline  approximately million was a result of the company s decision during to shutdown and relocate two of its manufacturing plants in north america 
in the second and third quarters of  the company shut down its steering unit manufacturing operation in sturtevant  wisconsin  and relocated the operations to its facilities in nordborg  denmark  and wroclaw  poland 
the costs incurred for this closure  net of savings realized already during was approximately million 
during the third quarter of  the company made the decision to shut down and relocate its west branch  iowa  plant 
the majority of the costs to close and relocate this facility were incurred in and amounted to approximately million 
the majority of the manufacturing operations at west branch were transferred to the company s freeport  illinois  and lawrence  kansas  facilities 
in addition  the company successfully rationalized and outsourced certain low volume product lines that will also help to improve profitability in this segment in future periods 
the work function segment also incurred million of field recall costs due to a quality problem with one particular product at one customer 
this segment is also working to implement the proper processes and tools to prevent costs of this magnitude in the future 
controls segment the controls segment experienced sales growth that was in line with the general market trend in which the company operates 
on the positive side  the controls segment income was a very strong percent of the incremental sales growth  much higher than even the company s internal expectations 
however  the controls segment income in was negatively impacted by a million product rationalization charge 
excluding this item  the controls segment income increased percent of the incremental sales growth which still exceeded the company s internal expectations 
global services and other expenses  net the company s global services and other expenses  net segment incurs costs related to internal global service departments  along with the operating costs of the company s executive offices which were established in in lincolnshire  illinois 
worldwide services such as tax and accounting fees paid to outside third parties  certain insurance premiums  and the amortization of intangible assets from certain business combinations are also included in this classification 
the majority of the increase in this area relates to three items initial costs incurred to begin implementation of a common business system for all of the company s worldwide operations  outside service costs to assist in meeting the new requirements regarding internal controls under the sarbanes oxley act of  and the additional costs related to the company s executive office in place for the full year of compared to only six months of income taxes the company has a tax benefit of million in even though it reported pre tax net income of million 
the tax benefit is due to two primary factors 
first  the majority of the restructuring costs were incurred in the us  which are benefited at an effective corporate tax rate of percent  whereas  the majority of the earnings  primarily european based  are taxed at various statutory rates averaging approximately percent 
second  the company s operations in china and slovakia generated income in but there is no tax expense on these amounts as both countries have tax loss carryforwards with no previously recorded tax benefit 
the company expects its overall tax rate to return to a rate closer to the statutory rate in compared to consolidated results net income in was million  or per diluted share  compared with net income per diluted share of in special pretax charges of million in and million in had a negative impact on the results for the respective years 
the special charges for were million related to rationalizing overlapping product lines within the controls segment relating to the acquisition of the low voltage motor business te and a one time noncash after tax charge of million for goodwill impairment 
the special charges in related to plant closing costs of million and a bad debt write off of million relating to a customer in the aerial lift market filing for bankruptcy 
the following table  although not a us gaap disclosure  shows net income for the two years adjusted for these special charges in order to provide a more comparable picture of the company s net operating results in millions net income as reported product rationalization charge after tax goodwill impairment charge plant closing costs after tax bad debt write off after tax net income on comparable basis net income per share excluding the special charges in both years  net income in increased by percent over the primary factor for this improvement was the company s broad based cost control initiatives  particularly in the areas of fixed production costs  selling  general and administrative expenses  and research and development expenses 
in addition  the company focused significant attention on working capital management that resulted in a million reduction in trade receivables 
these factors helped generate a record operating cash flow of million  or an increase of percent over net sales in of million increased by million  or percent  over the sales of million 
excluding the impact of currency exchange fluctuations  net sales increased percent ie net sales of businesses outside the united states measured in us dollars would have been lower had currency exchange translation rates remained at the same levels as the rates that prevailed during excluding the impact of currency exchange fluctuations and acquisitions  net sales increased percent over gross profit in of million increased million or percent from gross profit of million 
the majority of the reported increase is a result of acquisitions completed in or those completed in and included for a full year in gross profit as a percentage of sales for was percent  compared to percent for while fixed production costs were reported to be million higher in compared to  the company successfully reduced overall fixed production costs by million compared to when the impact of currency exchange fluctuations and acquisitions are excluded 
had the company not achieved this cost reduction  gross profit as a percentage of sales would have declined slightly from pricing pressures within the markets the company serves continue to challenge the company to maintain profitability levels 
while the company was successful in reducing fixed costs in  it is not feasible to believe that the company can attain this same year over year reduction in this area 
therefore  the company has embarked on a global procurement initiative by establishing a global procurement office with resources in the us  europe  south america  and asia pacific 
the focus of this global procurement will be to leverage the company s global purchasing power to help reduce both direct and indirect material costs with a goal to obtain a to percent margin improvement over the next months 
in addition  significant focus will be placed on the procurement of nonproductive materials  supplies and services in order to achieve additional cost reductions to offset the ongoing pricing pressures 
the company s selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or percent  over the reported amount of million 
excluding the impact of currency exchange fluctuations  selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  and excluding acquisitions  these expenses actually declined from the levels by million  reflecting the company s focus on reducing fixed costs during research and development activities in were essentially flat with the levels in terms of reported amounts 
excluding the impact of currency exchange fluctuations and acquisitions  these expenses were million less than the levels 
while the company was focused on reducing fixed costs in all areas of the business  the company remains committed to investing in new technology and product development 
much of the company s product development activities continue to be driven by ongoing customer inquiries 
net nonoperating expenses increased by million over due primarily to foreign currency exchange losses and to the fact that the company no longer receives royalty income from its former japanese licensee as a result of forming a joint venture in the fourth quarter of this accounts for a million increase  which was offset by slightly lower net interest expense for the company s effective tax rate for of percent was lower than the effective tax rate of percent 
the primary factor for the lower effective rate in is related to the mix of the company s net income with a higher portion of the company s net income being generated in countries with lower effective tax rates 
business segment results the following discussion of operating results by reportable segment relates to information as presented in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
segment income is defined as the respective segment s portion of the total company s net income  excluding net interest  income taxes  minority interest  equity in net earnings of affiliates  and corporate expenses 
the format of this discussion for comparing the results from operations to is different from prior years due to the company changing its reportable segments beginning in to reflect the changes in organizational structure of the company around its various product lines of propel  work function and controls 
propel products include hydrostatic transmissions and related products that transmit the power from the engine to the wheel to propel a vehicle 
work function products include steering motors as well as gear pumps and motors that transmit power for the work functions of the vehicle 
controls products include electrohydraulic controls  microprocessors  and valves that control and direct the power of a vehicle 
propel segment net sales for the propel segment of million increased million  or percent  from net sales of million 
all geographic regions in which the propel segment operates experienced net sales growth 
excluding the impact of currency fluctuations  net sales increased million 
additionally  excluding the impact of acquisitions  net sales increased million from approximately million of the increase in net sales was driven by a new product introduction for compact utility tractors in the us and from the infinitely variable transmission developed for agriculture tractors 
an additional million of increased sales were generated from the turf care market in the americas 
however  these increases in the us were partially offset by declines in the agriculture  construction  specialty and distribution markets 
in europe  both the agriculture and road building markets experienced growth over the agriculture market in europe recovered somewhat in after several difficult years caused by the foot and mouth disease scare 
these increases in europe were offset be declines in the construction  turf care  and specialty markets 
propel segment income in of million increased million  or percent  over segment income of million in excluding the impact of currency exchange fluctuations and acquisitions  propel segment income increased million  with all of this increase being driven by the turf care market 
work function segment net sales in the work function segment of million in increased by million  or percent  over net sales of million 
excluding the impact of currency exchange fluctuations and acquisitions  net sales increased million  or percent  from while sales of steering units and low speed high torque motors increased million over  this was partially offset by a decline of gear pump and motor sales of million 
work function segment income in of million increased million  or percent  over segment income of million 
excluding the impact of currency exchange fluctuations  work function segment income increased million from the work function segment was impacted by a one time special charge of million in related to goodwill impairment 
the segment income was negatively impacted by a one time pretax charge of million related to plant closing costs 
excluding these special charges and the impact of currencies  segment income for the work function segment increased million  or percent  over  driven by the overall higher sales levels within this segment 
controls segment net sales in the controls segment in of million increased million  or percent  over segment net sales of million 
during  the company completed the acquisition of te 
the addition of this business added million of sales to this segment 
excluding this acquisition and the impact of currency exchange fluctuations  net sales for would have declined by million from the comparable levels 
the majority of this decrease comes from the aerial lift market in the us that continues to be depressed 
controls segment income for of million decreased million  or percent  from segment income of million 
the te business added million to the controls segment income 
excluding the impact of acquisitions and currency exchange fluctuations  the controls segment income declined million from however  in  the controls segment was negatively impacted by a special pretax charge of million relating to product line rationalization as a result of overlapping product lines within this segment relating to the acquisition of the te business 
on a comparable basis to  controls segment income declined million  or percent  from global services and other expenses  net the company s corporate function incurs costs that relate to worldwide services such as worldwide tax and accounting fees paid to outside third parties  certain insurance premiums  the amortization of intangible assets from certain business combinations  and internal global services departments  along with the operating costs of the company s executive offices which were established in located in lincolnshire  illinois 
for  total corporate charges amounted to million  or an increase of million from the charges of million 
order backlog total order backlog at the end of was million  compared to million at the end of  an increase of percent 
on a comparable basis  excluding the effects of acquisitions  order backlog increased percent from the year end levels  or percent excluding the additional impact of currency fluctuations 
during the fourth quarter of  million in new orders were written  an increase of percent compared to the fourth quarter of excluding the impact of acquisitions  orders written in the fourth quarter were million  which was percent more than the orders written in the fourth quarter of  but a decrease of percent excluding the additional impact of currency fluctuation 
market risk the company is naturally exposed to various market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates  and prices 
impact of foreign currency the company has historically not entered into any type of foreign currency hedging or derivative arrangements to manage its exposure to fluctuations in the foreign currency markets 
however  during  the company entered into a foreign currency hedge contract to protect against the effects of foreign currency fluctuations for a loan to the u 
s 
holding company from a danish bank denominated in euros 
the hedge resulted in offsetting approximately million of foreign currency loss which would have resulted from the dollar weakening against the euro during in addition  the company assumed a foreign currency exchange contract through its acquisition of the thrige electric business in denmark 
this contract expires in the company has operations and sells its products in many different countries of the world and therefore  conducts its business in various currencies 
the company s financial statements  which are presented in us dollars  can be impacted by foreign exchange fluctuations through both translation risk and transaction risk 
translation risk is the risk that the financial statements of the company  for a particular period or as of a certain date  may be affected by changes in the exchange rates that are used to translate the financial statements of the company s operations from foreign currencies into us dollars 
transaction risk is the risk from the company receiving its sale proceeds or holding its assets in a currency different from that in which it pays its expenses and holds its liabilities 
with respect to transaction risk  the impact on the company s operating results has not historically been significant 
in previous years  the company had been well balanced between its us and european operations because the company generated its sales in the same country in which it incurred its expenses  or shipped products between geographic regions on a balanced basis 
however  the company is no longer as equally balanced in terms of where it generates its sales compared to the currency in which the production costs are incurred 
in the company sold a total of million into the us of product that had been produced in european based currencies compared to sales into europe of million of product produced in us dollars 
this imbalance had a significant impact on the bottom line results of the company in the company is currently taking steps to analyze and understand this impact globally 
based on its analysis  the company may decide to re source certain operations or use hedging instruments in the future in order to protect against this margin erosion 
additionally  the company is impacted by translation risk in terms of comparing results from period to period 
fluctuations of currencies against the us dollar can be substantial and therefore significantly impact comparisons with prior periods 
the translation impact on making prior period comparisons with respect to the company s net sales can be material 
as shown in the table below  historically the translation impact on net sales had not been significant  however  in this difference has become quite substantial 
percentage sales growth decline over prior year as reported without currency translation impact comparison of to includes the effect of danfoss fluid power for the full year of on a pro forma basis and excludes the effects of acquisitions made in during  the us dollar continued to weaken substantially against most foreign currencies  especially the euro 
between december  and december   the us dollar weakened by percent against the euro  which followed a percent weakening between and this has resulted in approximately one third of the company s total balance sheet being stated percent higher than the prior year since roughly one third of the company s total assets and liabilities are denominated in the euro 
as shown above  translation does affect comparisons between periods 
interest rates the company does not currently manage its interest rate change exposure by entering into any type of interest rate hedging or derivative arrangement 
the following table summarizes the maturity of the company s debt obligations for fixed and variable rate debt amounts in millions fixed rate debt variable rate debt thereafter total liquidity and capital resources the following table shows condensed balance sheet information for the company as of december  compared to december  the information has been translated using the same exchange rates as were used for the balance sheet to make the us dollar amounts comparable 
in addition  the acquisition completed during that was not included in the amounts has been excluded for comparison purposes 
this table shows only the change in balances on a comparable basis  it does not show the actual cash flow impact to the company 
in millions as reported comparable basis as reported constant dollar change percent change cash accounts receivable inventories other current assets total current assets net property  plant and equipment goodwill and other intangibles other long term assets total assets  short term debt and notes payable accounts payable accrued liabilities total current liabilities long term debt pension liability deferred taxes other long term liabilities minority interest in consolidated companies total stockholders equity total liabilities and stockholders equity  the amount includes million of investment in comatrol which was accounted for under the equity method at december  the company s principal sources of liquidity have been from internally generated funds from operations and from borrowings under its committed and uncommitted  unsecured  credit facilities 
because of the multiple funding sources that have been and continue to be available to the company  the company expects to have sufficient sources of liquidity to meet its funding needs 
the company has historically accessed diverse funding sources  including short term and long term unsecured bank lines of credit in the united states  europe and asia  as well as private securitization markets in the united states 
in addition  the company has access to unsecured bank lines of credit with various banks from around the world see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company operates under certain covenants as defined under its various credit agreements with its banks 
in september the company entered into a new multicurrency revolving credit facility that permits unsecured borrowings up to million through september the proceeds from the new facility were used to repay outstanding borrowings under several of its other credit facilities 
at december  there was million outstanding under the new facility 
debt issuance costs of million were capitalized and are being amortized to interest expense over the three year term of the facility 
the company is required to meet certain financial covenants under this facility as described in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company was in compliance with the covenants at december  and is not aware of any circumstances currently that would impact said compliance during the next twelve months 
cash flows from operations the company s cash provided from operations in was a strong million  slightly below the record level of million generated in overall working capital management in slipped from the successful efforts achieved in this resulted in million less cash provided from working capital than in the accounts receivable balance increased only percent in compared to  excluding the impact of currency and acquisition 
this is notable considering sales in the fourth quarter of increased almost percent compared to sales in the fourth quarter of  excluding the impact of currency and acquisition 
the company s overall days sales outstanding dso  the measure of how many days of product sales are yet to be collected from customers was days in compared to days for the company has put a significant amount of effort into improving the collection activities in the us that has resulted in a reduction in dso from to at the end of the company is now looking at creating shared service centers in europe to aid in reducing the number of days sales outstanding 
the company s inventory management activities took a step back in that resulted in approximately million more being invested in inventories at the end of compared to part of this increase in inventory is a direct result of the company s efforts to reorganize its sales and distribution operations in europe 
the company began the process in to move inventory in europe from its individual sales companies back to the original manufacturing locations and centralized logistics centers 
the company anticipates that this will reduce inventory in the long term and enable it to better respond to customers needs and maintain lower overall inventory levels 
this action should also reduce the amount of risk associated with potentially excess and obsolete inventory 
accounts payable management has improved in as the company has achieved better terms in paying its suppliers that are more in line with the timing of the collections from its own customers 
this resulted in increased cash flow by million compared to overall  the company s cash balances remained level with  on a comparable dollar basis 
the company s overall goal is to minimize the amount of cash on its balance sheet as long as it has outstanding bank borrowings 
at the end of  over million of the company s cash resided in china  and an additional million was located in brazil 
due to the nature of governmental and other regulatory controls  it is extremely difficult to move cash out of these countries for reasons other than payment for goods shipped into these countries 
as the company continues to look at expanding its manufacturing capabilities in low cost regions  the company will look to utilize the cash already located in these countries to fund these expansions 
cash used in investing activities the company has continued to selectively invest in capital equipment for its manufacturing plants for more efficient manufacturing processes and for new product development 
in addition  in the company invested over million in a new common business system mentioned above in the executive summary 
this amount represents all of the user licenses for its worldwide operations as well as certain capitalizable costs for outside consulting and internal dedicated resource costs for the development of the new system 
the company anticipates it will incur an additional million of capitalized costs in before the implementation phase of this common business system begins 
during the company completed one acquisition for a net cash outlay of million 
see the discussion of business combinations below and note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
cash used in financing activities aside from the activities under the company s various borrowing arrangements as discussed earlier  the company also pays a dividend to its shareholders on a quarterly basis 
the dividend is set by the company s board of directors and is currently at an annual rate of per share 
this has resulted in million of annual dividend payments for each of the last years 
the company does not anticipate this changing in in addition  the company periodically makes distributions to its minority interest partners from its various joint venture activities 
this amount can vary from year to year depending on the amount of undistributed earnings of the businesses and the needs of the partners 
contractual cash obligations the majority of the company s contractual obligations to make cash payments to third parties are for financing obligations 
these include future lease payments under both operating and capital leases 
the following table discloses the company s future commitments under contractual obligations as of december  contractual cash obligations total thereafter long term debt and notes payable    capital leases       operating leases      total contractual cash obligations    in addition to the above contractual obligations  the company has certain other funding needs that are non contractual by nature  including funding of certain pension plans 
for  the company anticipates contributing million to its us pension plan and million to its uk pension plan 
there are no plans to fund the german pension plan  which is customary in that country 
other matters critical accounting estimates the sec s guidance surrounding the disclosure of critical accounting estimates requires disclosures about estimates a company makes in applying its accounting policies 
however  such discussion is limited to critical accounting estimates  or those that management believes meet two criteria the accounting estimate must require a company to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made  and different estimates that the company reasonably could have used for the accounting estimate in the current period  or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  must have a material impact on the presentation of the company s financial condition  changes in financial condition or results of operations 
besides the estimates that meet the two criteria for a critical estimate above  the company makes many other accounting estimates in preparing its financial statements and related disclosures 
all estimates  whether or not deemed critical  can affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses as well as disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
estimates are based on experience and information available prior to the issuance of the financial statements 
materially different results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known  including estimates not deemed critical under the sec s guidance 
the discussion below should be read in conjunction with disclosures elsewhere in this discussion and in the notes to the consolidated financial statements related to estimates  uncertainties  contingencies  and new accounting standards 
significant accounting policies are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page the development and selection of accounting estimates  including those deemed critical  and the associated disclosures in this discussion  have been discussed by management with the audit committee of the board of directors 
inventory valuation as a manufacturer in the capital goods industry  inventory is a substantial portion of the assets of the company  amounting to almost percent of total assets at december  the company must periodically evaluate the carrying value of its inventory to assess the proper valuation 
this includes having adequate allowances and period adjustments to cover losses in the normal course of operation  provide for excess and obsolete inventory  and ensure that inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market 
on a quarterly basis  management within each segment performs an analysis of the underlying inventory to identify the need for appropriate allowances to cover all of these 
in doing so  management applies consistent practices based upon historical data such as actual loss experience  past and projected usage  actual margins generated from trade sales of its products  and finally its best judgment to estimate the appropriate allowances 
warranty provisions the company warrants its various products over differing periods depending upon the type of product and application 
consequently  the company records liabilities for the estimated warranty costs that may be incurred under its basic warranty based on past trends of actual warranty claims compared to the actual sales levels to which those claims apply 
these liabilities are accrued at the time the sales of the products are recorded 
factors that affect the company s warranty liability include the number of units in the field currently under warranty  historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims on those units and the cost per claim to satisfy the company s warranty obligation 
the anticipated rate of warranty claims is the primary factor impacting the company s estimated warranty obligation 
each quarter  the company reevaluates its estimates to assess the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary 
in addition to its normal warranty liability  the company  from time to time in the normal course of business  incurs costs to repair or replace defective products with a specific customer or group of customers 
the company refers to these as field recalls and in these instances  the company will record a specific provision for the expected costs it will incur to repair or replace these products utilizing information from customers and internal information regarding the specific cost of materials and labor 
typically  field recalls are infrequent in occurrence  however  when they occur  field recalls can be for a large number of units and quite costly to rectify 
because of the sporadic and infrequent nature of field recalls  and due to the extreme range of costs associated with field recalls  the company cannot accurately estimate these costs at the time the products are sold 
therefore  these costs are recorded at the time information becomes known to the company 
as the field recalls are settled  the company relieves the specific liability related to that field recall 
these specific field recall liabilities are reviewed at least on a quarterly basis 
long lived asset recovery a significant portion of the company s total assets consist of property  plant and equipment pp e and definite life intangibles  as well as goodwill and indefinite life intangibles 
changes in technology or in the company s intended use of these assets  as well as changes in the broad global economy in which the company operates  may cause the estimated period of use or the carrying value of these assets to change 
this requires the company to periodically assess the estimated useful lives of its assets in order to match  through depreciation  the cost of those assets with the benefits derived over the period of usefulness 
the useful lives of these assets can be shortened through greater use due to volume increases  rapidly changing technology such as the use of electronics and computer operated controls  and through inadequate maintenance 
despite management s best efforts to determine the appropriate useful lives of its equipment  certain situations arise that lead to an asset or group of assets becoming impaired  meaning their economic value becomes less than the value at which the company is carrying the asset on its books 
examples of these situations are product rationalization efforts or restructuring of manufacturing facilities 
when these situations arise  the company tests the assets for impairment and will write down the asset in the period when the impairment becomes known 
if information would become known that would change the depreciable rate of the company s assets by percent  recorded depreciation expense would have been impacted by approximately million 
valuation of trade receivables the company records trade receivables due from its customers at the time a sale is recorded in accordance with its revenue recognition policy 
the future collectability of these amounts can be impacted by the company s collection efforts  the financial stability of its customers  and the general economic climate in which it operates 
the company applies a consistent practice of establishing an allowance for accounts that it believes may become uncollectible through reviewing the historical aging of its receivables  looking at the historical losses incurred as a percentage of net sales  and by monitoring the financial strength of its customers 
in addition  local customary practices have to be taken into account due to varying payment terms being applied in various parts of the world where the company conducts its business 
if the company becomes aware of a customer s inability to meet its financial obligations eg  where it has filed for bankruptcy  the company establishes a specific allowance for the potential bad debt to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount it reasonably believes will be collected 
the valuation of trade receivables is performed quarterly 
workers compensation the company has an insurance policy to cover workers compensation claims in the united states  in which the company pays the first million per claim  per incident 
the company establishes its workers compensation reserve based on historic growth factors of claims and an estimate of incurred  but not reported claims 
this analysis is performed on a quarterly basis  or more frequently if factors dictate a more frequent review 
pensions the company has noncontributory defined benefit pension plans for a majority of its employees 
in certain countries  such as the united states and the united kingdom  these plans are funded with plan assets whereas in other countries such as germany  the plans are completely unfunded  which is customary 
the measurement of the company s pension obligations and costs is dependent on a variety of assumptions used by the company s actuaries 
these assumptions include estimates of the present value of projected future pension payments to all plan participants  taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future events such as salary increases and other experience 
these assumptions may have an effect on the amount and timing of future contributions 
the plan trustee conducts an independent valuation of the fair value of pension plan assets 
the assumptions used in developing the required estimates include the following key factors discount rates salary growth retirement rates inflation expected return on plan assets mortality rates the company bases the discount rate assumption on investment yields available at or near year end on corporate long term bonds rated aa 
the inflation assumption is based on an evaluation of external market indicators 
the salary growth assumptions reflect the company s long term actual experience  the near term outlook and assumed inflation 
the expected return on plan assets reflects asset allocations  investment strategy and the views of investment managers and other large pension plan sponsors 
retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience and actuarial tables  respectively 
the effects of actual results differing from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  generally affect our recognized expense in such future periods 
the company s funding policy for the us plans is to contribute amounts sufficient to meet the minimum funding requirement of the employee retirement income security act of  plus any additional amounts the company may deem to be appropriate 
for  the company anticipates contributing million to its us plans and million to its us plans 
postretirement benefits other than pensions the company provides a single postretirement health care benefit for certain employee groups in the united states 
this plan is contributory and contains certain other cost sharing features such as deductibles and coinsurance 
the company does not pre fund this plan and has the right to modify or terminate this plan in the future 
the company accounts for its postretirement benefits in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  which requires the postretirement liability recognized in the consolidated balance sheets and the postretirement expense recognized in the consolidated statements of income be determined on an actuarial basis 
to account for its postretirement benefits in accordance with sfas no 
 the company must make two determinations 
first  it must determine the actuarial assumption for the discount rate used to reflect the time value of money in the calculation of the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for the end of the current year and to determine the postretirement cost for the subsequent year 
for guidance in determining this rate  the company looks at investment yields available at or near year end on corporate bonds rated aa 
second  the company must determine the actuarial assumption for the health care trend rate used in the calculation of the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for the end of the current year and to determine the net periodic postretirement benefit cost for the subsequent year 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for information on the assumptions used as of december  as of december   a one percentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend rate would impact the expense recognized in by million and would affect the post retirement benefit obligation by million 
deferred income taxes tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements 
some of the differences are permanent  such as expenses which are not deductible on a tax return  and some of the differences are temporary  such as depreciation expense 
timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets generally are attributable to items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in a tax return in future years but the amount has already been included as an expense in the financial statements 
deferred tax liabilities generally represent deductions which have been taken on the tax return but have not been recognized as expense in the financial statements 
valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized

at this time  specific authoritative guidance on the accounting for the federal subsidy provided by the act is pending and that guidance could require the company to modify previously reported information  however the company does not expect the act to have a significant effect on its financial statements
