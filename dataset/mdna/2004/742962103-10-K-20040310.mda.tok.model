item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview privatebancorp was organized as a delaware corporation in to serve as the holding company for a chicago based de novo start up bank 
our flagship downtown chicago location opened in we expanded to wilmette in north suburban cook county in and the oak brook facility in west suburban dupage county was established in we established the st 
charles office in january  in connection with our purchase of towne square financial corporation a company which was in the process of forming a de novo  or start up bank on august  on february   we consummated our acquisition of johnson bank illinois adding two additional locations in lake forest and winnetka  illinois 
during the second quarter  we received regulatory approval to create a new banking subsidiary and on june   privatebancorp capitalized the privatebank st 
louis 
in may  the privatebank chicago opened a second branch in the fox valley area in geneva  illinois 
in december  the privatebank chicago acquired an controlling interest in lodestar investment counsel  a chicago based investment adviser with million of assets under management at december  we completed our initial public offering in june of since year end to december   we have grown our asset base at a compound annual rate of to billion 
during the same period  loans have grown at a compound annual rate of to billion  deposits at a compound annual rate of to billion and core deposits at a compound annual rate of to billion 
wealth management assets under management grew at a compound annual rate of to billion 
diluted earnings per share eps have grown at a compound annual rate of to split adjusted since year end for financial information regarding our four separate lines of business  the privatebank chicago  the privatebank st 
louis  wealth management services and holding company activities  see operating segments results beginning on page and note operating segments to our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december   included on page f the profitability of our operations depends on our net interest income  provision for loan losses  non interest income  and non interest expense 
net interest income is dependent on the amounts and yields of interest earning assets as compared to the amounts and rates on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income is sensitive to changes in market rates of interest as well as to the execution of our asset liability management strategy 
the provision for loan losses is affected by changes in the loan portfolio  management s assessment of the collectability of the loan portfolio  loss experience  as well as economic and market factors 
non interest income consists primarily of net security gains and wealth management fee income  and to a lesser extent  fees for ancillary banking services 
non interest income from fees and deposit service charges are below peer group levels 
this is largely the result of the profile of our typical client 
our clients tend to have larger deposit account balances than customers of traditional banks 
because average balances tend to be high  we do not earn high service charge income typical of many retail banks 
non interest expenses are heavily influenced by the growth of operations 
our growth directly affects the majority of our expense categories 
critical accounting policies the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included herein 
reference should also be made to our critical accounting policies set out in the notes to consolidated financial statements  beginning on page f certain critical policies involve estimates and assumptions by management 
by their nature  changes in these assumptions and estimates could significantly affect our financial position or results of operations 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
estimates and judgments regarding the determination of the adequacy of the reserve for loan losses  as described in both management s discussion and analysis and in the financial statement notes  is of particular significance to us 
in addition  
table of contents effective january   we adopted fas no 
 which requires that goodwill is no longer amortized but is tested annually for impairment 
allowance for loan losses we maintain an allowance for loan losses at a level management believes is sufficient to absorb credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses represents our estimate of probable losses in the portfolio at each balance sheet date and is based on a review of available and relevant information 
the allowance contains provisions for probable losses that have been identified relating to specific borrowing relationships as well as probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio and credit undertakings that are not specifically identified 
our allowance for loan losses is reassessed monthly to determine the appropriate level of the allowance 
the amount of the allowance for loan losses is determined based on a variety of factors  including assessment of the credit risk of the loans in the portfolio  volume of loans in the portfolio  delinquent loans  impaired loans  evaluation of current economic conditions in the market area  actual charge offs and recoveries during the period and historical loss experience 
the unallocated portion of the reserve involves the exercise of judgment by management and reflects various considerations  including management s view that the reserve should have a margin that recognizes the imprecision inherent in the process of estimating credit losses 
management adjusts the allowance for loan losses by recording a provision for loan losses in an amount sufficient to maintain the allowance at the level determined appropriate 
loans are charged off when deemed to be uncollectible by management 
we believe that the allowance for loan losses is adequate to provide for estimated probable credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was as of december  compared to as of december  goodwill and intangible assets during  the privatebank chicago recorded approximately million in goodwill in connection with the johnson bank illinois acquisition 
during  the company recorded million of goodwill and million in customer intangibles in connection with the acquisition of lodestar 
intangible assets are amortized over an estimated useful life of years 
effective january   the company adopted fas no 
 which requires that goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite lives no longer be amortized but be reviewed for impairment annually  or more frequently if certain indicators arise 
prior to the adoption of fas no 
 goodwill was being amortized using the straight line method over a period of years 
the company did not incur any goodwill impairment in in adopting fas an annual impairment test of goodwill is performed each year by the company 
impairment losses on recorded goodwill will be recorded as operating expenses 
goodwill at december  and december  was million 
amortization expense related to the lodestar customer intangible assets is expected to be recorded in the amount of  each year for years 
consolidated results of operations net income our net income for the year ended december  was million  or per diluted share  compared to million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  our earnings per share increased as compared to the prior year earnings per share 
net income for the year ended december  was million  or per diluted share  compared to million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  our earnings per share increased as compared to the prior year earnings per share 
the increase in earnings from operations is primarily attributable to growth in the balance sheet  particularly in loans and investment securities  funded by growth in deposits and improvement in our net interest margin 
increased fee income  mainly from increases in wealth management revenue  and income from the sale of residential real estate loans in the secondary market  also contributed to the improvement in income 
net interest income net interest income is the difference between interest income and fees on earning assets and interest expense and amortization of fees on deposits and borrowings 
net interest margin represents the net interest income on a tax 
table of contents equivalent basis as a percentage of average earning assets during the period 
net interest margin reflects the spread between average yields earned on interest earning assets and the average rates paid on interest bearing deposits and borrowings 
interest income includes amortization of loan origination fees recorded from loans 
interest expense includes amortization of prepaid fees on brokered deposits and issuance costs of trust preferred securities 
the volume of non interest bearing funds  largely comprised of demand deposits and capital  also affects the net interest margin 
net interest income was million for the year ended december   compared to million for  an increase of 
net interest income is affected by both the volume of assets and liabilities held and the corresponding rates earned and paid 
the increase in net interest income for is primarily attributable to growth in earning assets 
average earning assets for were billion compared to billion for  an increase of 
our net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis was for the year ended december   compared to for the prior year 
increased volumes of interest earning assets at lower rates were offset by reduced interest rates on liabilities 
while our cost of funds was significantly less during than  compared to  respectively  our loans yielded in loan interest in compared to in non interest bearing funds impact net interest margin since they represent non interest bearing sources of funds that are deployed in interest bearing assets 
non interest bearing funds positively impacted net interest margin by at december  and december  during  our net interest margin was impacted by decreases in the costs of our average interest bearing liabilities throughout the year 
we made significant changes to funds borrowed during the second half of the year  prepaying a million  fixed rate fhlb advance that was scheduled to mature on december  we replaced the advance with two new fhlb advances totaling million with substantially longer maturities and lower interest rates than the original advance 
late in the third quarter we repaid million outstanding on a line of credit 
during the fourth quarter of we added an additional million of borrowings through the fhlb at market rates or at lower rates of interest than the debt that was refunded 
margin was further improved by a one half percentage point increase on the third quarter fhlb dividend to  the fhlb paid annualized dividends of for the first  second and fourth quarters of net interest income was million for the year ended december   compared to million for  an increase of 
the increase in net interest income for is primarily attributable to growth in earning assets 
average earning assets for were billion compared to million for  an increase of 
our net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis was for the year ended december   compared to for the prior year 
during  we experienced net interest margin pressure as compared to due to the decrease in market interest rates that occurred throughout in addition  during our floating rate assets repriced faster than our deposits and floating rate deposits 
also  we continued to utilize brokered deposit transactions as part of our asset liability management strategy 
these brokered deposits have staggered maturities and provide a lower costing source of funding compared to traditional deposits 
a changing interest rate environment has an effect on our net interest margin 
a large portion of our loan portfolio is based on floating interest rates and may reprice faster than our deposits and floating rate borrowings 
for  we expect our net interest margin to remain stable or improve slightly if market interest rates increase relative to levels 
alternatively  if market interest rates decrease  we expect our net interest margin to experience pressure

the provision for loan losses reflects management s latest assessment of the inherent losses in the loan portfolio 
our allowance for probable loan losses is reassessed monthly to determine the appropriate level of the reserve 
our analysis is influenced by the following factors the volume and quality of loans and commitments in the portfolio  loss experience  and economic conditions 
a discussion of the allowance for loan losses and the factors on which provisions are based begins on page the changes recorded in the components of the allowance for loan losses resulted in a provision for loan losses of million for the year ended december  compared to million in  and million in the increase in the provision for loan losses in is due to several factors 
we continued to experience strong loan growth  principally in commercial real estate and construction loans 
these loans entail greater risk than residential mortgage and consumer loans 
another factor was the weakening of credit quality of certain borrowers as reflected by risk rating downgrades in we believe that these downgrades reflect the impact of a slowing economy on the portfolio 
thirdly  as a result of increases in our lending limit  we believe we have an increasingly more complex loan portfolio and growth in the dollar amount of individual credit exposures  which warranted increased provisions

we believe that the allowance for loan losses is adequate to provide for estimated probable credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio 
under our methodology  the allowance for loan losses is comprised of the following components specific component of the reserve the specific component of the reserve is determined on a loan by loan basis as part of a regular review of our loan portfolio 
we utilize a loan rating system to assist in developing an internal problem loan identification system watch list as a means for identifying and reporting non performing and potential problem loans 
these loans are allocated specifically identified reserves based on the loan ratings assigned to individual loans 
the specific reserve is based on a loan s current book value compared to the present value of its projected future cash flows  collateral value or market value  as is relevant for the particular loan 
the portion of the provision related to the specific component of the reserve was million during due to an increased amount of identified credit relationships that have been adversely impacted by the slow down of the economy and have been allocated specifically identified reserves based on the loan ratings assigned to individual loans and other extensions of credit 
allocated inherent component of the reserve the allocated portion of the inherent component of the reserve is based on management s review of historical and industry charge off experience as well as its judgment regarding loans in each loan category over a period of time that management determines is adequate to reflect longer term economic trends 
loss factors are evaluated by management and adjusted based on current facts and circumstances 
loss factor adjustments reflect management s assessment of the credit risk inherent in each loan category 
the portion of the provision related to the allocated inherent component of the reserve was million during the increase in the allocated portion of the reserve reflects a significant migration of loans to slightly higher risk ratings as well as the increase in volume in our commercial real estate loan portfolio and construction loan portfolio 
loss factors for the construction and commercial real estate loan portfolios were also increased to reflect management s evaluation of the current economic conditions and its impact on these sectors of the portfolio 
management has identified a weakening of credit quality of certain borrowers as reflected by risk rating downgrades in management has noticed lower sales  decreased profitability and lower cash flows within its client base 
these trends led to the increased loss factors noted above 
the increase in this component of the reserve was partially offset by a decline in the impact of residential real estate and home equity loans  resulting from a decrease in their respective loss factors 
loss factors applied to residential real estate and home equity loans were decreased or unchanged based on management s assessment of our historical loss experience coupled with the quality of the underlying collateral securing the residential real estate and home equity loan portfolios 
unallocated inherent components of the reserve the unallocated portion of the inherent component of the reserve is based on management s review of other factors affecting the determination of probable losses inherent in the portfolio  which are not necessarily captured by the application of loss factors 
this portion of the reserve analysis involves the exercise of judgment and reflects consideration such as management s view that the reserve should have a margin that recognizes the imprecision inherent in the process of estimating credit losses 
the portion of the provision related to the unallocated inherent component of the reserve was million in the decrease reflects our view that the inherent losses related to certain factors  such as general economic and business conditions and the possible imprecision due to changes in the portfolio mix  which we considered in our evaluation of the unallocated allowance at december  are now recognized at december  in the allocated allowance through increased specific reserves or in the higher loss factors utilized in determining the risk allocated allowance 
the trend of increasing specific credit risk in our loan portfolio indicates that larger allocated reserves are appropriate as evident by the fact that our net charge off s of  for included  of losses attributable to two commercial borrowers 
the growth and complexity of the loan portfolio exposes us to larger individual charge offs 

table of contents management s application of the methodology for determining the allowance for loan losses resulted in a reserve for credit losses of million at december  compared with million at december  the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was as of december   compared to as of december  net charge offs for the years ended december  and were  and  respectively 
net charge offs to average total loans were for compared to for non performing loans the following table classifies our non performing loans as of the dates shown december  dollars in thousands nonaccrual loans loans past due days or more total non performing loans total non performing assets non accrual loans to total loans total non performing loans to total loans total non performing assets to total assets it is our policy to discontinue the accrual of interest income on any loan for which there exists reasonable doubt as to the payment of interest or principal 
nonaccrual loans are returned to an accrual status when the financial position of the borrower indicates there is no longer any reasonable doubt as to the payment of principal or interest 
other than those loans reflected in the table above  we had no significant loans for which the terms had been renegotiated or restructured  or for which there were serious doubts as to the ability of the borrower to comply with repayment terms 
we did not have any other real estate owned as of any of the dates shown 
potential problem loans 
in addition to those loans reflected in the table above  we have identified some loans through our problem loan identification process which exhibit a higher than normal credit risk 
loans in this category include loans with characteristics such as past maturity more than days  those that have recent adverse operating cash flow or balance sheet trends  or loans that have general risk characteristics that management believes might jeopardize the future timely collection of principal and interest payments 
the balance in this category at any reporting period can fluctuate widely based on the timing of cash collections  renegotiations and renewals 
the principal amount of loans in this category as of december  was million 
at december   there were no significant loans which were classified by any bank regulatory agency that are not included above as nonaccrual  past due or restructured 
nonaccrual loans were  as of december  compared to  at december  nonperforming loans include nonaccrual loans and accruing loans that are days or more delinquent 
nonperforming loans were million as of december   compared to million at december  nonperforming loans were  and of total loans at december  and december   respectively 
nonperforming assets were and of total assets as of december  and december  respectively 
loan concentrations 
loan concentrations are considered to exist when there are amounts loaned to a multiple number of borrowers engaged in similar activities which would cause them to be similarly impacted by economic or other conditions 
at december   our commercial real estate loans totaled approximately million or of our total loan portfolio 
commercial real estate typically involves higher loan principal amounts  and the repayment of these loans generally is dependant  in large part  on the successful operation of the property securing the loan or the business conducted on the property securing the loan 
these loans may be more adversely affected by general conditions in the real estate markets or in the economy 
other than loans made to borrowers residing in the chicago and st 
louis metropolitan areas and our involvement in lending secured by real estate  we had no concentrations of loans exceeding of total loans at december  or december

federal funds sold are overnight investments in which  except for cash reserves  all remaining funds are invested 
our debt securities portfolio is primarily comprised of us government agency obligations  municipal bonds  mortgage backed pools and collateralized mortgage obligations 
our equity investments consist of equity investments in fhlb of chicago stock 
all securities are classified as available for sale and may be sold as part of our asset liability management strategy in response to changes in interest rates  liquidity needs or significant prepayment risk 
securities available for sale are carried at fair value  with related unrealized net gains or losses  net of deferred income taxes  recorded as an adjustment to equity capital

this represented an improvement of million from unrealized securities gains net of tax of million at december  net unrealized gains increased to million at december  compared to net unrealized gains of million at december  the increase in net unrealized gains occurred despite a small rise in interest rates during the period 
this is attributable to a number of factors including the realization of some losses on securities during the year  which increased the net unrealized gain position  and to the timing of the purchase of several securities 
securities available for sale increased to million at december   up from million as of december  the growth in the investment security portfolio since december  resulted from the continued implementation of our asset liability management strategy

historically  we have elected to pay interest based on the three month libor rate basis points 
on july   the outstanding balance on the line of credit was paid in full using proceeds from the common stock offering completed on july  the payoff included interest of  in february  we issued a subordinated note  in the principal amount of million  as part of the purchase price for its acquisition of johnson bank illinois 
the interest on the subordinated note was reset each quarter based on the three month libor rate 
the note was payable in full on or before february   and provided for certain rate escalation beginning after february  on february   the interest rate increased from libor basis points to libor basis points 
this pricing was in effect until february   at which point the pricing would have increased to libor basis points until maturity on february  on august   the subordinated note was paid in full 
membership in the federal home loan bank system gives us the ability to borrow funds from the federal home loan bank of chicago and from the federal home loan bank of des moines for short or long term purposes under a variety of programs 
we have periodically used services of the fhlb for funding needs and other correspondent services 
during  we increased our use of federal home loan bank advances to fund loan and investment securities growth 
management anticipates that our reliance on federal home loan bank borrowings as a funding source will likely continue to increase in to the extent that rates on federal home loan bank advances continue to be more attractive than brokered deposit pricing 
federal home loan bank borrowings totaled million at december  compared to million at december

louis we accept deposits from a variety of municipal entities 
typically  these municipal entities require that banks pledge marketable securities to collateralize these public deposits 
the state of illinois also accepts fhlb letters of credit as collateral 
at december  and  we had approximately million and million  respectively  of securities collateralizing such public deposits 
deposits requiring pledged assets are not considered to be core deposits  and the assets that are pledged as collateral for these deposits are not deemed to be liquid assets 
on february   we issued million in trust preferred securities at a fixed rate of which mature on december  at our option  the securities may be redeemed prior to maturity on or after december  the trust preferred securities are presented in our consolidated balance sheet as long term debt trust preferred securities 
risk management we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates that could affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities 
during  we began to hedge interest rate risk through the use of derivative financial instruments 
we use derivative financial instruments as a risk management tool 
interest rate risk we use a combination of financial instruments  including medium term and short term financings and variable rate debt instruments and  to a lesser extent  interest rate swaps to manage the interest rate mix of our total debt portfolio and related cash flows 
to manage this mix in a cost effective manner  in we entered into our first interest rate swap transaction in which we agreed to receive a fixed rate in exchange for payment of a floating rate based on an agreed upon notional amount 
the fair value of the swap associated with this fair value hedge was million on december  as market interest rates continued to decline to historic lows in the second half of  the value of our long term tax exempt bank qualified municipal bond portfolio increased 
in order to protect this gain should rates rise  we entered into a million swap agreement whereby we sold the year swap and bought month libor to act as an economic hedge to a portion of our long municipal bonds 
at december  the market value of the interest rate swap associated with this economic hedge was a liability of  during  a loss of  on the swap was recognized in earnings and resulted from changes in market rates of interest 
during  we continued to actively manage our interest rate exposure in our balance sheet 
the declines in market rates gave us the opportunity to make changes to our investment security portfolio as part of the implementation of our asset liability management strategies 
throughout  we continued to replace specific investment securities with alternative investment securities with greater risk reward parameters on a selective basis 
during the third quarter of  we prepaid a million  fixed rate fhlb advance that was scheduled to mature on december  we replaced the advance and other maturing short term advances with several longer term fhlb advances at lower rates during the year 
approximately million in new fhlb advances at lower rates were borrowed during  of that amount  million was negotiated in the fourth quarter of the improvements in net interest margin resulting from the improved mix of investment securities coupled with our lower yielding sources of funding offset the yield compression experienced in our loan portfolio  which is more than half floating rate based 

table of contents we have not changed our interest rate risk management strategy from the prior year and do not foresee or expect any significant changes in our exposure to interest rate fluctuations  but we will continue to consider the use of interest rate swaps on our debt obligations in the future depending on changes in market rates of interest 
capital resources stockholders equity at december  rose to million  an increase of million from the year end level of million  due primarily to the proceeds received from our common stock offering and net income generated during on july   the company completed its sale of  shares of common stock in an underwritten public offering 
the public offering price was 
net proceeds to the company totaled approximately million 
during  the company granted  restricted shares to directors and certain officers of the company 
these shares vest after five years 
the company and its banking subsidiaries are subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking agencies 
capital adequacy guidelines and prompt corrective action regulations involve quantitative measures of assets  liabilities and certain off balance sheet items calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about components  risk weightings and other factors  and the regulators can lower classifications in certain areas 
failure to meet various capital requirements can initiate regulatory action that could have a direct material effect on the financial statements 
the prompt corrective action regulations provide five classifications well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized  and critically undercapitalized  although these terms are not used to represent overall financial condition 
if a banking subsidiary is not well capitalized  regulatory approval is required to accept brokered deposits 
if undercapitalized  capital distributions are limited as is asset growth and expansion and plans for capital restoration are required

table of contents liquidity liquidity measures our ability to meet maturing obligations and our existing commitments  to withstand fluctuations in deposit levels  to fund our operations and to provide for our clients credit needs 
our liquidity principally depends on our cash flows from our operating activities  investment in and maturity of assets  changes in balances of deposits and borrowings and our ability to borrow funds in the money or capital markets 
liquidity management involves planning to meet anticipated funding needs at a reasonable cost 
liquidity management is guided by policies  formulated and monitored by our senior management and the banks asset liability committees  which take into account the marketability of assets  the sources and stability of funding and the level of unfunded commitments 
our principal sources of funds are deposits  short term borrowings and capital contributions by privatebancorp to the banks funded by proceeds from draws on our line of credit or through new capital 
our core deposits  the most stable source of liquidity due to the nature of long term relationships generally established with our clients  are available to provide long term liquidity 
at december   of our total assets were funded by core deposits  compared to december  levels of 
core deposits are defined to include all deposits including time deposits but excluding brokered deposits and public funds 
time deposits are included as core deposits since these deposits have historically not been volatile deposits for us 
over the past several years  our clients have chosen to keep the maturities of their deposits short 
we expect these short term certificates of deposit to be renewed on terms and with maturities similar to those currently in place 
in the event that certain of these certificates of deposit are not renewed and the funds are withdrawn from the bank  unless those deposits are replaced with traditional deposits  brokered deposits  borrowed money or capital  we will liquidate assets to reduce our funding needs 
we have continued to use fhlb advances and brokered deposits as alternative methods of funding growth 
during  we first utilized brokered deposits as a funding tool to enhance liquidity in anticipation of increasing loan demand 
during and we expanded our brokered deposits program in order to fund liquidity of the privatebank chicago and the privatebank st 
louis 
in we expect to continue to rely on brokered deposits together with increased fhlb advances as alternative methods of funding growth and may increase the level of our brokered deposits 
our asset liability management policy currently limits our use of brokered deposits to levels no more than of total deposits 
we do not expect our threshold limitation to limit our ability to implement our growth plan 
we will first look toward internally generated deposits as funding sources  but plan to supplement our funding needs with non traditional funding sources as needed 
consistent with this policy  brokered deposits to total deposits were of total deposits at december   compared to of total deposits at december  subject to the waiver of the required notice period  our investment in fhlb stock is a source of liquidity for us 
on may   we purchased million of additional fhlb stock due to the liquid nature of the investment and management s belief that the fhlb of chicago has shown a consistently strong fundamental business performance 
at december   we owned million of fhlb stock 
we can elect at any time to sell fhlb stock at par back to the fhlb  excluding the required fhlb stock minimum that needs to be maintained in order to support existing fhlb advances 
fhlb has communicated to us that generally the stock will be redeemed immediately upon a request by us  however  fhlb can legally require six months advance notice of the stock sale before the stock is actually liquidated for cash at its par value 
alternatively  fhlb can redeem  at any time any fhlb stock we own  in excess of the required minimum fhlb stock that needs to be maintained in order to support existing advances 
during  our utilization of fhlb advances increased due to new advances obtained to take advantage of the availability of longer maturity advances at lower rates 
in  we expect to continue to utilize fhlb advances as a funding source to the extent that rates on fhlb advances are more attractive than other sources of liquidity 
the fhlb of chicago paid a annualized dividend in the first  second and fourth quarters of and a annualized third quarter dividend 
fhlb dividends are generally paid one and a half months subsequent to each quarter end 
liquid assets refer to money market assets such as federal funds sold  as well as available for sale securities 
net liquid assets represent the sum of the liquid asset categories less the amount of assets pledged to secure public funds and certain deposits that require collateral 
at december   net liquid assets at the privatebank chicago were million as compared to million at december  at december   net liquid assets at the privatebank st 
louis were million as compared to million at december  
table of contents net cash inflows provided by operations were million for the year ended december  compared to a net inflow of million a year earlier 
net cash outflows from investing activities were million for the year ended december   compared to net cash outflows of million a year earlier 
cash inflows from financing activities for the year ended december  were million compared to a net inflow of million in in the event of short term liquidity needs  the privatebank chicago and the privatebank st 
louis may purchase federal funds from correspondent banks 
in addition  we currently have available borrowing capacity of million under the million credit facility at the holding company 
we utilize this credit facility from time to time for general business purposes 
however  at december   we held no borrowings outstanding under the revolving line 
impact of inflation our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included in this report have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and practices within the banking industry 
under these principles and practices  we are required to measure our financial position in terms of historical dollars  without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike many industrial companies  virtually all of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on our performance than the general level of inflation 
over short periods of time  interest rates may not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as inflation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a continuing part of our financial strategy  we attempt to manage the impact of fluctuations in market interest rates on our net interest income 
this effort entails providing a reasonable balance between interest rate risk  credit risk  liquidity risk and maintenance of yield 
asset liability management policy is established by our investment committee of our board of directors and is monitored by management 
our asset liability management policy sets standards within which we are expected to operate 
these standards include guidelines for exposure to interest rate fluctuations  liquidity  loan limits as a percentage of funding sources  exposure to correspondent banks and brokers  and reliance on non core deposits 
the policy also states our reporting requirements to our board of directors 
the investment policy complements the asset liability management policy by establishing criteria by which we may purchase securities 
these criteria include approved types of securities  brokerage sources  terms of investment  quality standards  and diversification 
we measure the impact of interest rate changes on our income statement through the use of gap analysis 
the gap represents the net position of assets and liabilities subject to repricing in specified time periods 
during any given time period  if the amount of rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of rate sensitive assets  a company would generally be considered negatively gapped and would benefit from falling rates over that period of time 
conversely  a positively gapped company would generally benefit from rising rates 
we have structured our assets and liabilities to mitigate the risk of either a rising or falling interest rate environment 
we manage our gap position at the one year horizon 
depending upon our assessment of economic factors such as the magnitude and direction of projected interest rates over the short and long term  we generally operate within guidelines set by our asset liability management policy and attempt to maximize our returns within an acceptable degree of risk 
our policy states that we shall maintain a rate sensitive assets to rate sensitive liabilities position at the one year horizon between and 
our position at december  was and was within the guidelines of our policy 
we have continued to maintain our gap position set by our policy guidelines and expect to continue to operate in this manner as long as the general rate structure of the economy and our business opportunities remain consistent 
therefore  generally speaking  a short term rise in interest rates will positively impact our earnings  while a short term drop in interest rates would negatively impact our earnings 
interest rate changes do not affect all categories of assets and liabilities equally or simultaneously 
there are other factors that are difficult to measure and predict that would influence the effect of interest rate fluctuations on our income statement 
for example  a rapid drop in interest rates might cause our loans to repay at a more rapid pace and certain mortgage related investments to prepay more quickly than projected 
this could mitigate some of the benefits of falling rates that are expected when negatively gapped 
conversely  a rapid rise in rates could give us an opportunity to increase our margins and stifle the rate of repayment on our mortgage related loans  which would increase our returns

the simulation assumes that assets and liabilities accrue interest on their current pricing basis 
assets and liabilities then reprice based on their terms and remain at that interest rate through the end of the measurement period 
the model attempts to illustrate the potential change in net interest income if the foregoing occurred 
december  december  basis points basis points basis points basis points basis points percentage change in net interest income due to an immediate basis point change in interest rates over a one year time horizon this table shows that if there had been an instantaneous parallel shift in the yield curve of basis points on december   net interest income would decrease by over a one year period 
due to current market interest rates  a basis point shift is presented for december  as a more reasonable illustration of possible rate changes 
the measurement of a basis point instantaneous parallel shift in the yield curve at december  would result in a decline in net interest income of over a one year period 
at december   if there had been an instantaneous parallel shift in the yield curve of  we would have suffered a decline in net interest income of 
conversely  a shift of basis points would increase net interest income over a one year horizon based on december  balances  as compared to measured on the basis of the december  portfolio 
changes in the effect on net interest income from a basis point movement at december   compared to december  are due to the timing and nature of the repricing of rate sensitive assets to rate sensitive liabilities

during  we made asset liability management decisions to become more positively gapped relative to as a result  the positive impact to net interest income for in a basis points scenario is larger for than for through the use of interest rate floors in our loan portfolio  we have added interest rate protection in a basis point scenario and  as a result  the impact to net interest income for is similar to that for the difference in the effect on net interest income at december  as compared to december  is due to the differences in the timing  balances  and current rates versus simulated rates of repricing assets and liabilities 
the preceding sensitivity analysis is based on numerous assumptions including the nature and timing of interest rate levels including the shape of the yield curve  prepayments on loans and securities  changes in deposit levels  pricing decisions on loans and deposits  reinvestment replacement of asset and liability cash flows and others 
while our assumptions are developed based upon current economic and local market conditions  we cannot make any assurances as to the predictive nature of these assumptions including how client preferences or competitor influences might change 
we continue to monitor our gap and rate shock reports to detect changes to our exposure to fluctuating rates 
we have the ability to shorten or lengthen maturities on newly acquired assets  sell investment securities  or seek funding sources with different maturities in order to change our asset and liability structure for the purpose of mitigating the effect of interest rate risk
