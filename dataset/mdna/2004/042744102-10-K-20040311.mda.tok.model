the increase in diluted earnings per share was attributable to a lower number of shares outstanding due to the company s repurchases of its own common stock 
at december   the company s tangible book value per share calculated based on shareholders equity reduced by intangible assets including goodwill  mortgage servicing rights and intangible pension plan assets amounted to  an increase of  or  from year end the increase was primarily attributable to retained earnings offset in part by a decrease in net unrealized gains  net of tax  on securities available for sale and periodic repurchases of the company s common stock

results of operations the following analysis of net interest income  the provision for loan losses  noninterest income  noninterest expense and income taxes  highlights the factors that are primarily responsible for the company s results of operations for and the prior two years 
i 
net interest income tax equivalent basis net interest income represents the difference between interest and dividends earned on loans  securities and other earning assets and interest paid on deposits and other sources of funds 
changes in net interest income result from changes in the level and mix of earning assets and sources of funds volume and changes in the yields earned and interest rates paid rate 
net interest margin is the ratio of net interest income to average earning assets 
net interest income may also be described as the product of average earning assets and the net interest margin 
comparison of net interest income dollars in thousands tax equivalent basis years ended december  change from prior year amount amount interest and dividend income interest expense net interest income on a tax equivalent basis  net interest income was million in  a decrease of thousand  or  from million in this compared to a million  or  increase between and factors contributing to the increase in net interest income are discussed in the following portions of this section bi analysis of changes in net interest income the following table presents net interest income components on a tax equivalent basis and reflects changes between periods attributable to movement in either the average daily balances or average rates for both earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
changes attributable to both volume and rate have been allocated proportionately between the categories

this reflected the fact that the positive impact of an increase in average earning assets which had a million positive impact on net interest income between the two years was more than offset by the negative impact of changes in the interest rate environment which had a million negative impact 
by contrast  the million increase in net interest income between and reflected the fact that the positive impact of an increase in average earning assets which added million to net interest income between the years was reinforced by a positive impact from changing interest rates thousand 
the following items have a major impact on changes in net interest income due to rate general interest rate changes  the ratio of the company s rate sensitive assets to rate sensitive liabilities interest rate sensitivity gap during periods of interest rate changes and the level of nonperforming loans 
key interest rate changes the federal reserve board attempts to influence prevailing federal funds and prime interest rates and sets changes to the federal reserve bank discount rate 
the following chart presents rate changes in recent years federal date discount rate funds rate prime rate june  november  december  november  october  september  august  june  may  april  march  january  january  may  march  february  november  august  june  the company s net interest income  for the past several years  has been very sensitive to changes in interest rates 
as indicated in the table above  prevailing interest rates economy wide began to increase in the second half of through the second half of this marked a turnaround from a long period of flat or slowly declining prevailing interest rates 
the rate hikes had a moderate negative impact on the company s financial results for  which continued to show decreases from prior periods in the average rate earned on earning assets and the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities  as well as decreases in the company s net interest spread and net interest margin 
however  the full and negative impact of rising rates was felt in  when the decrease in net interest income due to rates was significant 
in the first quarter of  after an extended period of stable interest rates and six months of moderate rate increases  the federal reserve board reversed direction and began decreasing short term interest rates rapidly and significantly in response to perceived weakening in the economy 
by december  the total decrease in prevailing short term interest rates for the year was basis points 
after eleven months with no rate changes  the federal reserve board decreased rates another basis points in november as a result  the company experienced a decrease in the cost of deposits in all quarters of  which continued throughout and  although the federal reserve did not reduce short term rates again until the end of although decreases in deposit rates began to be experienced in the first quarter of  the company did not experience a decrease in the average yield in its loan portfolio until the second quarter of yields on the loan portfolio continued to decrease through the remainder of and through all of and see the loan portfolio section in the discussion of financial condition later on in this report  for a more complete analysis of yield trends in the loan portfolio 
as the table above demonstrates  the federal reserve board decreased short term interest rates by basis points in november and again by basis points in june by  however  the cumulative federal reserve rate decreases began to have only a limited impact on the company s deposit rates  because rates on several of the company s deposit products  such as savings and now accounts  were already priced at such low levels that a such a further decrease in rates was not practical or sustainable  although the company did lower rates to a much smaller extent on certain non maturity deposit products 
yields on the loan portfolio  however  did continue to fall in  putting serious pressure on the net interest margin for the first time in years 
thus the decreasing rate environment had a positive impact on net interest income during and  as net interest margins increased both years  but by the low rat e environment eventually had a negative impact on both net interest income and net interest margin 
the net interest margin for was  a decrease of basis points  or  from during the yields on earning assets fell basis points  while the cost of paying liabilities fell only basis points 
the net interest margin for was  an increase of basis points from the margin for the net interest spread between the two years increased by basis points 
as noted  these increases in margin and spread were attributable to the fact that during the company s paying liabilities repriced downward at a faster rate than its earning assets 
another factor reinforcing this development was the relocation of a significant dollar amount of maturing time deposits into other lower cost deposit accounts  a relocation that often accompanies falling interest rates but also often proves temporary 
in both rising and falling rate environments  the company faces significant competitive pricing pressures in its marketplace for both deposits and loans  and thus ultimately both assets and liabilities may be expected to reprice proportionately in response to changes in market rates 
a discussion of the impact on net interest income resulting from changes in interest rates vis a vis the repricing patterns of the company s earning assets and interest bearing liabilities is included later in this report under item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk changes in net interest income due to volume average balances dollars in thousands years ended december  change from prior year amount amount earning assets interest bearing liabilities demand deposits total assets earning assets to total assets vs 
other things being equal  changes in the volume of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities generally will result in corresponding changes in net interest income 
that is  in the normal course of business  as assets and liabilities proportionately increase  so will net interest income 
the recently completed year   was not normal  as discussed above 
moreover  changes due to volume can be enhanced or restricted by shifts within the relative mix of earning assets or interest bearing liabilities between instruments of different rates 
the change in net interest income due to changes in volume was an increase of million in and an increase of million in during average earning assets increased million  an increase of 
average paying liabilities grew at a similar but lower amount  increasing by million  or 
the combined effect of these changes in volume was to increase net interest income by approximately  before giving effect to the negative impact on net interest income resulting from the change in interest rates discussed above 
during  the company experienced its growth in average earning assets primarily within the loan portfolio which accounted for approximately of the increase and secondarily within the investment portfolio approximately 
in comparing year to date average balances  the fastest growing segment of the loan portfolio in was residential real estate loans 
while some of the segment growth represented extensions in connection with refinancing of existing loans  most of the growth was from new mortgage loans 
the average balance of residential mortgage loans increased by over million in  or 
commercial and commercial real estate lending represented the second largest growth area for the company  expanding by over million in  or 
the average balance of indirect consumer lending increased by over million in  or 
indirect loans are primarily auto loans financed through local dealerships from whom the company acquires the dealer paper 
changes in the loan portfolio are discussed in more detail in the following section c 
ii 
loan portfolio 
the company s million growth in average paying liabilities in was experienced primarily in traditional banking deposit products  which increased by million  or  from to  and secondarily in federal home loan bank fhlb borrowings  which increased by million  or  from to the increase in deposit balances during was generated by the company s pre existing branch network  although the company s glens falls national bank and trust company franchise did open its twenty fourth branch in in queensbury  ny 
no other branches were added or acquired in changes in the deposit balances are discussed in more detail in the following section c 
iv 
deposits 
vs 
during  average earning assets increased million  an increase of 
average paying liabilities grew at a somewhat slower pace  increasing by million  or 
the combined effect of these changes in volume was to increase net interest income by approximately  before giving effect to the positive impact on net interest income resulting from the change in interest rates discussed in the previous section 
during  the company experienced its growth in average earning assets primarily within the investment portfolio which accounted for approximately of the increase and secondarily within the loan portfolio approximately 
that is  most of the increase in the sources of funds during was redeployed  at least temporarily  into the investment securities portfolio  awaiting ultimate commitment of those funds into the loan portfolio 
as in  the fastest growing segment of the loan portfolio in was residential real estate million  followed by commercial loans million 
the company s million growth in average paying liabilities in was experienced primarily in traditional banking deposit products  which increased by million  and secondarily in federal home loan bank fhlb borrowings  which increased by million 
these increases were offset  in part  by a million decrease in the average balance of time deposits of  or more 
the increase in deposit balances during was generated by the company s pre existing branch network  although the company s saratoga national bank and trust company franchise did open its third branch the second branch in saratoga springs at the beginning of no other branches were added or acquired in increases in the volume of loans and deposits  as well as yields and costs by type  are discussed later in this report under item c financial condition 
ii 
provision for loan losses and allowance for loan losses management considers its accounting policy relating to the allowance for loan losses to be a critical accounting policy given the uncertainty involved in evaluating the level of the allowance required to cover credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio  and the material effect that such judgments can have on the company s results of operations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  included in item of this report  as well as the discussion below  for a description of the company s policy with respect to estimating the level of the allowance for loan losses 
through the provision for loan losses  an allowance reserve is maintained for the inherent risk of loss in the current portfolio 
actual loan losses are charged against this allowance when loans are deemed uncollectible 
in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  management considers various risk factors influencing asset quality 
the analysis is performed on a loan by loan basis for impaired and large balance loans  and by portfolio type for smaller balance homogeneous loans 
this analysis is based on judgments and estimates and may change in response to economic developments or other conditions that may influence borrowers financial conditions or prospects 
the determination of actual provisions for loan losses on an ongoing basis is largely influenced by the prevailing level of nonperforming loans  the level of loans actually charged off against the allowance for loan losses during the prior periods  recent changes in the mix and volume of loan categories within the loan portfolio and overall changes in the size of the portfolio 
vs 
the quality of the company s loan portfolio remains strong and  to date  has not been negatively affected by the loan growth experienced in recent periods 
at period end  the ratio of nonperforming loans loans days or more past due and accruing interest plus nonaccrual loans as a percentage of total loans was 
for the company 
the september  ratio for the company s peer group was 
at december   nonperforming loans amounted to million  a decrease of thousand  or  from the balance at year end while management believes that the year end allowance of million was adequate under the circumstances  there can be no assurances that future economic or financial developments  including general interest rate increases or a slowdown in the economy  might not lead to a need for increased provisions to the allowance or a higher incidence of loan charge offs 
the provision for loan losses was million for  a decrease of thousand  or  from this reduction was primarily due to the improved asset quality indicators  offset somewhat by the growth in the loan portfolio  as well as consideration of the other noted factors 
during  loan losses charged against the allowance  net of recoveries  were thousand  virtually unchanged from the amount 
the result was a thousand  or  increase in the allowance 
because loans increased by a similar percentage during the year  the company s coverage ratio  its allowance to period end loans  was the same at year end as at year end 
net charge offs as a percentage of average loans outstanding was 
for  down slightly from 
for net charge offs  on an annualized basis  for the company s peer group at september  was 
of average loans  or higher than the company s full year ratio 
if the current economic conditions should worsen  management anticipates that net charge offs may exceed the levels experienced in recent years 
vs 
at december   the allowance for loan losses was million  or  of total loans  as compared to million  or of total loans at december  the allowance for loan losses represented of the amount of nonperforming loans at december   as compared to of nonperforming loans at december  during the second quarter of  the company charged off thousand on one commercial loan 
disregarding this item  net charge offs for increased by thousand  or  over net charge offs as a percentage of average loans outstanding was 
for net charge offs  on an annualized basis  for the company s peer group at december  was 
of average loans  or higher than the company s ratio 
at december   nonperforming loans amounted to million  a decrease of thousand  or  from the balance at year end the decrease in was primarily attributable to one thousand commercial loan that was designated as nonperforming at year end  but was paid off in full during december while nonperforming loans and net loans charged off improved in  as compared to  the continued growth in the loan portfolio resulted in the provision for loan losses remaining consistent with at december   the allowance for loan losses was million  or  of total loans  as compared to million  or of total loans at december  at year end the allowance for loan losses represented of the amount of nonperforming loans  as compared to of nonperforming loans at december  net charge offs as a percentage of average loans outstanding was 
for the provision for loan losses  as a percentage of average loans outstanding was 
for net charge offs  on an annualized basis  for the company s peer group at december  was 
of average loans  or higher than the company s ratio 
vs 
at december   nonperforming loans amounted to million  an increase of million  or  from the balance at year end the increase was primarily attributable to two commercial loans  totaling million  which were placed on nonaccrual status during the fourth quarter of vs 
the provision for loan losses was million for  an increase of thousand  or  from at december   nonperforming loans amounted to million  essentially unchanged from the balance at december  at december   the allowance for loan losses was million  or of total loans 
the allowance for loan losses represented of the amount of nonperforming loans at that date 
during  loan losses charged against the allowance  net of recoveries  were thousand  or  of average loans for the period  an increase of thousand  or  from the prior year amount 
the principal reason for the increase in net loan losses in as compared with was a recovery of thousand in the period related to the final repayment of a large commercial loan 
excluding the large recovery  net loan losses for would have exceeded those for  and would hav e represented 
of average loans 
the provision for loan losses charged to expense for was million  or  of average loans for the period

other income the majority of other ie  noninterest income constitutes fee income from services  principally fees and commissions from fiduciary services  deposit account service charges  computer processing fees and other recurring fee income 
net gains or losses on the sale of securities available for sale is another category of other income 
analysis of other income dollars in thousands years ended december  change from prior year amount amount income from fiduciary activities fees for other services to customers net gains on securities transactions other operating income total other income vs 
total other income increased million  or  from to without regard to net securities transactions  total other income increased by thousand  or  from to for  income from fiduciary activities decreased thousand  or  from  even though total assets under administration and management increased 
at year end  the market value of assets under trust administration and investment management amounted to million  an increase of million  or  from year end however  most of this increase in volume occurred at the end of fiduciary account fees  in general  are tied to the value of assets under administration 
the increase in the market value of assets under trust administration and investment management in reflected the general improvement in the equity markets in the second half of and substantial new volume attributable to business development efforts 
both the third and fourth quarter income from fiduciary activities for was above the respective quarters in income from fiduciary activities includes income from funds under investment management in the company advised north country funds  which include the north country equity growth fund ncegx and the north country intermediate bond fund ncbdx 
on a combined basis  these funds reached a market value of million and million at december  and  respectively 
the funds were introduced in march  and are advised by the company s subsidiary  north country investment advisors  inc currently  the funds are owned almost entirely by qualified employee benefit plan accounts 
the company also offers these funds on a retail basis through its branches 
included as an investor in the funds is the company s pension plan  which owns shares in the funds with a market value of million and million at december  and  respectively 
fees for other services to customers include deposit account service charges  credit card and debit card merchant processing fees  safe deposit box fees and loan servicing fees 
these fees amounted to million in  an increase of thousand  or  from the increase was primarily attributable to growth in the number of transaction deposit accounts and the related service charges on those accounts and an increase in merchant credit card processing income 
for  total other income included securities gains of thousand on the sale of million of securities available for sale 
during the second and third quarters of  the company experienced above average amounts of prepayments of mortgage backed securities and cmo s in the available for sale portfolio 
the company had purchased many of these securities at premiums since the underlying mortgages were written during periods when mortgage rates were higher than the recent extended period of historically low rates 
the higher than anticipated prepayment levels had the effect of accelerating amortization of the premiums an offset against interest income in the portfolio  ultimately reducing the yield on the portfolio below the projected yield 
the primary purpose of the sales in the available for sale portfolio was to extend and restructure the maturities of certain investments with shorter remaining lives 
the following table presents sales in the available for sale portfolio and purchases in the available for sale and the held to maturity portfolios during total purchases in the table below include million of loan securitizations  which have not been included in the total listed in the consolidated statement of cash flows for purchases of securities available for sale of  as the securitization was a non cash transaction 
investment sales and purchases in thousands available for sale portfolio st quarter nd quarter rd quarter th quarter proceeds from sales collateralized mortgage obligations other mortgage backed securities us agency securities state and municipal obligations other total sales purchases collateralized mortgage obligations other mortgage backed securities us agency securities state and municipal obligations other total purchases other operating income includes net gains on the sale of loans and other real estate owned  if any  as well as other miscellaneous revenues 
for  other operating income increased thousand  or  from during  the company sold million of newly originated loans primarily residential real estate loans to the secondary market 
the net gains of thousand were due  in part  to the fact that market interest rates on residential real estate loans kept falling during the period  but primarily because the company was able to write loans with yields slightly higher than those required by the secondary market 
in  the company recognized thousand in gains on the sale of loans 
the period also included a one time benefit of thousand from the demutualization of an insurance company for the company s group employee insurance trust and a thousand recovery related to the former ver mont operations 
credit card processing income decreased by thousand from to as the company completed its exit from that business in vs 
total other income increased thousand  or  from to without regard to net securities transactions  total other income was million for and million for  an increase of thousand  or 
for  income from fiduciary activities decreased thousand  or  from  primarily as a result of a decrease in assets under administration and management from declining equity markets between the two years 
at year end  the market value of assets under trust administration and investment management amounted to million  a decrease of million  or  from year end partially offsetting the negative effect on fiduciary income from the decline in the equity markets during  was an increase in the number of accounts under administration during the year 
fiduciary account fees  in general  are tied to the value of assets under administration 
income from fiduciary activities includes advisory income from the company s subsidiary  north country investment advisors  which advises the north country equity growth fund ncegx and the north country intermediate bond fund ncbdx 
fees for other services to customers include deposit account service charges  credit card and debit card merchant processing fees  safe deposit box fees and loan servicing fees 
these fees amounted to million in  an increase of thousand  or  from over half of the increase was attributable to increases in deposit service charges 
an increase in credit card and debit card merchant processing fees also made a significant contribution to the total increase in fees for other services to customers 
during  the company realized net securities gains of thousand on the sale of million from its available for sale portfolio 
the primary purpose of the sales was to restructure the maturity profile of the investment portfolio 
this represented a decline of thousand from net securities gains of thousand in other operating income includes net gains on the sale of loans and other real estate owned  if any  as well as other miscellaneous revenues 
for  other operating income increased thousand  or 
the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in data processing servicing fee income received from one upstate new york bank  a one time benefit of thousand from the demutualization of an insurance company for the company s group employee insurance trust and a thousand recovery related to the former vermont operations 
iv 
other expense other ie  noninterest expense is a means of measuring the delivery cost of services  products and business activities of the company 
the key components of other expense are presented in the following table 
analysis of other expense dollars in thousands years ended december  change from prior year amount amount salaries and employee benefits occupancy expense of premises  net furniture and equipment expense other operating expense total other expense vs 
other expense for amounted to million  an increase of million  or  from one comparative measure of operating expenses for financial institutions is the efficiency ratio 
the efficiency ratio a ratio where lower is better is calculated as the ratio of other expense to the sum of tax equivalent net interest income and other income 
excluded from the calculation are goodwill amortization and any net securities gains or losses 
for  the efficiency ratio for the company was  an increase from the ratio of 
the company s ratio  however  compared favorably to the year to date ratio for the company s peer group of as of september  for information on the calculation of the company s efficiency ratios on a quarterly and annual basis  see pages and of this report 
also see the discussion on page regarding use of non gaap financial measures 
salaries and employee benefits expense increased thousand  or  from to the increase in salary expense for was over due to merit increases  as well as the hiring of additional employees in principally to staff the new queensbury  new york office of glens falls national bank 
this was offset  in part  by decreases in pension expense due primarily to the conversion to a cash balance plan and a decrease in the accrual for incentive compensation 
on an annualized basis  the ratio of total personnel expense salaries and employee benefits to average assets was for  basis points less than the ratio for the company s peer group of at september  occupancy expense increased thousand  or  from to most of the increase was attributable to increased costs of insurance  maintenance and real estate taxes 
furniture and equipment expense increased by thousand  or  from to the increase was spread among all areas  including maintenance contracts  data processing and depreciation expenses 
other operating expense increased thousand  or  from to the increase was distributed among all categories of other operating expense 
vs 
other expense for amounted to million  an increase of thousand  or  from this comparison was significantly affected by a change in accounting principles between the two periods 
the significant change was the discontinuance in of goodwill amortization upon the adoption of sfas no 
 retroactive to january  goodwill amortization for was thousand  but was for disregarding goodwill amortization  the increase in other expense between and would have been substantially higher  specifically  million  or a  year to year increase 
the efficiency ratio of was an improvement from the ratio of 
the company s ratio also compared favorably to the ratio for the company s peer group of for the year ending december  for information on the calculation of the company s efficiency ratios on a quarterly and annual basis  see pages and of this report 
also see the discussion on page regarding use of non gaap financial measures 
salaries and employee benefits increased million  or  from to salaries increased thousand  or 
the increase was attributable to normal merit pay increases  as well as to the hiring of additional employees late in principally to staff the new west avenue office of saratoga national bank and trust company in saratoga springs  new york and the company s new insurance agency subsidiary 
employee benefits increased thousand  or during the period 
in  all categories of employee benefits experienced increases from  except incentive compensation  which decreased slightly 
the most significant increase to employee benefits was an increase in expenses for the company s defined benefit pension plan 
during  the company adopted a cash balance plan for all new employees 
current employees were offered the opportunity to switch to the cas h balance plan or to remain with the prior plan  under which retirement benefits are calculated on a final pay formula 
over of current employees elected to switch to the cash balance plan 
occupancy expense increased thousand  or  from to most of the increase was attributable to increased costs of insurance and real estate taxes 
furniture and equipment expense decreased slightly by thousand  or  from to other operating expense increased thousand  or  from to  without considering goodwill amortization  which was included in other operating expense in but not in due to a change in accounting principles  as discussed above 
v 
income taxes the following table sets forth the company s provision for income taxes and effective tax rates for the periods presented 
income taxes and effective rates dollars in thousands years ended december  change from prior year amount amount provision for income taxes effective tax rate the provisions for federal and state income taxes amounted to million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the effective income tax rates for  and were  and  respectively 
the change in the effective tax rates from to and from to was primarily attributable to proportionate changes in taxable income over the level of tax exempt income

investment portfolio investment securities are classified as held to maturity  trading  or available for sale  depending on the purposes for which such securities were acquired and are being held 
securities held to maturity are debt securities that the company has both the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity  such securities are stated at amortized cost 
debt and equity securities that are bought and held principally for the purpose of sale in the near term are classified as trading securities and are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings 
debt and equity securities not classified as either held to maturity or trading securities are classified as available for sale and are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported net of taxes in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss

loan portfolio the amounts and respective percentages of loans outstanding represented by each principal category on the dates indicated were as follows a 
distribution of loans dollars in thousands december  amount amount amount amount amount commercial  financial and agricultural real estate commercial real estate construction real estate residential indirect loans other installment loans to individuals total loans allowance for loan losses total loans  net indirect loans in the several years preceding the third quarter of  the indirect consumer loan portfolio consisting principally of auto loans financed through local dealerships where the company acquires the dealer paper was the fastest growing segment of the company s loan portfolio  both in terms of absolute dollar amount and as a percentage of the overall portfolio 
over the subsequent quarters  this segment of the portfolio ceased to grow in absolute terms and decreased as a percentage of the overall portfolio 
this flattening out of indirect loan totals was largely the result of aggressive campaigns of zero rate and other subsidized financing commenced by the auto manufacturers in the fall of during the fourth quarter of  and for the first two quarters of  the indirect portfolio experienced a small amount of growth as the company became more rate competitive  but the level of indirect loans was flat for the third quarter of and decreased by million during the fourth quarter of however  indirect loans still represent the second largest category of loans in the company s loan portfolio  and any developments threatening the indirect loan business generally may be expected to have a negative impact on the company due its to reliance on such loans 
if auto manufacturers continue to offer heavily subsidized financing programs  the indirect loan portfolio is likely to continue to experience rate pressure and limited  if any  overall growth 
residential real estate loans residential real estate loans represented the largest segment of the company s loan portfolio at december   at of loans at year end 
this was the fastest growing segment in the company s loan portfolio for the first  third and fourth quarters of and the second fastest for the second quarter of the period of strong demand for residential real estate loans  which began when rates started falling in  began to weaken in the third and fourth quarters of  as refinancing activity  driven by the level or increasing interest rate environment  began to slow down 
during the company sold with servicing retained million of low rate residential real estate loans 
the level of the portfolio was also impacted by the securitization of million of mortgage loans cited earlier in this report 
in effect  the securitized loans were not sold but merely transferred to the company s securities available for sale portfolio 
the company also securitized million of mortgage loans in commercial and commercial real estate loans the company continued to experience strong to moderate demand for commercial loans in  a continuing trend that has persisted for several years  as commercial and commercial real estate loans have grown each year for the past five years  both in dollar amount and as a percentage of the overall loan portfolio 
the following table indicates the changing mix in the company s loan portfolio by including the quarterly average balances for the company s significant loan products for the past five quarters

there is a time lag  however  between the federal reserve s changes in prevailing rates and the impact of those changes on the company s loan portfolio 
as discussed above in this report in the section entitled changes in net interest income due to rate  prevailing interest rates  after increasing steadily throughout  decreased in  and in response to the federal reserve board s rate cutting actions during all four quarters of  in november and again in june the yield on the company s loan portfolio was affected by these rate changes  although the decrease in average yields on loans and other earning assets lagged behind the decrease in average rates paid on deposits  leading to exp ansion in the net interest margin in and and ultimately a contraction in as loan yields continued to fall while deposit rates bottomed out 
many of the loans in the commercial portfolio have variable rates tied to prime or us treasury indices 
additionally  there is a significant amount of cash flow from normal amortization and prepayments in all loan categories  and this cash ultimately reprices at current rates as new loans are generated at the lower current yields 
the following table indicates the respective maturities and repricing structure of the company s commercial  financial and agricultural loans and its real estate construction loans at december  for purposes of determining relevant maturities  loans are assumed to mature at but not before their scheduled repayment dates as required by contractual terms 
demand loans and overdrafts are included in the within year maturity category 
all of the real estate construction loans are for single family houses where the company has made a commitment for permanent financing 
maturity and repricing of commercial loans in thousands within year after but within years after years total commercial  financial and agricultural real estate construction total fixed interest rates variable interest rates total commitments and lines of credit stand by letters of credit represent extensions of credit granted in the normal course of business  which are not reflected in the financial statements because the commitments were not funded at period end 
as of december   the total contingent liability for standby letters of credit amounted to million 
in addition to these instruments  the company has issued lines of credit to customers  including home equity lines of credit  commitments for residential and commercial construction loans and other personal and commercial lines of credit  which also may be unfunded or only partially funded from time to time 
commercial lines  generally issued for a period of one year  are usually extended to provide for the working capital requirements of the borrower 
at december   the company had outstanding unfunded loan commitments in the aggregate amount of approximately million 
b 
risk elements nonaccrual  past due and restructured loans the company designates loans as nonaccrual when the payment of interest and or principal is due and unpaid for a designated period generally days or when the likelihood of the full repayment of principal and interest is  in the opinion of management  uncertain 
under the uniform retail credit classification and account management policy  established by banking regulators  fixed maturity consumer loans must generally be charged off no later than when days past due 
open end credits and residential real estate loans should be charged off no later than when days past due 
commercial loans are evaluated for charge off on a loan by loan basis 
there were no material commitments to lend additional funds on outstanding nonaccrual loans at december  loans past due days or more and still accruing interest  as identified in the table presented on page under the heading summary of the allowance and provision for loan losses  are those loans which were contractually past due days or more but because of expected repayments  were still accruing interest 
sfas no 
requires that all impaired loans  except for large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans  be measured based on i the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  ii the loan s observable market price or iii the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
the company applies the provisions of sfas no 
to all impaired commercial and commercial real estate loans over thousand  and to all restructured loans 
allowances for losses for the remaining smaller balance loans are evaluated under sfas no 
under the provisions of sfas no 
 the company determines impairment for collateralized loans based on fair value of the collateral less estimated cost to sell 
for other loans  impairment is determined by comparing the recorded value of the loan to the present value of the expected cash flows  discounted at the loan s effectiv e interest rate 
the company determines the interest income recognition method for impaired loans on a loan by loan basis 
based upon the borrowers payment histories and cash flow projections  interest recognition methods include full accrual or cash basis 
during one commercial loan was considered impaired under sfas no

this loan was included in nonaccrual loans in the schedule of nonperforming loans 
at december   nonperforming loans amounted to million  a decrease of thousand  or  from the balance at year end the decrease was primarily attributable to one thousand commercial loan designated nonperforming at year end  which was paid off by the borrower during december total nonperforming loans at year end represented

at december   two commercial loans were considered impaired loans under sfas no 
with a recorded investment of million  an allowance for loan losses of thousand and a net carrying amount of thousand 
these loans were included in nonaccrual loans in the schedule of nonperforming loans above 
at december   nonperforming loans amounted to million  an increase of million  or  from the balance at year end the increase was attributable to the two impaired commercial loans described in the preceding paragraph  which were placed on nonaccrual status during the fourth quarter of the allowance for loan losses  at december   included specific impairment allowances of thousand for these two loans 
total nonperforming loans at year end represented 
of period end loans  an increase from 
at year end the ratio of nonperforming loans to average loans for the company s peer group at december  was  or higher than the company s ratio at december  during income recognized on year end balances of nonaccrual loans was thousand 
income that would have been recognized during that period on nonaccrual loans if all such loans had been current in accordance with their original terms and had been outstanding throughout the period or since origination if held for part of the period was thousand 
potential problem loans on at least a quarterly basis  the company applies an internal credit quality rating system to commercial loans that are either past due or fully performing loans which may exhibit certain characteristics that could reflect a potential weakness 
loans are placed on nonaccrual status when the likely amount of future principal and interest payments are expected to be less than the contractual amounts  even if such loans are not days past due 
because of this approach toward placing commercial loans on nonaccrual status  the company normally does not identify any significant number of potential problem loans in its portfolio that do not otherwise meet one of the classifications discussed above eg  nonaccrual  troubled debt restructurings 
at year end  the company had no such additional potential problem loans 
at year end the company had identified only one credit that  although still accruing interest  exhibit ed such significant weakness as to warrant mention as a potential problem 
in the company up graded the status of that borrower and no longer considers the credit to be classified as a potential problem loan 
in the first quarter of  a commercial borrower announced plans to discontinue some or all aspects of its business operations 
the borrower was then indebted to the company in the aggregate amount of million through three separate loans 
during the third quarter of  two loans totaling million were repaid in full through liquidation of the underlying collateral 
the third loan with a balance of thousand as of december   is secured by commercial real estate having an estimated market value significantly in excess of the loan balance 
there are no commitments to extend additional credit to the borrower 
management believes that the risk of credit loss to this borrower  at this time  is very limited and the outstanding loan remains on accrual status 
the balance of other non current loans to which interest income was being accrued ie loans days past due as defined in bank regulatory agency guidance totaled million at december  and represented of loans outstanding at that date  as compared to approximately million  or of loans at december  these non current loans at december  were composed of approximately million of consumer loans  principally indirect motor vehicle loans  thousand of residential real estate loans  thousand of commercial real estate loans and thousand of commercial loans 
the overall level of the company s performing loans which demonstrate characteristics of potential weakness from time to time is for the most part dependent on economic conditions in northeastern new york state 
in general  the economy in the company s geographic market area was relatively strong in the period 
although the us experienced a mild recession in which continued throughout and into  the economic downturn was not as severe in northeastern new york state 
in the capital district in and around albany and in the area north of the capital district  which are the company s principal service areas  unemployment remained below the national average 
foreign outstandings none loan concentrations the loan portfolio is well diversified 
there are no concentrations of credit that exceed of the portfolio  other than the general categories reported in the preceding section iia of this report

summary of loan loss experience the company monitors credit quality through a continuous review of the entire loan portfolio 
all significant loans primarily commercial and commercial real estate loans are reviewed at least semi annually  and those under special supervision are reviewed at least quarterly 
additionally  regulatory examiners perform periodic examinations of the company s loan portfolios and report on these examinations to management 
the boards of directors of the company s subsidiary banks  upon recommendations from management  determine the extent of charge offs and have the final decision making responsibility in authorizing charge offs 
through the provision for loan losses  an allowance reserve is maintained for probable loan losses 
actual loan losses are charged against this allowance when they are identified 
in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  management considers various risk factors influencing asset quality 
the analysis is performed on a loan by loan basis for impaired and large balance loans  and by portfolio type for smaller balance homogeneous loans 
this analysis is based on judgments and estimates and may change in response to economic developments or other conditions that may influence borrowers economic outlook and financial condition and prospects 
in addition to conclusions regarding the adequacy of the allowance  the provision for loan losses is influenced by the total size of the loan portfolio  the level of nonperforming loans  by the level of loans actually charged off against the allowance during prior periods and the change in the mix of loan categories within the loan portfolio 
the table in part ii  item bii 
provision for loan losses and allowance for loan losses presents a summary of the activity in the company s allowance for loan losses 
allocation of the allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is a general allowance applicable to losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
for internal operating purposes  the allowance is not allocated among loan categories 
in the following table  the allowance has been allocated among the loan categories indicated solely for purposes of complying with disclosure requirements of the securities and exchange commission 
however  this allocation should not be interpreted as a projection of i likely sources of future charge offs  ii likely proportional distribution of future charge offs among loan categories or iii likely amounts of future charge offs 
since management regards the allowance as a general balance and has assigned unallocated values to categories in the table solely for purposes of compliance with the disclosure requirements  the amounts presented do not represent the total balance available to absorb future charge offs that might occur within the designated categories 
on a quarterly basis  management risk classifies delinquent or problem loans in the commercial  commercial real estate and real estate construction portfolios as special mention  substandard  doubtful or loss 
reserves are assigned to all loans by either a specific allocation  a risk classified loss percentage or by a percentage applied to individual categories of loans

deposit portfolio quarterly average deposit balances dollars in thousands quarter ending dec sep jun mar dec demand deposits interest bearing demand deposits regular and money market savings time deposits of  or more other time deposits total deposits the company typically experiences seasonally high balances in the first and last quarters of the year due to the cyclicality of municipal deposits  which typically are included in either interest bearing demand deposits or time deposits of  or more during the period of very low interest rates  these deposits were primarily maintained in interest bearing demand deposits 
between the fourth quarters of and  balances increased million  or 
all categories of non maturity deposits increased between the two comparative quarters  except for other time deposits 
as is typical in falling rate environments  many depositors placed maturing time deposits in non maturity deposits  beginning in the third and fourth quarters of and into and as well  presumably as a temporary investment pending a return to rising rates 
this was also true for the company s municipal depositors who also maintained high balances in now accounts at both year end and the total quarterly average balances as a percentage of total deposits are illustrated in the table below 
percentage of total quarterly average deposits quarter ending dec sep jun mar dec demand deposits interest bearing demand deposits regular and money market savings time deposits of  or more other time deposits total deposits time deposits of  or more are to a large extent comprised of municipal deposits and are obtained on a competitive bid basis 
quarterly cost of deposits quarter ending dec sep jun mar dec demand deposits interest bearing demand deposits regular and money market savings time deposits of  or more other time deposits total deposits including non interest bearing in general  rates paid by the company on its various types of deposit accounts are influenced by the rates being offered or paid by its competitors  which in turn are influenced by prevailing interest rates in the economy as impacted from time to time by the actions of the federal reserve board 
there typically is a time lag between the federal reserve s actions undertaken to influence rates and the actual repricing of deposit liabilities by the company  but the lag is shorter in duration than the lag for loans and other earning assets 
as a result of the federal reserve rate decreases in the to period  the company experienced a decrease in the cost of deposits throughout the period 
the cost of deposits during the fourth quarter of was at its lowest point in many years 
if  as many believe  the economy will take several more months or longer to fully recover  the company may continue to experience downward pressures on its net interest spread and net interest margin  if loan yields continue to trend downward while deposit rates remain at historic lows

liquidity liquidity is measured by the ability of the company to raise cash when it needs it at a reasonable cost 
the company must be capable of meeting expected and unexpected obligations to its customers at any time 
given the uncertain nature of customer demands as well as the need to maximize earnings  the company must have available reasonably priced sources of funds  on and off balance sheet  that can be accessed quickly in time of need 
securities available for sale represent a primary source of balance sheet cash flow 
certain investment securities are selected at purchase as available for sale based on their marketability and collateral value  as well as their yield and maturity 
in addition to liquidity arising from balance sheet cash flows  the company has supplemented liquidity with additional off balance sheet sources such as credit lines with the federal home loan bank fhlb 
the company has established overnight and day term lines of credit with the fhlb each in the amount of million at december  there were no advances under either line at december  if advanced  such lines of credit are collateralized by mortgage backed securities  loans and fhlb stock 
in addition  the company has in place modest borrowing facilities from correspondent banks and also has identified wholesale and retail repurchase agreements and brokered certificates of deposit as appropriate off balance sheet sources of funding accessible in relatively short time periods 
also  the company s lead bank has established a borrowing facility with the federal reserve bank of new york  pledging certain consumer loans as collateral for potential discount window advances 
at december   the amount available under this facility was million  but there were no advances outstanding at december  the company measures and monitors its basic liquidity as a ratio of liquid assets to short term liabilities  both with and without the availability of borrowing arrangements 
based on the level of cash flows from the company s investment securities portfolio  particularly mortgage backed s ecurities  and from maturing loans in its portfolio  the company s stable core deposit base and its significant borrowing capacity  the company believes that its liquidity is sufficient to meet any reasonably likely events or occurrences

capital resources and dividends shareholders equity was million at december   an increase of million  or  from the prior year end 
the increase in shareholders equity during primarily reflected million of retained earnings after dividends offset  in part  by a decrease of million related to net unrealized gains and losses net of tax on securities available for sale and by million of periodic repurchases of the company s common stock 
in  the company  through a newly formed subsidiary business trust  privately placed million in capital securities with several institutional investors  and in formed a similar trust to place million of capital securities with one private investor 
the proceeds from these offerings reflected as junior subordinated obligations issued to unconsolidated subsidiary trusts in the company s consolidated balance sheet as of december  these capital securities have certain features that make them an alternative funding vehicle 
both issues of capital securities qualify  to date  as regulatory capital under the capital adequacy guidelines discussed below 
see note to the audited financial statements included in part ii  item for a further description 
the maintenance of appropriate capital levels is a management priority 
overall capital adequacy is monitored on an ongoing basis by management and reviewed regularly by the board of directors 
the company s principal capital planning goal is to provide an adequate return to shareholders while retaining a sufficient base to provide for future expansion and comply with all regulatory standards 
one set of regulatory capital guidelines applicable to the company and the subsidiary banks are the so called risk based capital measures 
under these measures  as established by federal bank regulators  the minimum ratio of tier capital to risk weighted assets is and the minimum ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets is 
for the company  tier capital is comprised of common shareholders equity and capital securities issued by the company s unconsolidated subsidiary  a statutory business trust see the second previous paragraph less intangible assets 
total capital  for this risk based capital standard  includes tier capital plus other qualifying regulatory capital  including a portion of the company s allowance for loan losses 
currently  banking regulators allow trust preferred securities as a component of tier capital  but that position is being evaluated due to fin the company cannot predict whether trust preferred securities will continue to be allowed as a component of tier capital in future periods 
in addition to the risk based capital measures  the federal bank regulatory agencies require banks and bank holding companies to satisfy another capital guideline  the tier leverage ratio tier capital to quarterly average assets less intangible assets 
the minimum tier leverage ratio is for the most highly rated institutions 
the guidelines provide that other institutions should maintain a tier leverage ratio that is at least to higher than the minimum level for top rated institutions 
the table below sets forth the capital ratios of the company and its subsidiary banks as of december  capital ratios arrow gfnb snb risk based tier ratio total risk based capital ratio tier leverage ratio at december   the company and both of its subsidiary banks exceeded the minimum capital ratios established by these guidelines  and qualified as well capitalized  the highest category  in the capital classification scheme set by federal bank regulatory agencies see the further discussion under supervision and regulation in part i item c of this report 
the source of funds for the payment of shareholder dividends by the company consists primarily of dividends declared and paid to the company by its bank subsidiaries 
there are various legal and regulatory limitations applicable to the payment of dividends to the company by its bank subsidiaries 
as of december   under this statutory limitation  the maximum amount that could have been paid by the bank subsidiaries to the company  without special regulatory approval  was approximately million

off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of operations  the company engages in a variety of financial transactions that  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  are not recorded in the financial statements  or are recorded in amounts that differ from the notional amounts 
these transactions involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit  interest rate  and liquidity risk 
such transactions are used by the company for general corporate purposes or for customer needs 
corporate purpose transactions are used to help manage credit  interest rate  and liquidity risk or to optimize capital

net interest margin is the ratio of tax equivalent net interest income to average earning assets 
see use of non gaap financial measures on page item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in addition to credit risk in the company s loan portfolio and liquidity risk  discussed earlier  the company s business activities also generate market risk 
market risk is the possibility that changes in future market rates or prices will make the company s position less valuable 
the ongoing monitoring and management of risk is an important component of the company s asset liability management process  which is governed by policies that are reviewed and approved annually by the board of directors 
the board of directors delegates responsibility for carrying out asset liability oversight and control to management s asset liability committee alco 
in this capacity alco develops guidelines and strategies impacting the company s asset liability profile based upon estimated market risk sensitivity  policy limits and overall market interest rate levels and trends 
the company does not make use of derivatives  such as interest rate swaps  in its risk management process 
interest rate risk is the most significant market risk affecting the company 
interest rate risk is the exposure of the company s net interest income to changes in interest rates 
interest rate risk is directly related to the different maturities and repricing characteristics of interest bearing assets and liabilities  as well as to the risk of prepayment of loans and early withdrawal of time deposits  and the fact that the speed and magnitude of responses to interest rate changes varies by product 
the alco utilizes the results of a detailed and dynamic simulation model to quantify the estimated exposure of net interest income to sustained interest rate changes 
while alco routinely monitors simulated net interest income sensitivity over a rolling two year horizon  it also utilizes additional tools to monitor potential longer term interest rate risk 
the simulation model captures the impact of changing interest rates on the interest income received and interest expense paid on all interest sensitive assets and liabilities reflected on the company s consolidated balance sheet 
this sensitivity analysis is compared to alco policy limits which specify a maximum tolerance level for net interest income exposure over a one year horizon  assuming no balance sheet growth and a basis point upward and downward shift in interest rates  where interest bearing assets and liabilities reprice at their earliest possible repricing date 
however  due to the low level of interest rates at december   the downward shift was calculated using a basis point shift in interest rates 
a parallel and pro rata shift in rates over a month period is assumed 
applying the simulation model analysis as of december   a basis point increase in interest rates demonstrated a decrease in net interest income  and a basis point decrease in interest rates demonstrated a decrease in net interest income 
these amounts were within the company s alco policy limits 
historically there has existed an inverse relationship between changes in prevailing rates and net interest income  reflecting the fact that the company s liabilities and sources of funds generally reprice more quickly than its earning assets 
however  during this period of very low interest rates the company is also adversely impacted by a continued decline in prevailing rates since there is very little likelihood that they would be reflected in the short or long run by a comparable downward adjustment of deposit rates 
the preceding sensitivity analysis does not represent a company forecast and should not be relied upon as being indicative of expected operating results 
as noted elsewhere in this report  the federal reserve board took certain actions in the to period to decrease prevailing short term interest rates 
management believes it likely that rates will begin to rise later in and in management believes that an extended period of flat interest rates will continue to have a negative impact on net interest margin as asset repricing continues downward while deposit repricing abates  and that an increase in prevailing interest rates will have a short to medium term negative impact on net interest margin and net interest income as well 
management is not able to predict with certainty what the magnitude of these effects would be 
the hypothetical estimates underlying the sensitivity analysis are based upon numerous assumptions including the nature and timing of interest rate levels including yield curve shape  prepayments on loans and securities  deposit decay rates  pricing decisions on loans and deposits  reinvestment replacement of asset and liability cash flows  and others 
while assumptions are developed based upon current economic and local market conditions  management cannot make any assurance as to the predictive nature of these assumptions including how customer preferences or competitor influences might change 
also  as market conditions vary from those assumed in the sensitivity analysis  actual results will differ due to prepayment refinancing levels likely deviating from those assumed  the varying impact of interest rate changes on caps or floors on adjustable rate assets  the potential effect of changing debt service levels on customers with adjustable rate loans  depositor early withdrawals and product preference changes  unanticipated shifts in the yield curve and other internal external variables 
furthermore  the sensitivity analysis does not reflect actions that alco might take in responding to or anticipating changes in interest rates
