overview founded in  we are a provider of data conversion and digital mapping services to users of customized geographic information systems 
our independent auditors  pannell kerr forster of texas  pc  issued a going concern qualification on our financial statements for the fiscal year ended september  the going concern qualification  which expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern  is based on the significant operating losses reported in fiscal and  and a lack of external financing 
our former independent auditors  kpmg  llp  issued a going concern qualification on our financial statements for the fiscal years ended september     and  based on the significant operating losses reported in those fiscal years and a lack of external financing to fund working capital and debt requirements 
the conversion of the restructured note could have a material impact on our results for the first quarter of management is currently evaluating the financial statement impact of the conversion 
see note and note to the consolidated financial statements 
we experience yearly and quarterly fluctuations in production costs  salaries  wages and related benefits and subcontractor costs 
these costs may vary as a percentage of sales from period to period 
in september  our five year exclusive supply agreement with infotech enterprises  ltd  an india based company  to provide production capacity for data conversion and other related services expired 
we utilized infotech to provide more than of our offshore subcontractor services which work constitutes less than of our total production costs 
we will continue to utilize infotech for offshore conversion capacity but will also engage alternate sources of offshore subcontractor services in india 
this may increase our cost of offshore services in the short term as we train a new supplier 
we intend to continue to utilize offshore subcontractors for a large percentage of certain data entry production work in fiscal to reduce production costs and develop new services 
our backlog has been impacted by changes in macroeconomic and industry market conditions 
these conditions  first encountered in fiscal and which have continued through fiscal  include interest rate and exchange rate stability  public sector spending levels  and the size of investment spending 
we believe these adverse market conditions were and continue to be primarily caused by the recessionary economic climate  consolidation in the utility industry  and increased competition from companies with offshore operations 
backlog increases when new contracts are signed and decreases as revenues are recognized 
the changes in macroeconomic and industry market conditions have resulted in a reduction of the execution of new contracts and the renewal of expiring contracts  thus causing a decrease in our backlog 
at september   backlog was million  million of which we expect to fill in fiscal at september   backlog was million 
a number of the projects awarded to us are greater than million or longer than two years in duration  which can increase risk due to inflation  as well as changes in customer expectations and funding availability 
our contracts are generally terminable on short notice  and while we rarely experience such termination  there is no assurance that we will receive all of the revenue anticipated under signed contracts 
see item business risk factors our customer contracts may be adversely modified  changed or terminated prior to the expiration of the contract terms 
critical accounting policies revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue using the percentage of completion method of accounting on a cost to cost basis 
for each contract  an estimate of total production costs is determined and these estimates are reevaluated monthly 
the estimation process requires substantial judgments on the costs over the life of the contract  which are inherently uncertain 
the duration of the contracts and the technical challenges included in certain contracts affect our ability to estimate costs precisely 
production costs consist of 
table of contents internal costs  primarily salaries and wages  and external costs  primarily subcontractor costs 
internal and external production costs may vary considerably among projects and during the course of completion of each project 
at each accounting period  the percentage of completion is based on production costs incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated production costs for each of the contracts 
this percentage is then multiplied by the contract s total value to calculate the sales revenue to be recognized 
the percentage of completion is affected by any factors which influence either the estimate of future productivity or the production cost per hour used to determine future costs 
we recognize losses on contracts in the period such loss is determined 
sales and marketing expenses associated with obtaining contracts are expensed as incurred 
if we underestimate the total cost to complete a project we would recognize a disproportionately high amount of revenue in the earlier stages of the contract  which would result in disproportionately high profit margins in the same period 
conversely  if we overestimate the cost to complete a project  a disproportionately low amount of revenue would be recognized in the early stages of a contract 
while our contracts generally contain termination clauses they also provide for reimbursement of costs incurred to date in the event of termination 
valuation of accounts receivable 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
management routinely assesses the financial condition of our customers and the markets in which these customers participate 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances might be required 
litigation 
we are subject to various claims  lawsuits and administrative proceedings that arise from the ordinary course of business 
liabilities and costs associated with these matters require estimates and judgment based on professional knowledge and experience of management and our legal counsel 
when estimates of our exposure for claims or pending or threatened litigation matters meet the criteria of sfas no 
 amounts are recorded as charges to operations 
the ultimate resolution of any exposure may change as further facts and circumstances become known 
income taxes 
the year was the only year out of the last three in which we have reported net income and taxable income  and we reported a net loss in fiscal and the current and prior year losses have generated a sizeable federal tax net operating loss  or nol  carryforward which totals approximately million as of september  us generally accepted accounting principles require that we record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset associated with this nol if it is more likely than not that we will not be able to utilize it to offset future taxes 
due to the size of the nol carryforward in relation to our recent history of unprofitable operations and due to the continuing uncertainties surrounding our future operations as discussed above  we have not recognized any of this net deferred tax asset 
we currently provide for income taxes only to the extent that we expect to pay cash taxes primarily state taxes and the federal alternative minimum tax on current taxable income 
it is possible  however  that we could be profitable in the future at levels which cause management to conclude that it is more likely than not that we will realize all or a portion of the nol carryforward 
upon reaching such a conclusion  we would immediately record the estimated net realizable value of the deferred tax asset at that time and would then provide for income taxes at a rate equal to our combined federal and state effective rates  which would approximate under current tax rates 
subsequent revisions to the estimated net realizable value of the deferred tax asset could cause our provision for income taxes to vary significantly from period to period  although our cash tax payments would remain unaffected until the benefit of the nol is utilized

table of contents fiscal years ended september  and revenues 
we recognize revenues as services are performed 
revenues recorded in a period are reported net of adjustments to reflect changes in estimated profitability of each project 
revenues decreased or million to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the decrease in revenues is due to a lower number of active contracts in the fiscal period 
the level of new contract signings in fiscal and was lower than in previous years and  as a result  revenues have decreased as well 
we believe this decrease in contract signings is attributable to lower demand for and reduced spending levels in information technology products and services both in general and specific to the gis industry 
salaries  wages and benefits 
salaries  wages and benefits include employee compensation for production  marketing  selling  administrative  and executive employees 
salaries  wages and benefits decreased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the decrease was a result of reductions in our workforce related to reduced revenue volume  our decision to subcontract a portion of our production work to offshore subcontractors  and our use of domestic subcontractors to manage fluctuating labor needs 
subcontractor costs 
subcontractor costs include production costs incurred through the use of third parties for production tasks such as data conversion services to meet contract requirements  and field survey services 
the use of domestic subcontractors enables us to better manage the fluctuations in labor requirements as we complete and begin new projects as well as during the various phases of contracts 
subcontractor costs increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal  and to from  respectively  as a percentage of revenues 
the increase was due to our increased use of domestic subcontractors on certain projects 
a decrease in production salaries  wages and related benefits offset the increase 
other general and administrative 
other general and administrative expenses include rent  maintenance  travel  supplies  utilities  insurance and professional services 
such expenses decreased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the decrease was attributable to decreases in travel and supplies that varied with the general decrease in personnel in fiscal and a reduction in professional fee expenses in fiscal as compared to fiscal additionally  upon settlement with our insurer we released a reserve for legal fees relating to an arbitration hearing that was settled in our favor in december  which resulted in a reduction to general and administrative expenses by approximately  depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization for fiscal decreased to  from  for fiscal due to equipment becoming fully depreciated 
the replacement cost on computer equipment is significantly lower than the replaced items 
additionally  we have been able to upgrade existing equipment  which has minimized our need to purchase new equipment 
accordingly  depreciation expense has decreased in recent periods 
severance and related costs 
we incurred severance expense of  in fiscal and  in fiscal the expense in fiscal was incurred as a result of the termination of an employment contract that provided for a significant severance payment 
severance expense in fiscal was incurred as a result of the termination of several positions  but lower individual severance payments and lower total expense 
other income expense 
other income expense is comprised primarily of interest expense and other income resulting from the change in the fair value of the derivative features of the note 
interest expense increased to  for fiscal from  in fiscal year we incurred interest expense on the second note and the restructured note that is payable only upon its conversion or maturity totaling  and  in fiscal and  respectively 
we also incurred non cash interest expense related to the note and the preferred stock of  and  in fiscal and  respectively 
additionally  we incurred non cash interest expense related to the dividends accrued and accretion of the preferred stock totaling  in fiscal as compared to  in fiscal the increase was a result of our adoption of sfas no 
effective july   which required that the accretion  or the increase in the carrying value  of the preferred stock  be classified as interest expense 
prior to july   the accretion was recorded as a charge to retained earnings 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
other interest expense is related to various other debt instruments 

table of contents other income expense is earned incurred as a result of the decrease or increase in the fair market values of the derivative features  which change proportionately with the change in the market value of our common stock 
we recorded other income totaling  and  in fiscal and  respectively  as a result of the decrease in the fair market value of the derivative features of the restructured note at the end of each period 
gain on extinguishment of debt  net of tax 
we recorded a  gain on the early redemption of  shares of our preferred stock 
we paid the holders of these preferred shares a payment totaling  to redeem the shares 
the carrying value of the shares on the redemption dates was approximately  accrued dividends totaling approximately  were forgiven in the redemption agreement 
the early redemption resulted in a gain totaling  and reduced the mandatory redemption payment due in december  to the holders of the preferred stock from  to income tax benefit 
federal income tax expense for fiscal year is projected to be zero and accordingly  we recorded an effective federal income tax rate of 
federal income tax expense for fiscal year was zero 
as a result of the uncertainty that sufficient future taxable income can be recognized to realize additional deferred tax assets  no income tax benefit has been recognized for fiscal and net loss 
net loss available to common shareholders of million in fiscal is a million decrease from the million net loss in fiscal we reduced our loss from operations in fiscal as compared to by approximately  the remainder of the decrease was a result of the million gain on extinguishment of debt that we recorded in fiscal and the reduced accretion of the preferred stock in as compared to fiscal fiscal years ended september  and revenues 
we recognize revenues as services are performed 
revenues recorded in a period are reported net of adjustments to reflect changes in estimated profitability of each project 
revenues decreased or million to million for fiscal from million for fiscal this decrease was primarily due to a decline in the number and size of customer contracts 
salaries  wages and benefits 
salaries  wages and benefits include employee compensation for production  marketing  selling  administrative  and executive employees 
salaries  wages and benefits decreased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal this decrease was primarily due to across the board staff reductions 
as a percentage of revenues  salaries  wages and benefits decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal subcontractor costs 
subcontractor costs include production costs incurred through the use of third parties for production tasks such as data conversion services to meet contract requirements  aerial photography and ground and airborne survey services 
subcontractor costs decreased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal this decrease was due to a decreased number of contracts  completing backlog that utilized subcontractor labor and the sale of our colorado office 
subcontractor costs increased as a percentage of revenues to for fiscal from for fiscal principally as a result of our use of domestic subcontractors in fiscal as compared to offshore subcontractors in fiscal other general and administrative 
other general and administrative expenses includes rent  maintenance  travel  supplies  utilities  insurance and professional services 
such expenses decreased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the decrease was primarily attributable to decreases in travel  supplies and certain professional services expenses  which varied with the general decrease in personnel in fiscal as a percentage of revenues  other general and administrative expenses increased slightly to for fiscal from for fiscal depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization for fiscal decreased to  from  for fiscal due to equipment becoming fully depreciated and the consolidation from four production centers to two 
as a percentage of revenues  depreciation and amortization was for fiscal and for fiscal severance and related costs 
we incurred severance expense of  in fiscal and  in fiscal these costs represented and of revenues in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the expense in fiscal was incurred as a result of the termination of an employment contract that provided for a significant severance payment 
other income expense 
other income expense is comprised primarily of interest expense and other income resulting from the change in the fair value of the derivative features of the note 
interest expense increased to  for fiscal from  in fiscal year this increase is due to the recognition of accretion and discount on our preferred stock as interest expense during the fourth quarter of as required by fsas no 
 offset by a decrease in interest paid on bank debt as a result of the 
table of contents extinguishment of bank debt in the first six months of fiscal most of the interest expense in fiscal is non cash in nature as it relates to accretion of discount or payment is deferred 
we incurred non cash interest expense related to the note of  and  in fiscal and  respectively 
we also recorded  of non cash interest expense in fiscal as a result of our adoption of sfas no 
effective july   which required that the accretion  or the increase in the carrying value  of the preferred stock to be classified as interest expense 
prior to july   the accretion was recorded as a charge to retained earnings 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we incurred interest expense on the note that is payable only upon its conversion or maturity totaling  and  in fiscal and  respectively 
other interest expense is related to various other debt instruments 
other income expense is earned incurred as a result of the decrease or increase in the fair market values of the derivative features  which change proportionately with the change in the market value of our common stock 
we recorded other income totaling  and  in fiscal and  respectively  as a result of the decrease in the fair market value of the derivative features of the note at the end of each period 
gain on extinguishment of debt  net of tax 
we recognized a gain on the extinguishment of debt of million in fiscal such gain is a result of the debt forgiveness related to a million cash payment  the issuance of a  unsecured promissory note and the issuance of non convertible preferred stock with an original fair value of  to fully retire debt of million 
this gain reflects net tax of due to our estimated effective tax rate for the year 
income tax benefit 
we recorded an income tax benefit of million in fiscal as a result of a recent change in federal tax regulations 
we recorded zero tax expense for fiscal and also  as a result of the uncertainty that sufficient future taxable income can be recognized to realize additional deferred tax assets  no additional income tax benefit has been recognized for fiscal and cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
we elected early adoption of fsas no 
 accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets  as of october  we determined that goodwill had been impaired under the provisions of fsas no 
and we recognized a loss of million as the cumulative effect of this change in accounting principle during fiscal net earnings loss 
net loss available to common shareholders of million in fiscal is an million decrease from the million net earnings in fiscal as discussed above  one time non operational items accounted for the majority of the variance 
liquidity and capital resources table of contractual obligations 
below is a schedule by period due of the future payments in thousands which we are obligated to make over the next five years based on agreements in place as of september  fiscal year ending september total operating leases debt preferred stock redemption total historically  the principal source of our liquidity consisted of cash flow from operations supplemented by secured lines of credit and other borrowings 
at september   our debt obligations included a restructured note as defined below  redeemable preferred stock with a redemption value of  and other miscellaneous borrowings 
a mandatory redemption payment of  is due on december  we do not have a line of credit and we are generally restricted from additional borrowings or issuing additional equity securities without the consent of tonga  the holder of the restructured note 
tonga also has a right of first refusal as to certain subsequent financings 
in november  tonga converted the restructured note and liquidated its holdings of our common stock 
the conversion eliminated our obligations under the restructured note as disclosed below and our restrictions from seeking additional securities or issuing additional equity securities 
however  there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional borrowings should we seek to do so 

table of contents our debt is summarized as follows in thousands 
september  september  long term debt senior secured convertible note related party other redeemable preferred stock less current portion on april   we completed the sale of the old note and warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock to tonga 
the old note  which carried a face value of million  matured on april   and accrued interest on its face value at an annual rate of 
accrued interest was to be converted into common stock upon the old note s voluntary conversion date or maturity 
we recorded the old note at million reflecting a discount after giving effect to the  and  estimated fair value of the warrant and the conversion feature  respectively  derivative features which were recorded as current liabilities 
on october   we received a notice of conversion from tonga for  in principal of the old note 
on november   we issued  shares at a conversion price equal to  which represented of the average closing bid prices for the three trading days having the lowest closing bid price during the trading days immediately prior to october  we also issued  shares at the same conversion price for  of accrued interest on the converted principal 
the old note was exchanged for the shares and the million second note bearing the same terms 
the newly issued shares increased our total common shares outstanding from  to  tonga owned of our outstanding shares immediately after the partial conversion 
on may   an event of default was triggered under the second note when our registration statement on form s filed with the sec on december  to register shares of our common stock that were issued or are issuable pursuant to the old note  the second note  and the warrant was not declared effective by the sec 
on june   the event of default was cured when we restructured the second note 
the million restructured note bears interest at a rate of per annum with such interest accruing beginning on november  the principal amount of the restructured note  together with accrued and unpaid interest  is due and payable at tonga s option in cash or shares of our common stock on january  tonga retained the right to convert the restructured note for shares of our common stock at any time 
tonga waived accrued interest on the second note through november   which totaled  tonga also waived its rights to assess liquidated damages pursuant to the second note  relinquished its rights under the warrant and canceled the warrant 
the carrying value of the second note immediately prior to the execution of the restructured note was million  which reflected the million face value less the  unamortized discount 
additionally  immediately prior to the execution of the restructured note  the fair value of the warrant totaled approximately  and the fair value of the conversion feature of the second note totaled approximately  as a result of the extended term of the restructured note  the estimated fair value of the conversion feature increased to approximately  we recorded the restructured note at million reflecting a discount for the  estimated fair value of the conversion feature  which was recorded as a current liability 
this transaction resulted in a net decrease in total liabilities of approximately  the decrease consisted of  of waived interest  the  fair value of the canceled warrant  and a  decrease in the carrying value of the restructured note  offset by a  increase in the fair value of the conversion feature 
we recorded the  decrease in liabilities as a capital contribution pursuant to staff accounting bulletin topic b 
prior to the issuance of the restructured note  the carrying value of the second note was accreted to its face value as we recorded interest expense over its three year term at a rate of  per quarter 
the effective rate of interest on the second note was 
the  current liability was increased or decreased to reflect the fair value of the derivatives at the end of each quarter 
the million carrying value of the restructured note will be accreted to its face value as we record interest expense over the remaining eighteen month term at a rate of approximately  per quarter 
the effective interest of the restructured note is 
additionally  the  current liability will be increased or decreased to reflect the fair value of the conversion feature at the end of each quarter until the restructured note is paid in full or is converted into common stock 
the fair value of the derivative features of the second note decreased from  on september   to  on june   prior to issuance of the restructured note 
the fair value of the derivative feature of the restructured note increased  
table of contents from approximately  on june  to  on september  accordingly  we recorded other income totaling approximately  in fiscal the fair value of the derivative features decreased from  on september   to  on september  accordingly  we recorded other income totaling  in fiscal on november   we received a notice of conversion dated november   from tonga to convert the outstanding principal and accrued interest into our common stock at the conversion price set forth in the restructured note 
the conversion price was  and was equal to of the average closing bid prices for the three trading days having the lowest closing bid price during the trading days immediately prior to november  the newly issued shares increased our total common shares outstanding from  to  tonga owned of our outstanding shares immediately after the conversion 
according to filings made by tonga under section of the exchange act  tonga liquidated its holdings of our common stock by november  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the restructured note was secured by all of our assets 
as part of the transaction  for a period of three years from the date of the old note  tonga received the right to appoint a majority of our board of directors 
tonga has appointed three members to the board and as a result  controls asi 
however  upon the conversion of the restructured note  which released all of our assets  and upon the subsequent sale of tonga s holdings of our common stock  tonga relinquished its right to appoint directors  which may result in the appointment by us of new independent directors and relinquishment of tonga s control 
at september    shares of preferred stock are outstanding and which are redeemable on or before december  until december   we are entitled to redeem these shares at per share  or  the redemption price increases per year to on december   on december   and on december  
on december   we must redeem  of the outstanding preferred stock 
since its issuance  we have accrued but not declared or paid dividends on the preferred stock 
if we pay the  mandatory redemption payment on or before december   the redemption price will be  and we will redeem  shares of the preferred stock 
if we redeem the remaining outstanding shares on december   we will redeem  shares at per share  totaling  the preferred stock earns a dividend at the annual rate of of the then applicable redemption price on a cumulative  non participating basis and has a liquidation preference equal to the then applicable redemption value of shares outstanding at the time of liquidation 
since its issuance  we have accrued but not declared or paid dividends on the preferred stock 
accrued dividends at september   totaled approximately  the accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis  which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business 
since fiscal  we have experienced significant operating losses with corresponding reductions in working capital 
our revenues and backlog decreased significantly during that time 
these factors  among others  have resulted in our independent auditors issuing an audit opinion on the september   financial statements that expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
to address the going concern issue  management implemented financial and operational restructuring plans designed to improve operating efficiencies  reduce and eliminate cash losses  and position us for profitable operations 
financial steps included restructuring our bank debt through the issuance of preferred stock and convertible debt  subsequent collection of the federal income tax refund and sale of non core assets 
operational steps included the consolidation of production services to two solution centers  reduction of corporate and non core spending activities  outsourcing certain components of projects  and deploying a new sales and marketing team 
in fiscal  we retired of our preferred stock for of its redemption value and accrued dividends 
we also restructured our convertible debt by issuing the restructured note to cure an event of default and reduced the total interest payable thereon 
tonga s conversion of the restructured note in november eliminated liabilities totaling approximately  we will further reduce our occupancy expenses in fiscal when the lease on our corporate headquarters expires and we are able to relocate to more efficient and appropriate facilities 
the financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability of assets and the classifications of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern 
however  we believe that our turnaround efforts  if successful  will improve operations and generate sufficient cash to meet our obligations in a timely manner 
in the absence of a line of credit and because of our inability to secure debt on terms that would be considered reasonable based on our recent operating history  we depend on internal cash flow to sustain operations 
internal cash flow is significantly affected by customer contract terms and progress achieved on projects 
fluctuations in internal cash flow are reflected in three contract related accounts accounts receivable  revenues in excess of billings  and billings in excess of revenues 
under the percentage of completion method of accounting accounts receivable is created when an amount becomes due from a customer  which typically occurs when an event specified in the contract triggers a billing 

table of contents revenues in excess of billings occur when we have performed under a contract even though a billing event has not been triggered 
billings in excess of revenues occur when we receive an advance or deposit against work yet to be performed 
these accounts  which represent a significant investment by us in our business  affect our cash flow as projects are signed  performed  billed and collected 
at september   we had multiple contracts with four customers  the aggregate of which accounted for of our consolidated revenues in fiscal revenues from these four customers accounted for of our consolidated revenues in fiscal two customers accounted for of total accounts receivable and revenue in excess of billings at september  worldwide services and keyspan 
worldwide services also represented of the total balance of net accounts receivable and revenue in excess of billings at september  billing terms are negotiated in a competitive environment and  as stated above  are based on reaching project milestones 
we anticipate that sufficient billing milestones will be achieved during fiscal such that revenue in excess of billings for these customer contracts will begin to decline 
in order to meet our short term cash requirements we must collect more cash from our customers than we pay to our employees and suppliers 
to meet our long term cash requirements  we must complete certain projects in fiscal and that are related to the balance of revenues in excess of billings at september   in order to generate sufficient cash flow to fund operations and expenditures and to meet our debt requirements 
we anticipate that the successful completion of these projects will reduce the balance of unearned revenue and generate cash sufficient to meet both our short term and long term debt obligations 
we expect that we will be able to complete a majority of these contracts by june   but there can be no assurance that market conditions or other factors may prevent us from doing so or that the cash generated will be equal to the amount that we currently anticipate 
if we are unable to complete the contracts and generate cash by earning and collecting our unearned revenues  we will be forced to obtain additional financing and or restrict capital and operating expenditures to match available resources 
if these actions are not sufficient  and we are not able to meet our commitments when due  then we will be forced to liquidate assets and repay our secured creditors with the proceeds 
our operating activities used  and  cash in fiscal and  respectively  and provided positive cash flow of million in fiscal contract related accounts described in the previous paragraph declined million  million  and million in fiscal   and  respectively 
accounts payable and accrued expenses decreased million in fiscal  increased million in fiscal and decreased million in fiscal prepaid expenses remained relatively constant in fiscal and and decreased by million in fiscal cash provided by investing activities principally consisted of proceeds from sales of assets  offset by the purchases of equipment and leasehold improvements 
we purchased equipment and leasehold improvements totaling   and  in   and  respectively

table of contents impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of sfas 
sfas no 
provides additional transition guidance for those entities that elect to voluntarily adopt the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
furthermore  sfas no 
mandates new disclosures in both interim and year end financial statements of the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we adopted sfas no 
on april  we do not expect to change to using the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation  and therefore  adoption of sfas no 
is expected to impact only the disclosures  not our financial results 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity  which establishes standards for how an issuer of financial instruments classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability or an asset in some circumstances if  at inception  the monetary value of the obligation is based solely or predominantly on a fixed monetary amount known at inception  variations in something other than the fair value of the issuer s equity shares or variations inversely related to changes in the fair value of the issuer s equity shares 
sfas no 
is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  effective july   we adopted sfas no 
 which resulted in the reclassification of million of redeemable preferred stock issued prior to may   to debt 
future preferred stock dividends will be classified as interest expense 
there may be potential new accounting pronouncements or regulatory rulings which may have an impact on our future financial position and results of operations  in particular  an accounting pronouncement or other regulatory ruling related to the accounting for employee stock options and employee stock purchase plans as an expense

and proposed fas r  which currently is expected to be effective for public companies in periods beginning after june  we would be required to implement the proposed standard no later than the quarter that begins july  the cumulative effect of adoption  if any  applied on a modified prospective basis  would be measured and recognized on july  fas r would eliminate the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using accounting principles board opinion no 
or apb  accounting for stock issued to employees  and would instead require companies to recognize compensation expense using a fair value based method  for costs related to share based payments including stock options and employee stock purchase plans 
the fasb expects to issue a final standard by december  the adoption of fas r could materially impact our results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we may from time to time employ risk management techniques such as interest rate swaps and foreign currency hedging transactions 
none of these techniques is used for speculative or trading purposes and the amounts involved are not considered material 
short term interest rate changes would have little impact on interest expense due to our lack of any material variable interest rate debt
