item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations factors that may affect our results 
we do not intend to update any of these factors or to publicly announce the results of any revisions to these forward looking statements  other than what is required under the federal securities laws 
part i item business overview we are a pharmaceutical company developing therapeutic advancements in a cost effective manner 
our product development efforts are focused on diseases with unmet medical needs where we can improve efficacy  safety and or patient convenience 
since our inception  we have developed the largest and most advanced product pipeline in the field of migraine 
we are also exploring the development of product candidates in other pain related therapeutic areas 
we currently have three product candidates in the migraine area 
mt  a combination of metoclopramide hydrochloride and naproxen sodium  is being developed as an oral  first line treatment for migraine pain and associated symptoms 
we have completed all planned phase pivotal clinical trials for mt  which consistently demonstrated mt s effectiveness in treating migraine pain 
in july  we submitted a new drug application nda to the us food and drug administration fda for mt the nda was accepted for filing by the fda in october on january   we submitted to the fda the report of the results of a two year rat carcinogenicity study  thereby completing our nda submission 
we believe the results provided no evidence that the concomitant administration of maximum tolerated doses of metoclopramide and naproxen  the two active components in mt  produced any statistically significant differences in findings from those seen with metoclopramide alone 
none of the tumors observed in the study were considered to be directly related to the administration of metoclopramide or naproxen  all were considered to be secondary to metoclopramide induced increases in the levels of the hormone prolactin in the affected rats 
we expect the fda to complete its review of the nda by may  our mt technology  which we refer to as mt  is being developed as a co active acute migraine therapy  combining the activity of a triptan with that of a long lasting non steroidal anti inflammatory drug nsaid 
in june  we signed an agreement with glaxosmithkline gsk for the development and commercialization of proprietary combinations of a triptan ht 
b d 
agonist and a long acting nsaid 
the combinations covered by the agreement are among the combinations of mt we plan to commence phase clinical trials in mt  a proprietary formulation of injectable dihydroergotamine mesylate dhe in a pre filled syringe  is being developed to provide long lasting pain relief for patients needing a convenient injectable therapy for severe migraine attacks 
in september  we signed an agreement with xcel pharmaceuticals  inc xcel for the further development and commercialization of mt in october  we received a not approvable letter from the fda related to our mt nda  which was submitted in december  based on the fda s conclusion that mt failed to achieve statistical significance versus placebo for the relief at two hours of the ancillary symptoms of migraine nausea  sensitivity to light  and sensitivity to sound 
no clinical safety issues were identified in the letter  nor were any non clinical issues cited as impacting the fda s decision to issue the not approvable letter 
we are working with the fda to seek to resolve the issues raised in the letter as soon as possible 

table of contents we plan to enter into collaborations with established pharmaceutical or pharmaceutical services companies to commercialize and manufacture our product candidates 
to date  we have entered into collaborations with gsk  xcel and nycomed danmark aps nycomed for the development and commercialization of our current migraine product candidates 
we may also elect in certain circumstances to develop sales and distribution capabilities internally to commercialize one or more of our product candidates 
business strategy our goal is to become a leading pharmaceutical development company 
the principal elements of our business strategy are to efficiently develop and commercialize our portfolio of product candidates 
we expect to focus a substantial portion of our efforts over the next few years on the further development  approval and commercialization of our existing portfolio of product candidates 
a key element of our strategy is to establish collaborations with leading corporations to commercialize our product candidates  and we have entered into and expect to continue to enter into such commercialization collaborations 
where appropriate  we may also elect to develop sales and distribution capabilities internally in order to commercialize one or more of our product candidates 
in certain instances  we may also promote our products in collaboration with other pharmaceutical companies 
build a product pipeline through innovation  in licensing and acquisition 
we intend to build our product pipeline through innovation  in licensing and or acquisition of select proprietary product candidates 
we will focus primarily on therapeutic areas with significant commercial potential in which members of our management team have development expertise 
these areas of expertise include gastrointestinal disease  respiratory disease  infectious disease and pain 
we plan to develop a pipeline of novel products that exhibit distinct advantages over currently marketed products  as well as innovative combinations of products in convenient  therapeutically appropriate formulations 
leverage development efforts through strategic outsourcing 
while maintaining overall control of the planning  development and regulatory processes  we seek to enter into strategic outsourcing relationships to develop and commercialize our product candidates in a cost effective manner 
we have contracted and plan to contract with third parties for product candidate testing  development and manufacturing 
migraine products under development migraine market overview migraine is characterized by recurring attacks of headache  often associated with visual  auditory or gastrointestinal disturbances 
while the precise mechanism of migraine is unknown  researchers believe migraine attacks are caused by acute inflammation surrounding selected blood vessels in the head 
the average migraine sufferer experiences the first attack during the early teen years  and the attacks generally continue throughout adulthood 
it is estimated that global sales of prescription pharmaceuticals for the treatment of migraine will approach billion by not all migraine attacks are of the same severity 
consequently  various types of oral  intranasal and injectable therapies are used to treat different types of migraine attacks 
many patients use a personal  individually developed  step care approach to treat their attacks 
attacks are often treated initially with simple over the counter analgesics  particularly if the patient is unable to determine if the attack is a migraine or some other type of headache 
if over the counter remedies are unsuccessful  patients often turn to more potent prescription drugs  including narcotics  analgesic narcotic drug combinations and triptans 

table of contents triptans are the family of drugs most commonly prescribed for the treatment of migraine attacks 
triptans have demonstrated the ability to treat migraines by constricting blood vessels in the brain 
although triptans can be effective in treating migraine symptoms  they are often associated with significant side effects and other disadvantages that include the occurrence of cardiovascular related events  including chest pain discomfort  throat discomfort and warm cold sensations  the potential for serious cardiovascular events  including death  difficulty in producing sustained benefits with a single dose in a majority of patients  the occurrence of nausea and dizziness during treatment  and the need for cardiovascular evaluations from physicians before initially prescribing triptans to patients with cardiovascular disease risk factors 
despite these shortcomings  in  according to ims health s retail and provider perspective  or ims  total triptan sales in the us were approximately billion 
imitrex  marketed by gsk  is the leading triptan product  with  according to ims  total us sales of approximately billion in there are currently three triptan formulations commercially available oral  intranasal and injectable 
oral triptans are often prescribed as a first line treatment for migraine pain 
intranasal triptans are often prescribed for patients requiring faster relief than oral drugs can provide or who cannot take oral medications 
for the most severe attacks  patients sometimes use an injectable form of a triptan 
because of the problems associated with triptans  and various problems associated with narcotics and analgesics  we believe that an opportunity exists in all migraine therapeutic segments for products designed to deliver an improved onset and duration of relief with reduced side effects  especially those related to cardiovascular events 
mt mt is being developed as an oral first line therapy for the treatment of migraine pain and associated symptoms 
oral products are currently the most prevalent form of migraine therapy 
according to ims  existing oral prescription products accounted for approximately billion in sales in the us in  of which the imitrex oral dosage form accounted for approximately million 
mt is a proprietary formulation that combines metoclopramide hydrochloride  a commercially available agent that relieves nausea  enhances stomach emptying  and possesses some analgesic activity  and naproxen sodium  a commercially available anti inflammatory and analgesic agent 
mt is designed to release metoclopramide hydrochloride initially  followed by naproxen sodium 
the metoclopramide is intended to accelerate the absorption of naproxen and to reduce nausea  which can be associated with migraine  its analgesic activity supplements that provided by naproxen 
results from our pharmacokinetic study in normal volunteers  completed in  indicated that peak naproxen blood levels were approximately higher and were achieved approximately minutes faster following administration of mt than with naproxen sodium alone 
clinical development in july  we submitted to the fda an nda for mt the nda was accepted for filing by the fda in october on january   we submitted to the fda the report of the results of a two year rat carcinogenicity study  thereby completing our nda submission 
we believe the results provided no evidence that the concomitant administration of maximum tolerated doses of metoclopramide and naproxen  the two active components in mt  produced any statistically significant differences in findings from those seen with metoclopramide alone 
none of the tumors observed in the study were considered to be directly related to the administration of metoclopramide or naproxen  all were considered to be secondary to metoclopramide induced increases in the levels of the hormone prolactin in the affected rats 
we expect the fda to complete its review of the nda by may  in october  we submitted a marketing authorization application maa for mt to the medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency mhra in the united kingdom uk 
if approved in the uk  we will seek approval in selected european countries through the european union mutual recognition procedure 
this procedure allows other european countries to grant national approvals based upon the review and endorsement of the mhra in the uk 
in september  we received a letter of comments relating to the maa from an advisory group to the mhra 
we intend to submit a response to the comments raised by the advisory group during the first quarter of we will need to satisfactorily address the issues raised by the advisory group  including providing additional support for the benefits for the combination  in order to obtain approval in the uk 

table of contents in order to obtain regulatory approval for mt  we are required to demonstrate its efficacy and safety 
to demonstrate the efficacy of a combination product candidate such as mt  which combines two previously approved component products  we must demonstrate in clinical trials that it is both superior to each of its individual components  and more effective in treating all symptoms of migraine when compared to a placebo 
for mt  this means that we must show that statistically more patients have achieved sustained pain relief  defined as migraine pain relief at two hours that is maintained throughout the next hours without the use of rescue medication  than patients treated with the component products 
we must also show that mt is superior to placebo for relief of nausea  sensitivity to light and sensitivity to sound 
generally  the fda requires two successful clinical trials to demonstrate that the product candidate meets each of these standards for approval 
to this end  and to demonstrate mt s effectiveness as compared to other migraine therapies  we have completed a total of two phase clinical trials  six phase clinical trials  and three marketing support phase b studies  involving in total more than  treated patients  more than  of whom have received some form of mt the phase and phase b clinical trials consistently demonstrated mt s effectiveness in treating migraine pain 
significantly  in two phase trials in which mt was compared to imitrex and placebo  mt demonstrated comparable efficacy to imitrex  and a lower percentage of patients taking a single tablet dose of mt reported adverse events than patients taking imitrex 
adverse events from a long term safety study included drowsiness  diarrhea  abdominal pain  dizziness  infection and nervousness 
in addition  data from one phase study was presented at the september xi congress of the international headache society showing that a two tablet dose of mt appears to be more effective in providing pain relief at two hours than a single tablet dose of imitrex mg in migraine patients with nausea or severe pain at baseline 
our mt phase and b trials are described below two phase pivotal clinical trials  a  patient trial completed in and a  patient trial completed in  compared mt to its components 
in both trials  the sustained pain response for patients receiving mt was statistically significantly greater than the rate for patients receiving either naproxen sodium or metoclopramide hydrochloride alone 
using the statistical analysis methodology  logistic regression  specified in the first trial s protocol  mt showed statistically significant superiority over only one of its two components 
however  mt showed statistically significant superiority over both components when the results of this trial were analyzed using ordered logistic regression  a refinement of the statistical analysis methodology originally specified in the protocol 
the results from the second trial  which was designed based on discussions with the fda  were analyzed using ordered logistic regression and confirmed the results of the first trial 
we therefore believe that we have satisfied the fda requirement for the successful completion of two phase clinical trials showing mt to be superior to its components 
two phase clinical trials comparing a single tablet dose of mt with a mg dose of imitrex  the most widely prescribed dose of this triptan  were completed in and in both trials  the sustained pain relief rates were nearly identical for mt and imitrex and both were statistically superior to placebo 
the more recent trial  a  patient trial completed in  showed that both mt and imitrex were statistically superior to placebo for the relief of nausea  sensitivity to light and sensitivity to sound within hours of dosing 
in the initial comparison  a patient trial completed in  mt was also found to be superior to placebo in the relief of nausea  sensitivity to light and sensitivity to sound 
the incidence of adverse events was lower for patients taking a single tablet dose of mt than patients taking imitrex 
these results further confirmed the effectiveness of mt in treating migraine pain 
a phase multiple dosing trial including patients was completed in mid the trial demonstrated that mt provided statistically significant superiority over placebo for sustained pain relief and  within two hours after initial dosing  for relief of nausea  sensitivity to light and sensitivity to sound 
a phase long term safety trial including more than  patients was completed in february this trial showed mt to be well tolerated 
only of the patients discontinued the study because of an adverse event  including fatigue  drowsiness  restlessness  anxiety and diarrhea 
no patients discontinued the study because of chest pain or discomfort 
a phase b clinical trial including patients was completed in comparing mt to placebo in patients with an intolerance to a triptan or with cardiovascular risk factors that would warrant 
table of contents cautious use of a triptan 
this trial demonstrated that mt provided statistically significant superiority to placebo for sustained pain relief 
a phase b clinical trial including patients was completed in comparing a two tablet dose of mt to placebo in patients who had not responded adequately to oral imitrex 
in this trial  mt demonstrated statistically significant superiority to placebo for sustained pain relief 
a phase b clinical trial including patients was completed in  comparing a single tablet dose of mt given within one hour of migraine pain to placebo 
the data demonstrated that mt provided sustained pain relief in statistically significantly more patients with moderate and severe baseline pain than placebo 
in those patients who took mt when their pain was of moderate intensity  the difference between mt treated and placebo treated patients who achieved sustained pain relief was even greater 
additionally  mt provided statistically superior two hour pain relief in patients with moderate and severe pain compared to placebo 
mt also provided statistically significant relief of the associated symptoms of migraine including sustained relief from nausea  sensitivity to light and sensitivity to sound 
in addition to the required clinical trials  we completed a six month oral dosing carcinogenicity study in p transgenic mice in the results from the six month study indicated that mt was not carcinogenic in p transgenic mice 
as discussed earlier  we recently completed a two year rat carcinogenicity study 
we believe the results provided no evidence that the concomitant administration of maximum tolerated doses of metoclopramide and naproxen  the two active components in mt  produced any statistically significant differences in findings from those seen with metoclopramide alone 
none of the tumors observed in the study were considered to be directly related to the administration of metoclopramide or naproxen  all were considered to be secondary to metoclopramide induced increases in the levels of the hormone prolactin in the affected rats 
mt mt is being developed as a co active migraine therapy  combining the activity of a triptan drug with that of an nsaid 
we believe that the effective treatment of migraine requires targeted  specific and complementary co active therapy to achieve maximum therapeutic benefit with the fewest side effects 
in june  we signed an agreement with gsk for the development and commercialization of proprietary combinations of a triptan ht 
b d 
agonist and a long acting nsaid 
the combinations covered by the agreement are among the combinations of mt clinical development in  the fda approved our request to submit the mt nda as a b application  under which the fda allows a reduced development program 
in the uk  the mhra agreed to a similar development program 
this reduced development plan will allow mt to proceed to phase clinical trials 
we plan to commence phase clinical trials in in  we completed a patient  phase double blind  placebo controlled  single dose clinical trial in which mt showed statistically significant superiority over placebo and its components on the identified primary outcome measure of sustained pain relief 
in addition  mt showed statistically significant superiority over placebo and its components  including an oral triptan  in the two hour pain response and effectiveness in the relief of migraine associated symptoms 
with respect to the primary endpoint  sustained pain relief  the therapeutic gain with mt was more than twice the therapeutic gain seen with the triptan 
therapeutic gain is equal to the percent of patients with response on active agent minus the percent of patients with response on placebo control agent 
mt mt  a proprietary formulation of injectable dhe in a pre filled syringe  is being developed to provide long lasting pain relief for patients needing a convenient injectable therapy for severe migraine attacks  with a reduced side effect profile compared to existing injectable products 
currently  patients unable to take oral medications due to severe nausea may choose to use an injectable form of a triptan or another drug such as dhe 
however  many patients are unable to tolerate the injections  especially those sensitive to the vascular side effects associated with 
table of contents injectable imitrex 
nevertheless  according to ims  injectable migraine therapeutics represented approximately million in us sales 
published clinical trial results indicate that injectable dhe provides comparable efficacy to injectable imitrex three hours after administration 
in addition  in published clinical trials  only of injectable dhe patients experienced headache recurrence within hours as compared to of injectable imitrex patients 
acute vascular side effects were reported by only of the patients receiving injectable dhe compared to of the patients receiving injectable imitrex 
clinical development in december  we submitted an nda for mt to the fda 
the nda was accepted for filing by the fda in february in october  we received a not approvable letter from the fda related to our mt nda 
the letter was issued based on the fda s conclusion that mt failed to achieve statistical significance versus placebo for the relief of all of the ancillary symptoms of migraine at two hours nausea  sensitivity to light and sensitivity to sound 
the fda expressed concern that the incidence of nausea was statistically higher with mt versus placebo at two hours 
the fda had previously agreed that relief of ancillary symptoms at two hours post dose could constitute secondary endpoints in the two mt phase trials and had agreed to consider relying on the sustained relief analyses for the ancillary symptoms 
in its not approvable letter  the fda concluded that relief of these ancillary symptoms  especially nausea  should be obtained at two hours post dose 
the fda did acknowledge  however  that mt provided a statistically significant improvement over placebo on the pre defined endpoint of sustained pain relief at hours post dose as well as relief of pain at two hours post dose 
we are working with the fda to seek to resolve the issues raised in the not approvable letter as soon as possible 
the results of our two phase trials for mt are as follows a phase clinical trial including patients was completed in this trial demonstrated that mt provided sustained pain relief and pain relief at two hours in statistically significantly more patients than placebo 
mt provided statistically significant relief of sensitivity to light by two hours following dosage  but did not provide relief of sensitivity to sound or nausea over the two hour post dose period 
however  with respect to patients who were free of nausea  sensitivity to light and sensitivity to sound at two hours  a statistically significantly greater number of such patients who were treated with mt than with placebo had no recurrence at hours 
a phase clinical trial including patients was completed in this trial showed that a statistically significantly greater percentage of mt treated patients had sustained pain relief and pain relief at two hours post dosing than patients treated with placebo 
there were no statistically significant differences between mt and placebo in relief of the ancillary symptoms of migraine nausea  sensitivity to light and sensitivity to sound over the two hour post dose period  as specified in the study protocol 
further analysis of the data indicated that a statistically significantly greater number of patients treated with mt than placebo had sustained relief of sensitivity to light and sensitivity to sound and the difference between mt and placebo in the sustained relief of nausea was marginally significant 
other product development efforts in july  we signed an exclusive option agreement with nycomed  under which we may acquire a license to certain rights related to lornoxicam  an nsaid 
we intend to explore the development of novel product candidates containing lornoxicam alone or in combination with other active ingredients for pain or other indications 
additionally  we have begun other exploratory programs 
collaborative arrangements we have entered into and plan to continue to enter into collaborations with established pharmaceutical or pharmaceutical services companies to commercialize and manufacture our product candidates 
our existing commercialization collaborations are described below 

table of contents nycomed danmark aps in june  we signed a licensing agreement with nycomed for the commercialization of mt in four nordic countries 
under the terms of the agreement  nycomed will have exclusive rights in denmark  sweden  norway and finland to commercialize mt upon its approval in these countries 
upon execution of the agreement  nycomed paid us an upfront fee of  potential milestone payments totaling million will be paid upon the occurrence of certain regulatory approvals 
in addition  nycomed will pay us a royalty on sales of mt assuming satisfactory resolution of the issues raised in the september maa comment letter discussed above  we intend to seek approval of mt in denmark  sweden  norway and finland through the european union mutual recognition procedure 
glaxosmithkline in june  we signed an agreement with gsk for the development and commercialization of proprietary combinations of a triptan ht 
b d 
agonist and a long acting nsaid 
the combinations covered by the agreement are among the combinations of mt under the terms of the agreement  gsk will have exclusive rights in the united states to commercialize all combinations which combine gsk s triptans  including imitrex sumatriptan succinate or amerge naratriptan hydrochloride  with a long acting nsaid 
we will be responsible for development of the combination product  while gsk will provide formulation development and manufacturing 
pursuant to the terms of the agreement  we received million in initial payments from gsk following termination of the waiting period under the hart scott rodino notification program and the issuance of a specified patent 
additionally  gsk will potentially pay us milestone payments over the next several years in an amount up to million relating to development progress and regulatory submissions and approvals 
gsk will also pay us royalties on sales of marketed products  and in addition  potential sales performance milestones of up to million if certain sales thresholds are achieved 
xcel pharmaceuticals  inc in september  we signed an agreement with xcel for the further development and commercialization of mt under the terms of the agreement  xcel will have exclusive rights in the united states to commercialize mt pursuant to the terms of the agreement  xcel paid us an upfront fee of million 
under certain circumstances  if we elect not to seek approval of the nda for mt  we would be required to pay to xcel a termination fee of million 
potential milestone payments of up to million will be due upon certain future regulatory approvals and the achievement of a predetermined sales threshold on mt xcel will also pay us royalties on combined sales of mt and xcel s dhe dihydroergotamine mesylate injection  once mt is commercialized 
manufacturing we currently have no manufacturing capability and we do not intend to establish internal manufacturing capabilities 
to date  we have entered into arrangements with third party manufacturers for the supply of formulated and packaged mt  mt and mt clinical trial materials 
use of third party manufacturing enables us to focus on our clinical development strengths  minimize fixed costs and capital expenditures and gain access to advanced manufacturing process capabilities and expertise 
we also intend to enter into agreements with third party manufacturers for the commercial scale manufacturing of our products 
in january  we entered into a commercial supply agreement with dsm pharmaceuticals  inc formerly catalytica pharmaceuticals  inc 
under which dsm will supply us with all mt for commercial sale 
we  or our commercial partners  are required to purchase all commercial supply of mt from dsm for the initial term of the agreement and any extension thereof  unless dsm is unable to meet our  or our commercial partners  requirements 
we have the right to terminate the agreement under certain circumstances after the third anniversary of the first commercial sale of mt following nda approval 
in october  we entered into a commercial supply agreement with lek pharmaceuticals inc  a subsidiary of novartis pharma ag  under which lek agreed to provide us with dhe  which we will formulate as mt we agreed to purchase dhe exclusively from lek  which exclusivity is dependent upon lek s ability to meet our supply requirements and certain other conditions 
lek will supply to us solely and exclusively  under certain circumstances 
we will pay lek  under certain circumstances  a fee in addition to the agreed supply price for dhe  based on a percentage of mt sales revenue 
either party may cancel the agreement under certain conditions 
in addition  lek may terminate the agreement after a certain period of time  under agreed transition  supply and know how transfer provisions  if lek decides to permanently cease the manufacture of dhe 

table of contents we have agreements with various vendors to supply us with clinical supply materials for our mt  mt  and mt clinical trials 
pursuant to our development and commercialization agreement with gsk for mt  gsk will supply us with the required clinical trial materials to conduct our mt clinical trials 
we believe our current supplier agreements should be sufficient to complete both our ongoing and planned clinical trials 
competition not all migraine attacks are of the same severity 
consequently  a variety of oral  injectable and intranasal therapies are used to treat different types of migraine attacks 
attacks are often treated initially with simple over the counter analgesics  particularly if the patient is unable to determine if the attack is a migraine or some other type of headache 
these analgesics include excedrin migraine  which is approved for the pain associated with migraine 
if over the counter remedies are unsuccessful  patients often turn to more potent prescription drugs  including triptans 
according to ims  in  total triptan sales in the us were approximately billion 
imitrex  a triptan product marketed by gsk  had total us sales of approximately billion in  according to ims 
narcotics such as codeine and drugs containing analgesic narcotic combinations  along with other non narcotic pain medications  are also used for the treatment of migraine 
if approved  our migraine product candidates will most likely compete with one or more of the existing migraine therapeutics  as well as any therapies developed in the future 
the pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical industries are intensely competitive and are characterized by rapid technological progress 
certain pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies and academic and research organizations currently engage in  or have engaged in  efforts related to the discovery and development of new medicines for the treatment of migraine symptoms 
significant levels of research in chemistry and biotechnology occur in universities and other nonprofit research institutions 
these entities have become increasingly active in seeking patent protection and licensing revenues for their research results 
they also compete with us in recruiting skilled scientific talent 
our ability to compete successfully will be based on our ability to create and maintain scientifically advanced technology  develop proprietary products  attract and retain scientific personnel  obtain patent or other protection for our products  obtain required regulatory approvals and manufacture and successfully market our products either alone or through outside parties 
some of our competitors have substantially greater financial  research and development  manufacturing  marketing and human resources and greater experience in product discovery  development  clinical trial management  fda regulatory review  manufacturing and marketing than we do 
patents and proprietary information we intend to actively seek  when appropriate  protection for our products and proprietary technology by means of us and foreign patents  trademarks and contractual arrangements 
in addition  we plan to rely upon trade secrets and contractual agreements to protect certain of our proprietary technology and products 
we have six issued us patents and four pending us patent applications  and we presently have pending foreign patent applications or issued foreign patents  relating to mt  mt and mt foreign patent applications have been filed under the patent cooperation treaty  or pct  and are in various stages of prosecution worldwide relating to mt  mt and mt we also have us and pct patent applications pending relating to a novel product concept 
there can be no assurance that our patent applications will issue as patents or  with respect to our issued patents  that they will provide us with significant protection 
the following provides a general description of our patent portfolio and is not intended to represent an assessment of claim limitations or claim scope 
mt we have two issued us patents  one with claims relating to dosage forms that can be used in administering metoclopramide and a long acting nsaid to a patient with migraine headache and one with claims relating to various pharmaceutical compositions and treatment methods that can be used with migraine patients 
within these issued us patents are also claims relating to a method of manufacturing a specific type of dosage form 
we have issued patents in australia and canada 
we have one pending us patent application with claims relating to various pharmaceutical compositions and treatment methods that can be used for migraine patients 
in addition  there are applications relating to mt that are pending in europe and japan 
the expected expiration date of all the issued us and foreign patents relating to mt is november  additional us and foreign patents  if issued  are expected to expire in a similar timeframe 

table of contents mt with respect to mt  we received us and australian patents relating to a high potency formulation of dhe and formulations of dhe in a pre filled syringe 
we also have pending us  european  japanese and australian patent applications with claims relating to high potency formulations and therapeutic packages  and we have patent applications pending in other major markets worldwide 
the expected expiration date of all of the us and foreign patents relating to mt is march  additional us and foreign patents  if issued  would be expected to expire in a similar timeframe 
mt we have three issued us patents with claims relating to methods  compositions and therapeutic packages involving the use of certain nsaids and ht receptor agonists in treating patients with migraine 
outside of the us  we have an issued patent in australia and patent applications relating to mt pending in canada  europe and japan 
the expected expiration date of the issued us patents relating to mt is august  foreign patents  if issued  are expected to expire in a similar timeframe 
we have also filed a us patent application with claims directed to formulations of mt other products we have filed us and foreign patent applications with claims directed to novel formulations for a new product concept which is currently in the exploratory stage 
should any patents issue from these applications they would be expected to expire on may  government regulation the fda and comparable regulatory agencies in foreign countries impose substantial requirements on the clinical development  manufacture and marketing of pharmaceutical product candidates 
these agencies and other federal  state and local entities regulate research and development activities and the testing  manufacture  quality control  safety  effectiveness  labeling  storage  record keeping  approval and promotion of our product candidates 
all of our product candidates will require regulatory approval before commercialization 
in particular  therapeutic product candidates for human use are subject to rigorous preclinical and clinical testing and other requirements of the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act ffdca  implemented by the fda  as well as similar statutory and regulatory requirements of foreign countries 
obtaining these marketing approvals and subsequently complying with ongoing statutory and regulatory requirements is costly and time consuming 
any failure by us or our collaborators  licensors or licensees to obtain  or any delay in obtaining  regulatory approvals or in complying with other requirements could adversely affect the commercialization of product candidates then being developed by us and our ability to receive product or royalty revenues 
the steps required before a new drug product candidate may be distributed commercially in the us generally include conducting appropriate preclinical laboratory evaluations of the product candidate s chemistry  formulation and stability and preclinical studies in animals to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the product candidate  submitting the results of these evaluations and tests to the fda  along with manufacturing information and analytical data  in an investigational new drug application  or ind  initiating clinical trials under the ind after the resolution of any safety or regulatory concerns of the fda  obtaining approval of institutional review boards  or irbs  to introduce the drug into humans in clinical studies  conducting adequate and well controlled human clinical trials that establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for the intended use  typically in the following three sequential  or slightly overlapping stages phase the product is initially introduced into human subjects or patients and tested for safety  dose tolerance  absorption  metabolism  distribution and excretion  phase the product candidate is studied in patients to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks  to determine dosage tolerance and the optimal dosage  and to collect some efficacy data  
table of contents phase the product candidate is studied in an expanded patient population at multiple clinical study sites  to confirm efficacy and safety at the optimized dose  by measuring primary and secondary endpoints established at the outset of the study  submitting the results of preclinical studies  and clinical trials as well as chemistry  manufacturing and control information on the product candidate to the fda in a new drug application form  or nda  and obtaining fda approval of the nda prior to any commercial sale or shipment of the product candidate 
this process can take a number of years and require substantial financial resources 
the results of preclinical studies and initial clinical trials are not necessarily predictive of the results from large scale clinical trials  and clinical trials may be subject to additional costs  delays or modifications due to a number of factors  including the difficulty in obtaining enough patients  clinical investigators  product candidate supply or financial support 
the fda may also require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effect of approved product candidates that have been commercialized  and the agency has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of a product candidate based on the results of these post marketing programs 
upon approval  a product candidate may be marketed only in those dosage forms and for those indications approved in the nda 
we have submitted nda s to the fda for mt and mt see migraine products under development mt clinical development and migraine products under development mt clinical development 
in addition to obtaining fda approval for each indication to be treated with each product candidate  each domestic product candidate manufacturing establishment must register with the fda  list its product with the fda  comply with the applicable fda current good manufacturing practices  or cgmp  regulations  which include requirements relating to quality control and quality assurance  as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation  and permit and pass manufacturing plant inspections by the fda 
moreover  the submission of applications for approval may require additional time to complete manufacturing stability studies 
foreign establishments manufacturing product for distribution in the us also must list their product candidates with the fda and comply with cgmp regulations 
they are also subject to periodic inspection by the fda or by local authorities under agreement with the fda 
any product candidates manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to fda approvals are subject to extensive continuing regulation by the fda  including record keeping requirements and reporting of adverse experiences with the product candidate 
in addition to continued compliance with standard regulatory requirements  the fda may also require post marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety and efficacy of the marketed product 
adverse experiences with the product candidate must be reported to the fda 
product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems concerning safety or efficacy of the product are discovered following approval 
the ffdca also mandates that products be manufactured consistent with cgmp regulations 
in complying with the cgmp regulations  manufacturers must continue to spend time  money and effort in production  record keeping  quality control  and auditing to ensure that the marketed product meets applicable specifications and other requirements 
the fda periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to ensure compliance with cgmp regulations 
failure to comply subjects the manufacturer to possible fda action  such as warning letters  suspension of manufacturing  seizure of the product  voluntary recall of a product or injunctive action  as well as possible civil penalties 
we currently rely on  and intend to continue to rely on  third parties to manufacture our compounds and product candidates 
these third parties will be required to comply with cgmp regulations 
even after the fda approval has been obtained  further studies  including post marketing studies  may be required 
results of post marketing studies may limit or expand the further marketing of the products 
if we propose any modifications to a product  including changes in indication  manufacturing process  manufacturing facility or labeling  a supplement to our nda may be required to be submitted to the fda 
products manufactured in the us for distribution abroad will be subject to fda regulations regarding export  as well as to the requirements of the country to which they are shipped 
these latter requirements are likely to cover the conduct of clinical trials  the submission of marketing applications  and all aspects of manufacturing and marketing 
such requirements can vary significantly from country to country 
we and our contractors are also subject to various federal  state and local laws  rules  regulations and policies relating to safe working conditions  laboratory and manufacturing practices  the experimental use of animals and the 
table of contents use of and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances used in connection with our research work 
although we believe that safety procedures employed for handling and disposing of such materials comply with current federal  state and local laws  rules  regulations and policies  the risk of accidental injury or contamination from these materials cannot be entirely eliminated 
before a medicinal product can be supplied in the european union eu  it must first be granted a marketing authorization 
there are two routes by which this may be achieved the centralized procedure whereby an approval granted by the european commission permits the supply of the product in question throughout the eu or the mutual recognition procedure mrp where a marketing authorization granted by one national authority the reference member state is recognized by the authorities of the other member states concerned member states when conducting their reviews 
this process leads to individual licenses in each member state for the supply of products in that country only 
the centralized route is compulsory for biotechnology products and is optional for certain so called high technology products 
all products which are not authorized by the centralized route must be authorized by the mrp unless the product is designed for use in a single country in which case a national application can be made 
in the uk  the regulation of medicinal products is governed by the medicines act of and subsequent delegated legislation 
essentially all applications  which must include full details of the product and the research that has been carried out to establish its efficacy  safety and quality  must be presented for review by the competent authority  the mhra 
the mhra will assess the data presented to ensure that the product satisfies the appropriate requirements for efficacy  safety and quality 
they may seek additional evaluation by an advisory committee  the committee on safety of medicines csm 
the csm may  if it wishes  advise the mhra to refuse an application 
mt is a fixed combination medicinal product incorporating two previously approved active ingredients 
such products will only be considered acceptable by the mhra if the proposed combination is based on valid therapeutic principles 
the possibility of interactions between the substances will be assessed and it will be necessary to establish that either interactions do not occur or if they do occur  they are clearly established and defined 
furthermore  special safety and efficacy requirements apply to fixed combination products in that the dosage of each active ingredient within the combination product must have a documented contribution within the combination and the combination should demonstrate a level of efficacy above that achieved by a single substance with an acceptable safety profile 
the status of our filing of an maa for mt is discussed in migraine products under development mt clinical development 
if the mhra grants the authorization for the product to be marketed in the uk  further applications will typically be made to the competent authorities of other eu countries by way of the mrp 
the competent authorities of the designated eu countries will be requested to recognize the authorization of the mhra based upon an assessment report prepared by the mhra 
the process should take no longer than days  but if one country makes an objection which under the legislation can only be based on a possible risk to human health  but in practice some countries have used the days to cover issues beyond the scope of the legislation  we have the option to withdraw the application from that country or take the application to arbitration by the committee for propriety medicinal products cpmp of the emea 
if a referral is made  the procedure is suspended and in the intervening time the only eu country in which the product can be marketed will be the uk  even if all other designated countries are ready to recognize the product 
the opinion of the cpmp  which is binding  could support or reflect the objections or alternatively reach a compromise position acceptable to all eu countries concerned 
arbitration can be avoided if the application is withdrawn in the objecting country  but once the application has been referred to arbitration it cannot be withdrawn 
the arbitration procedure may take an additional year before a final decision is reached and may require the delivery of additional data 
once granted  any marketing authorization ma remains subject to pharmacovigilance and all competent authorities have the power to vary  suspend or revoke an ma on grounds of safety 
the extent of us and foreign government regulation which might result from future legislation or administrative action cannot be accurately predicted 
for example  in the us  although the food and drug administration modernization act of modified and created requirements and standards under the ffdca with the intent of facilitating product development and marketing  the fda is still in the process of developing regulations implementing the food and drug administration modernization act of consequently  the actual effect of these and other developments on our own business is uncertain and unpredictable

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a pharmaceutical company developing therapeutic advancements in a cost effective manner 
our product development efforts are focused on diseases with unmet medical needs where we can improve efficacy  safety and or patient convenience 
since our inception  we have developed the largest and most advanced product pipeline in the field of migraine 
we have development and commercial collaboration agreements with gsk  xcel and nycomed 
since inception  our business activities have included product candidate research and development  designing and funding clinical trials for our product candidates  regulatory and clinical affairs  intellectual property prosecution and expansion  and business development  including product acquisition and or licensing and collaboration activities 
we have financed our operations and internal growth primarily through private placements of preferred stock  our initial public offering and  beginning in  collaborations 
beginning in the third quarter of  we began recognizing revenue from initial payments received under our collaboration agreements 
we have incurred significant losses since our inception and have not generated any revenue from product sales 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was million 
our historical operating losses have resulted principally from our research and development activities  including phase clinical trial activities for our product candidates mt and mt  phase clinical trial activities for our product candidate mt  and general and administrative expenses 
we may continue to incur operating losses over the next several years as we complete our development and application for regulatory approval of mt  mt and mt  develop other product candidates  and acquire and develop product portfolios in other therapeutic areas 
our results may vary depending on many factors  including the progress of mt  mt and mt in the clinical and regulatory process  the establishment of collaborations for the development and commercialization of any of our product candidates  and the acquisition and or in licensing  and development  of other therapeutic product candidates 
our ability to generate revenue is dependent upon our ability  alone or with others  to achieve the milestones set forth in our collaboration agreements and successfully develop our migraine and other product candidates  obtain regulatory approvals and successfully manufacture and market our future products 
in october  we received  in net proceeds from the sale of  shares of our common stock in our initial public offering  including the exercise of the underwriters over allotment option 
all of our outstanding preferred shares were converted into shares of our common stock upon the completion of our initial public offering 
critical accounting policies management makes certain judgments and uses certain estimates and assumptions when applying accounting principles generally accepted in the united states in the preparation of our financial statements 
the development and selection of the critical accounting policies  and the related disclosure about these policies  have been reviewed by the audit committee of the board of directors 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an on going basis and base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
our experience and assumptions form the basis for our judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may vary from what we anticipate and different assumptions or estimates about the future could change our reported results 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our financial statements  we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical to us  in that they are important to the portrayal of our financial statements and require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments in the preparation of our financial statements 

table of contents revenue recognition our licensing and other collaborative agreements have terms that include up front payments upon contract signing  additional payments if and when certain milestones in the product s development are reached  and royalty payments based on future product sales 
we recognize revenue under these agreements in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin  revenue recognition as amended by sab revenue recognition  sab  and emerging issues task force eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
under sab recognition of revenue from non refundable up front payments is deferred by the company upon receipt and recognized over the period ending on the anticipated dates of regulatory approvals  as specified in the agreements relating to the product candidates 
we recognize milestone payments as revenue upon the achievement of specified milestones if i the milestone is substantive in nature and the achievement of the milestone was not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement and ii if the fees are non refundable 
any milestone payments received prior to satisfying these revenue recognition criteria will be recorded as deferred revenue 
royalty revenue will be recognized related to the manufacture  sale or use of the company s products or technology 
for those arrangements where royalties are reasonably estimable  the company will recognize revenue based on estimates of royalties earned during the applicable period and adjust for differences between the estimated and actual royalties in the following period 
for those arrangements where royalties are not reasonably estimable  the company will recognize revenue upon receipt of royalty statements from the licensee 
management believes that its current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate the periods for revenue recognition described above are appropriate 
however  we continually review these estimates which could result in a change in the deferral period and might impact the timing and amount of revenue recognition 
further  if regulatory approvals relating to mt  mt or mt are accelerated  delayed or not ultimately obtained  then the amortization of revenues for these products would prospectively be accelerated or reduced accordingly 
as of december   we had deferred million of revenue 
thus far  we have recognized million of revenue relating to our collaboration agreements 
accrued expenses  specifically contracted costs significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the accrued expenses related to contractual costs 
specifically  our management must make estimates of costs incurred to date but not yet invoiced in relation to contracted  external costs 
management analyzes the progress of product development  clinical trial and toxicology and related activities  invoices received and budgeted costs when evaluating the adequacy of the accrued liability for these related costs 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of the accrued liability for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
management believes that current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate accrued expenses for the period are appropriate 
however  determining the date on which certain contract services commence  the level of services performed on or before a given date and the cost of such services often involves subjective judgments 
in the event that we do not identify certain contract costs which have begun to be incurred or we under or over estimate the level of services performed or the costs of such services  our reported accrued expenses for such period would be too low or too high  as the case may be 
income taxes we record deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the net tax effects of tax credits  operating loss carryforwards and temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
we then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
we have not recorded any tax provision or benefit for the years ended december    or since we are unable to conclude whether we will realize any future benefit from deductible temporary differences and net operating loss carry forwards of approximately million for federal and state income tax purposes  which are available to offset future federal and state taxable income  if any  and expire between and  we have provided a valuation allowance for the full amount of our net deferred tax assets 
we also have research and development tax credit carry forwards of approximately million for federal income tax reporting purposes which are available to reduce federal income taxes  if any  and expire between and the tax reform act of  the act  provides for a limitation on the annual use of nol and research and development tax credit carry forwards following certain ownership changes  as defined by the act that could significantly limit our ability 
table of contents to utilize these carry forwards 
we have experienced various ownership changes  as defined by the act  as a result of past financings 
accordingly  our ability to utilize the aforementioned carry forwards may be limited 
if results of operations in the future indicate that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be recovered  the reduction of the valuation allowance will be recorded as a tax benefit during one or more periods 
historical results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue we recognized  of licensing revenue for the year ended december  as compared to no revenue for the year ended december  revenue resulted from initial payments we received pursuant to development and commercialization agreements for mt  mt and mt these agreements have terms that include up front payments upon contract signing and additional payments if and when certain milestones in the product development or related milestones are reached 
all up front payments are being deferred and amortized over the periods ending on the anticipated dates of regulatory approvals  as specified in the agreements relating to the product candidates 
research and development research and development expenses decreased by to  for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  the  decrease was due primarily to a decrease in development costs for mt and mt costs associated with the development of mt decreased by  primarily due to completion of phase clinical trial activities and submission of a nda to the fda in  as compared to costs associated with the development of mt decreased by  primarily due to a reduction in pharmaceutical development activities  including costs incurred in obtaining drug substance  and reduced toxicology activities  as compared to the same period of additional research and development expenses  including lornoxicam product development  other exploratory development  and departmental expenses  increased by  the amortization of deferred stock compensation decreased by  total amortization of deferred stock compensation included in research and development expenses was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we expect that research and development expenses will increase in due to the initiation of phase clinical trial activities for mt and continued development of lornoxicam and other exploratory research programs 
we have included in our research and development expenses the personnel costs related to our research activities and costs related to pharmaceutical development  clinical trial and toxicology activities and regulatory matters 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses increased by to  for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  the  increase was due primarily to increased costs related to administrative  business development and public company activities 
the cost of administrative activities increased by  primarily due to a million compensation payment to our chief executive officer pursuant to a performance based award issued under pozen s long term incentive plan 
business development activities increased by  due to pre marketing activities for mt and mt  and consulting fees associated with the licensing of our products 
public company activities increased by  due to an increase in legal and auditing fees and an increase in director liability insurance and director compensation 
other departmental expense decreased by  primarily due to a  decrease in the amortization of deferred stock compensation 
total amortization of deferred stock compensation included in general and administrative expenses was  and  for and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses consisted primarily of the costs of administrative personnel  facility infrastructure  business development and public company activities 
interest income interest income decreased by to  for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  interest income decreased primarily due to a decline in interest rates during the year 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue we generated no revenue during the years ended december  and research and development research and development expenses increased to  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in expense was due to increased costs associated with the development of mt and mt  offset by a decrease in development costs for mt and termination of all development activities for mt mt costs increased by  primarily due to increased phase clinical trial activities in the second and third quarters of as compared to the same period of and costs associated with submission of an nda to the fda in december mt costs increased by  primarily due to increased costs associated with obtaining drug

interest income  net net interest income decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  interest income declined primarily due to a decline in interest rates along with a decrease in levels of cash and cash equivalents available for investing during the year 
income taxes as of december   we had available net operating loss carry forwards of approximately million for federal and state income tax purposes  which are available to offset future federal and state taxable income  if any  and expire between and we also have research and development tax credit carry forwards of approximately million for federal income tax reporting purposes which are available to reduce federal income taxes  if any  through since our inception  we have incurred substantial losses and expect to incur substantial and recurring losses in future periods 
the tax reform act of the act provides for a limitation on the annual use of net operating loss and research and development tax credit carry forwards following certain ownership changes  as defined by the act that could significantly limit our ability to utilize these carry forwards 
we have experienced various ownership changes  as defined by the act  as a result of past financings 
accordingly  our ability to utilize the aforementioned carry forwards may be limited 
additionally  because us tax laws limit the time during which these carry forwards may be applied against future taxes  we may not be able to take full advantage of these carry forwards for federal income tax purposes 
liquidity and capital resources since our inception  we have financed our operations and internal growth primarily through private placements of preferred stock and our initial public offering  resulting in aggregate net proceeds to us of  additionally in  we received million in cash in upfront fees related to various collaboration agreements 
at december   cash and cash equivalents totaled  an increase of  as compared to december  the increase in cash and cash equivalents resulted primarily from payments received under collaboration agreements offset by expenses associated with our operating activities 
cash provided by operations of  during the year represented a net loss of  offset by non cash charges of  an increase in prepaid and other assets of  and an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of  the increase in accounts payable and other liabilities included  of deferred revenue and an increase in accrued expenses related to our product development activities 
cash used in investing activities of  during the year reflected the purchase of equipment 
cash provided by financing activities during the year totaled  reflecting the net proceeds from the exercise of common stock options 
barring unforeseen developments  we believe that our existing liquidity and capital resources  including the proceeds from our initial public offering and payments received under collaboration agreements  will be sufficient to complete planned product development activities reflected in the description of our business  and to satisfy our other currently anticipated cash needs for operating expenses for the next two years 
we do not expect to make any material capital expenditures during the next two years 
in addition  we do not currently have any milestone or other required material payment obligations during that period 
however  regulatory delays in the development of our existing and future product candidates would increase our cash requirements beyond our current assumed needs and may require that we seek additional funds from sources that may not be available on terms 
table of contents favorable to us 
further  any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties  and actual results could vary as a result of a number of factors 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the number and progress of our clinical trials and other trials and studies  our ability to negotiate favorable terms with various contractors assisting in these trials and studies  our success in and manner of commercializing our products  and costs incurred to enforce and defend our patent claims and other intellectual rights 
we may issue shares of common stock in the future  including to fund additional unplanned development activities 
on february   we filed with the securities and exchange commission a shelf registration statement on form s under which we intend to register  shares of our common stock for sale in one or more public offerings

 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
fin requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
fin is effective immediately for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after january  for variable interest entities created or acquired prior to february   the provisions of fin must be applied for the first interim or annual period ending after march  we did not have any ownership in any variable interest entities as of december  or december  we will apply the consolidation requirement of fin in future periods if we own any interest in any variable interest entity

to have a significant impact on our financial statements 

table of contents factors that may affect our results our business is subject to certain risks and uncertainties  each of which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 
additional risks that are not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business 
we depend heavily on the success of our product candidates  which may never be approved for commercial use 
if we are unable to develop  gain approval of or commercialize those product candidates  we may never be profitable 
we anticipate that for the foreseeable future our ability to achieve profitability will be dependent on the successful development  approval and commercialization of our current product candidates  particularly mt and mt many factors could negatively affect the success of our efforts to develop and commercialize our product candidates  including negative  inconclusive or otherwise unfavorable results from any studies or clinical trials  an inability to obtain  or delay in obtaining  regulatory approval for the commercialization of our product candidates  an inability to establish and or maintain collaborative arrangements with third parties for the manufacture and commercialization of our product candidates  or any disruption of any of these arrangements  a failure to achieve market acceptance of our product candidates  significant delays in any required studies or clinical trials  any demand by the fda or similar governmental agency that we conduct additional clinical trials or other studies and the expenses relating thereto  and significant increases in the costs of any of our studies or clinical trials 
we have incurred losses since inception and we may continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future 
we do not have a current source of product revenue 
we have incurred losses in each year since our inception and our only sources of current revenue are the payments we received pursuant to the agreements entered into with nycomed for mt  gsk for mt and xcel for mt as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we expect to continue to incur significant operating losses and do not know when or if we will generate product revenue 
we expect that the amount of our operating losses will fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter as a result of increases and decreases in development efforts  the timing of payments that we may receive from others  and other factors 
our ability to achieve profitability is dependent on a number of factors  including our ability to develop and obtain regulatory approvals for our product candidates  successfully commercialize our product candidates  which includes maintaining existing  and entering into new  and maintaining new  collaborative agreements  identify and in license new product technologies  achieve milestones and earn royalties under our collaborative agreements  and secure contract manufacturing and distribution services 
if we  or our collaborators  do not obtain and maintain required regulatory approvals  we will be unable to commercialize our product candidates 
our product candidates under development are subject to extensive domestic and foreign regulation 
the fda regulates  among other things  the development  testing  manufacture  safety  efficacy  record keeping  labeling  storage  approval  advertisement  promotion  sale and distribution of pharmaceutical products in the united states 
if 
table of contents we market our products abroad  they are also subject to extensive regulation by foreign governments 
none of our product candidates have been approved for sale in the united states or any foreign market 
in the united states  a separate nda or supplement must be filed with respect to each indication for which marketing approval of a product is sought 
each nda  in turn  requires the successful completion of preclinical  toxicology  genotoxicity and carcinogenicity studies  as well as clinical trials demonstrating the safety and efficacy of the product for that particular indication 
we may not receive regulatory approval of any of the ndas that we file with the fda 
if we are unable to obtain and maintain fda and foreign governmental approvals for our product candidates  we  alone or through our collaborators  will not be permitted to sell them 
approval of a product candidate may be conditioned upon certain limitations and restrictions as to the drug s use  or upon the conduct of further studies  and is subject to continuous review 
the fda may also require us to conduct additional post approval studies 
these post approval studies may include carcinogenicity studies in animals or further human clinical trials 
the later discovery of previously unknown problems with the product  manufacturer or manufacturing facility may result in criminal prosecution  civil penalties  recall or seizure of products  or total or partial suspension of production  as well as other regulatory action against our product candidates or us 
if approvals are withdrawn for a product  or if a product is seized or recalled  we would be unable to sell that product and our revenues would suffer 
we and our contract manufacturers are required to comply with the applicable fda current good manufacturing practices cgmp regulations  which include requirements relating to quality control and quality assurance  as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation 
further  manufacturing facilities must be approved by the fda before they can be used to manufacture our product candidates  and are subject to additional fda inspection 
we  or our third party manufacturers  may not be able to comply with cgmp regulations or other fda regulatory requirements  which could result in a delay or an inability to manufacture the products 
labeling and promotional activities are subject to scrutiny by the fda and state regulatory agencies and  in some circumstances  the federal trade commission 
fda enforcement policy prohibits the marketing of unapproved products as well as the marketing of approved products for unapproved  or off label  uses 
these regulations and the fda s interpretation of them may impair our ability to effectively market products for which we gain approval 
failure to comply with these requirements can result in regulatory enforcement action by the fda 
further  we may not obtain the labeling claims we believe are necessary or desirable for the promotion of our product candidates 
with respect to mt  although we intend to submit a response to the comments we received on our maa filed in the united kingdom from the advisory group to the mhra  no assurance can be given that we will be able to satisfactorily address these issues  including providing additional support for the benefits of the mt combination 
similarly  although we are currently working with the fda to revisit the determination made in its not approvable letter issued in october relating to the nda we filed for mt  no assurance can be given that regulatory approval will be received 
our need to collaborate with third parties to develop and commercialize our products may result in delays in product development and lost revenues  restricting our ability to commercialize our products 
under our current strategy  and for the foreseeable future  we expect to depend upon collaborations with third parties to develop our product candidates and we expect to depend substantially upon third parties to commercialize our products 
as a result  our ability to develop  obtain regulatory approval of  manufacture and commercialize our existing and any future product candidates depends upon our ability to maintain existing  and enter into and maintain new  contractual and collaborative arrangements with others 
we also engage  and intend in the future to continue to engage  contract manufacturers and clinical trial investigators 
in addition  the identification of new compounds or product candidates for development has led us  and may continue to require us  to enter into licensing or other collaborative agreements with others  including pharmaceutical companies and research institutions 
collaborative agreements for the acquisition of new compounds or product candidates may require us to pay license fees  make milestone payments and or pay royalties 
furthermore  these agreements may result in our revenues being lower than if we developed our product candidates ourselves and in our loss of control over the development of our product candidates 

table of contents in addition  we currently have a collaboration with gsk for the development and commercialization of certain triptan combinations using our mt technology in the united states and collaborations with nycomed in the nordic countries and xcel in the united states for the development and commercialization of mt and mt  respectively 
in all of these collaboration agreements  our licensees have termination rights under certain provisions in the agreements 
if we do not maintain these collaborations  or if we are not able to establish additional research and development collaborations or licensing arrangements  it will be difficult for us to develop and commercialize these and our other product candidates 
any future collaborations or licensing arrangements may not be on terms favorable to us 
our current or any future collaborations or licensing arrangements ultimately may not be successful 
our agreements with collaborators typically allow them some discretion in electing whether to pursue such activities 
if any collaborator were to breach or terminate its agreement with us or otherwise fail to conduct collaborative activities in a timely or successful manner  the pre clinical or clinical development or commercialization of our product candidates or research programs would be delayed or terminated 
any delay or termination of clinical development or commercialization would delay or eliminate potential product revenues 
other risks associated with contractual and collaborative arrangements with others include the following we may not have day to day control over the activities of our contractors or collaborators 
third parties may not fulfill their regulatory or other obligations 
we may not realize the contemplated or expected benefits from collaborative or other arrangements 
business combinations and changes in the contractors or their business strategy may adversely affect their willingness or ability to complete their obligations to us 
the contractor or collaborator may have the right to terminate its arrangements with us on limited or no notice and for reasons outside of our control 
the contractor or collaborator may develop or have rights to competing products or product candidates and may withdraw support or cease to perform work on our products 
disagreements may arise regarding a breach of the arrangement  ownership of proprietary rights  clinical results or regulatory approvals 
these factors could lead to delays in the development of our product candidates  and or the commercialization of our products  and disagreements with our contractors or collaborators could require or result in litigation or arbitration  which would be time consuming and expensive 
our ultimate success may depend upon the success and performance on the part of these third parties 
if we fail to maintain these relationships or establish new relationships as required  development of our product candidates and or the commercialization of our products will be delayed 
we need to maintain current agreements and enter into additional agreements with third parties that possess sales  marketing and distribution capabilities  or establish internally the capability to perform these functions  in order to successfully market and sell our future drug products 
we have no sales or distribution personnel or capabilities 
if we are unable to maintain current collaborations or enter into additional collaborations with established pharmaceutical or pharmaceutical services companies to provide those capabilities  or alternatively  we are unable to develop internally sales and distribution capabilities  we will not be able to successfully commercialize our products 
to the extent that we enter into marketing and sales agreements with third parties  our revenues  if any  will be affected by the sales and marketing efforts of those third parties 
further  we cannot guarantee that  should we elect to develop our own sales and distribution capabilities  we would have sufficient resources to do so  or would be able to hire the qualified sales and marketing personnel we would need 
we need to conduct preclinical  toxicology  genotoxicity and carcinogenicity studies and clinical trials on our product candidates 
any unanticipated costs or delays in these studies or trials  or the need to conduct additional studies or trials or to seek to persuade the fda to evaluate the results of a study or trial in a different manner  could reduce or delay our revenues and profitability 
generally  we must demonstrate the efficacy and safety of our product candidates before approval to market can be obtained from the fda or the regulatory authorities in other countries 
our existing and future product candidates 
table of contents are and will be in various stages of clinical development 
depending upon the stage of the development process of a product candidate  we will need to complete preclinical  toxicology  genotoxicity and carcinogenicity studies  as well as clinical trials  on these product candidates before we submit marketing applications in the united states and abroad 
these studies and trials can be very costly and time consuming 
in addition  we rely on third parties to perform significant aspects of our studies and clinical trials  introducing additional sources of risk into our development programs 
it should also be noted that results from preclinical testing and early clinical trials are not necessarily predictive of results obtained in later clinical trials involving large scale testing of patients in comparison to control groups 
the completion of clinical trials depends upon many factors  including the rate of enrollment of patients 
if we are unable to recruit sufficient clinical patients during the appropriate period  we may need to delay our clinical trials and incur significant additional costs 
we also rely on the compliance of our clinical trial investigators with fda regulatory requirements and noncompliance can result in disqualification of a clinical trial investigator and data that is unusable 
in addition  the fda or institutional review boards may require us to conduct additional trials or delay  restrict or discontinue our clinical trials on various grounds  including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk 
even though we may have completed all planned clinical trials for a product candidate and submitted an nda for such product candidate  as we have for mt and mt  the fda may require us to conduct additional clinical trials and studies to support our ndas 
we may determine that it would be necessary to seek to persuade the fda to evaluate the results of a study or trial in a manner that differs from the way the fda usually evaluates results 
for example  we are working with the fda to seek to resolve the fda s issues in its not approvable letter relating to the nda for mt issued in october in addition  we may have unexpected results that require us to reconsider the need for certain studies or trials 
for example  results from a genotoxicity study involving mt may require us to conduct chronic toxicology and carcinogenicity studies 
once submitted  an nda requires fda approval before we can distribute or commercialize the product described in the application 
even if we determine that data from our clinical trials  toxicology  genotoxicity and carcinogenicity studies are positive  we cannot assure you that the fda  after completing its analysis  will not determine that the trials or studies should have been conducted or analyzed differently  and thus reach a different conclusion from that reached by us  or request that further trials  studies or analyses be conducted 
for example  we believe the results of the recently completed mt two year rat carcinogenicity study provided no evidence that the concomitant administration of maximum tolerated doses of metoclopramide and naproxen  the two active components in mt  produced any statistically significant differences in findings from those seen with metoclopramide alone 
we cannot assure you that the fda  after completing its analysis  will not reach a different conclusion from that reached by us 
similarly  the fda may require data in certain subpopulations  such as pediatric use  or if such studies were not previously completed  may require long term carcinogenicity studies  prior to nda approval  unless we can obtain a waiver of such a requirement 
we face similar regulatory hurdles in other countries to those that we face in the united states 
for example  no assurance can be given that we will be able to satisfactorily address the issues related to mt raised in september by the advisory group to the mhra  including providing additional support for the benefits of the mt combination 
our costs associated with our human clinical trials vary based on a number of factors  including the order and timing of clinical indications pursued  the extent of development and financial support from collaborative parties  if any  the need to conduct additional clinical trials or studies  the number of patients required for enrollment  the difficulty of obtaining sufficient patient populations and clinicians  the difficulty of obtaining clinical supplies of our product candidates  and governmental and regulatory delays 
even if we obtain positive preclinical or clinical study results initially  future clinical trial results may not be similarly positive 
we currently depend and will in the future depend on third parties to manufacture our product candidates 
if these manufacturers fail to meet our requirements or any regulatory requirements  the product development and commercialization of our product candidates will be delayed 
we do not have  and have no plans to develop  the internal capability to manufacture either clinical trial or commercial quantities of products that we may develop or have under development 
we rely upon third party manufacturers to supply us with our product candidates 
we also need supply contracts to sell our products commercially 
there is no guarantee that manufacturers that enter into commercial supply contracts with us will be 
table of contents financially viable entities going forward  or will not otherwise breach or terminate their agreements with us 
if we do not have the necessary commercial supply contracts  or if our current manufacturer is  or any of our future manufacturers are  unable to satisfy our requirements or meet any regulatory requirements  and we are required to find alternative sources of supply  there may be additional costs and delays in product development and commercialization of our product candidates or we may be required to comply with additional regulatory requirements 
if our competitors develop and commercialize products faster than we do or if their products are superior to ours  our commercial opportunities will be reduced or eliminated 
our product candidates will have to compete with existing and any newly developed migraine therapies or therapies for any newly developed product candidates for treatment of other diseases 
there are also likely to be numerous competitors developing new products to treat migraine and the other diseases and conditions for which we may seek to develop products in the future  which could render our product candidates or technologies obsolete or non competitive 
our primary competitors will likely include large pharmaceutical companies  biotechnology companies  universities and public and private research institutions 
we face  and will continue to face  intense competition from other companies for securing collaborations with pharmaceutical companies  establishing relationships with academic and research institutions  and acquiring licenses to proprietary technology 
these competitors  either alone or with collaborative parties  may succeed with technologies or products that are more effective than any of our current or future technologies or products 
many of our actual or potential competitors  either alone or together with collaborative parties  have substantially greater financial resources  and almost all of our competitors have larger numbers of scientific and administrative personnel than we do 
many of these competitors  either alone or together with their collaborative parties  also have significantly greater experience than we do in developing product candidates  undertaking preclinical testing and human clinical trials  obtaining fda and other regulatory approvals of product candidates  and manufacturing and marketing products 
accordingly  our actual or potential competitors may succeed in obtaining patent protection  receiving fda approval or commercializing products before we do 
our competitors may also develop products or technologies that are superior to those that we are developing  and render our product candidates or technologies obsolete or non competitive 
if we cannot successfully compete with new or existing products  our marketing and sales will suffer and we may not ever be profitable 
if we are unable to protect our patents or proprietary rights  or if we are unable to operate our business without infringing the patents and proprietary rights of others  we may be unable to develop our product candidates or compete effectively 
the pharmaceutical industry places considerable importance on obtaining patent and trade secret protection for new technologies  products and processes 
our success will depend  in part  on our ability  and the ability of our licensors  to obtain and to keep protection for our products and technologies under the patent laws of the united states and other countries  so that we can stop others from using our inventions 
our success also will depend on our ability to prevent others from using our trade secrets 
in addition  we must operate in a way that does not infringe  or violate  the patent  trade secret and other intellectual property rights of other parties 
we cannot know how much protection  if any  our patents will provide or whether our patent applications will issue as patents 
the breadth of claims that will be allowed in patent applications cannot be predicted and neither the validity nor enforceability of claims in issued patents can be assured 
if  for any reason  we are unable to obtain and enforce valid claims covering our products and technology  we may be unable to prevent competitors from using the same or similar technology or to prevent competitors from marketing identical products 
in addition  due to the extensive time needed to develop and test our products  any patents that we obtain may expire in a short time after commercialization 
this would reduce or eliminate any advantages that such patents may give us 

table of contents we may need to license rights to third party patents and intellectual property to continue the development and marketing of our product candidates 
if we are unable to acquire such rights on acceptable terms  our development activities may be blocked and we may be unable to bring our product candidates to market 
we may enter into litigation to defend ourselves against claims of infringement  assert claims that a third party is infringing one or more of our patents  protect our trade secrets or know how  or determine the scope and validity of others patent or proprietary rights 
as a result of such litigation  our patent claims may be found to be invalid  unenforceable or not of sufficient scope to cover the activities of an alleged infringer 
if we are found to infringe the patent rights of others  then we may be forced to pay damages sufficient to irreparably harm the company and or be prevented from continuing our product development and marketing activities 
regardless of its eventual outcome  any lawsuit that we enter into may consume time and resources that will impair our ability to develop and market our product candidates 
we have entered into confidentiality agreements with our employees  consultants  advisors and collaborators 
however  these parties may not honor these agreements and  as a result  we may not be able to protect our rights to unpatented trade secrets and know how 
others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets and know how 
also  many of our scientific and management personnel were previously employed by competing companies 
as a result  such companies may allege trade secret violations and similar claims against us 
if we fail to acquire  develop and commercialize additional products or product candidates  or fail to successfully promote or market approved products  we may never achieve profitability 
as part of our business strategy  we plan to identify  self invent and acquire product candidates or approved products in areas in which we possess particular knowledge 
because we do not directly engage in basic research or drug discovery  we may rely upon third parties to sell or license product opportunities to us 
other companies  including some with substantially greater financial  marketing and sales resources  are competing with us to acquire such products 
we may not be able to acquire rights to additional products on acceptable terms  if at all 
in addition  we may acquire new products with different marketing strategies  distribution channels and bases of competition than those of our current products 
therefore  we may not be able to compete favorably in those product categories 
none of our future products may be accepted by the market 
even if our product candidates perform successfully in clinical trials and are approved by the fda and other regulatory authorities  our future products may not achieve market acceptance and may not generate the revenues that we anticipate 
the degree of market acceptance will depend upon a number of factors  including the receipt and timing of regulatory approvals  the availability of third party reimbursement  the indications for which the product is approved  the rate of adoption by healthcare providers  the rate of product acceptance by target patient populations  the price of the product relative to alternative therapies  the availability of alternative therapies  the extent and effectiveness of marketing efforts by us and third party distributors and agents  the publicity regarding our products or similar products  and the extent and severity of side effects as compared to alternative therapies 

table of contents if we do not receive adequate third party reimbursements for our future products  our revenues and profitability will be reduced 
our ability to commercialize our product candidates successfully will depend  in part  on the extent to which reimbursement for the costs of such products and related treatments will be available from government health administration authorities  such as medicare and medicaid in the united states  private health insurers and other organizations 
significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of a newly approved healthcare product  particularly for indications for which there is no current effective treatment or for which medical care is typically not sought 
adequate third party coverage may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product research and development 
if adequate coverage and reimbursement levels are not provided by government and third party payors for use of our products  our products may fail to achieve market acceptance 
our future revenues  profitability and access to capital will be affected by the continuing efforts of governmental and private third party payors to contain or reduce the costs of healthcare through various means 
we expect that a number of federal  state and foreign proposals will seek to control the cost of drugs through governmental regulation 
we are unsure of the form that any healthcare reform legislation may take or what actions federal  state  foreign and private payors may take in response to the proposed reforms 
therefore  we cannot predict the effect of any implemented reform on our business 
if product liability lawsuits are successfully brought against us  we may incur substantial liabilities and may be required to limit commercialization of our product candidates 
the testing and marketing of pharmaceutical products entails an inherent risk of product liability 
product liability claims might be brought against us by consumers  healthcare providers  pharmaceutical companies or others selling our future products 
if we cannot successfully defend ourselves against such claims  we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit the commercialization of our product candidates 
we have obtained limited product liability insurance coverage only for our human clinical trials 
however  insurance coverage is becoming increasingly expensive  and no assurance can be given that we will be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to liability 
we may not be able to obtain commercially reasonable product liability insurance for any products approved for marketing 
if a plaintiff brings a successful product liability claim against us in excess of our insurance coverage  if any  we may incur substantial liabilities and our business may fail 
we may need additional funding and may not have access to capital 
if we are unable to raise capital when needed  we may need to delay  reduce or eliminate our product development or commercialization efforts 
we may need to raise additional funds to execute our business strategy 
we have incurred losses from operations since inception and we may continue to incur additional operating losses 
our actual capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including the progress of our research and development programs  the progress of preclinical studies  clinical and other testing  the time and cost involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the costs of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the effect of competing technological and market developments  the timing of our receipt  if any  of milestone payments and royalties under collaborative agreements  the effect of changes and developments in  or termination of  our collaborative  licensing and other relationships  the terms and timing of any additional collaborative  licensing and other arrangements that we may establish  and our ability to arrange for the commercialization of our product candidates 
we may be unable to raise sufficient funds to execute our business strategy 
in addition  we may not be able to find sufficient debt or equity funding on acceptable terms 
if we cannot  we may need to delay  reduce or eliminate research and development programs 

table of contents the sale by us of additional equity securities or the expectation that we will sell additional equity securities may have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock 
in addition  collaborative arrangements may require us to grant product development programs or licenses to third parties for products that we might otherwise seek to develop or commercialize ourselves 
we depend on key personnel and may not be able to retain these employees or recruit additional qualified personnel  which would harm our research and development efforts 
we are highly dependent on the efforts of our key management and scientific personnel  especially john r 
plachetka  pharmd  our chairman  president and chief executive officer 
dr 
plachetka signed an employment agreement with us on april   as amended and restated on july   for a three year term with automatic one year renewal terms 
as of july   we also entered into employment agreements with certain of our other key management personnel  each of which provides for a two year term with automatic one year renewal terms 
if we lose the services of dr 
plachetka or the services of any of our other key personnel  or are unable to replace the services of our key personnel who may leave the company  or if we fail to recruit other key scientific personnel  we may be unable to achieve our business objectives 
there is intense competition for qualified scientific personnel 
since our business is very science oriented  we need to continue to attract and retain such people 
we may not be able to continue to attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary for developing our business 
furthermore  our future success may also depend in part on the continued service of our other key management personnel 
factors that may affect our stockholders our stock price is volatile  which may result in significant losses to stockholders 
there has been significant volatility in the market prices of biotechnology companies securities and in the market price of our common stock 
various factors and events may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock  including fluctuations in our operating results  announcements of technological innovations  acquisitions or licensing of therapeutic products or product candidates by us or our competitors  published reports by securities analysts  positive or negative progress with our clinical trials or with regulatory approvals of our product candidates  governmental regulation  including reimbursement policies  developments in patent or other proprietary rights  developments in our relationships with collaborative partners  public concern as to the safety and efficacy of our products  and general market conditions 
the trading price of our common stock has been  and could continue to be  subject to wide fluctuations in response to these and other factors 
from october   when our common stock began trading on the nasdaq national market  through december   the high and low closing prices of our common stock ranged from to 
broad market fluctuations may also adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our proceeds from our initial public offering  private placements and collaboration agreements have been invested in money market funds that invest primarily in short term  highly rated investments  including us government securities  commercial paper and certificates of deposit guaranteed by banks 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage our exposure to interest rate changes 
because of the short term maturities of our investments  we do not believe that a decrease in market rates would have a significant negative impact on the value of our investment portfolio 
however  declines in interest rates reduced our interest income in as compared to the same period of
