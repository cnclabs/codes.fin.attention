item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following should be read in conjunction with cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements and our combined consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this form k 
operating results factors affecting operating results our results of operations are affected by the following key factors in each of our business divisions agribusiness in the agribusiness division  we purchase  store  process  transport  sell and finance agricultural commodities  principally soy commodity products 
in this division  profitability is principally affected by the relative prices of soy commodity products and the volatility of the prices for these products 
profitability is also affected by energy costs  as we use a substantial amount of energy in the operation of our facilities  and by the availability and cost of transportation and logistic services  including truck  barge and rail services 
prices  in turn  are affected by the perceived and actual supply of  and demand for  soy commodity products 
availability is affected by weather conditions  governmental trade policies and growing patterns  including substitution by farmers of other agricultural commodities for soybeans 
demand is affected by growth in worldwide consumption of food products and the price of substitute agricultural products 
global soybean meal consumption grew by approximately per year on average over the last years 
we expect that population growth and rising standards of living will continue to have a positive impact on global demand for our agribusiness products 
from time to time  there may be imbalances between industry wide levels of oilseed processing capacity and demand for soy commodity products 
prices for soy commodity products are affected by these imbalances  which in turn affects demand for them and our decisions regarding whether and when to purchase  store  process  transport or sell these commodities  including whether to reduce our own oilseed processing capacity 
for instance  in march  we announced that we will temporarily idle production at our soybean processing facility in destrehan  louisiana due to increased us exports of soybean meal and a smaller than anticipated us soybean crop due to adverse weather conditions 
fertilizer in the fertilizer division  demand for our products is affected by the profitability of the brazilian agricultural sector  agricultural commodity prices  the types of crops planted  the number of acres planted and weather related issues affecting the success of the harvest 
for the past ten years the brazilian fertilizer industry has grown on average at a rate of over per year 
the continued growth of the brazilian agricultural sector has had  and we expect will continue to have  a positive impact on demand for our fertilizer products 
in addition  our selling prices are influenced by international selling prices for imported fertilizers and raw materials  such as phosphate  ammonia and urea  as our products are priced to import parity 
food products in the food products division  which consists of our edible oil products and milling products segments  our operations are affected by competition  changes in eating habits and changes in general economic conditions in europe  the united states and brazil  the principal markets for our food products division 
competition in this industry has intensified in the past several years due to consolidation in the supermarket industry and attempts by our competitors to increase market share 
profitability in this division is also affected by the mix of products that we sell 
foreign currency exchange rates translation of foreign currency financial statements 
our reporting currency is the us dollar 
however  the functional currency of the majority of our foreign subsidiaries is their local currency 
we translate the amounts included in the consolidated statements of income of our foreign subsidiaries into us dollars on a monthly basis at weighted average exchange rates  which we believe approximates the actual exchange rates on the dates of the transactions 
our foreign subsidiaries assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars from local currency at year end exchange rates  and we record the resulting foreign exchange translation adjustments in our consolidated balance sheets as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
included in other comprehensive income for the year ended december  were foreign exchange net translation gains of million representing the net gains from the translation of our foreign subsidiaries assets and liabilities 
included in other comprehensive loss for the year ended december  and were foreign exchange net translation losses of million and million  respectively  representing the net loss from the translation of our foreign subsidiaries assets and liabilities 
foreign currency transactions 
certain of our foreign subsidiaries  most significantly in brazil and argentina  have monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in us dollars 
these us dollar monetary items are remeasured into their respective functional currencies at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date 
the resulting gains or losses are included in our consolidated statements of income as foreign exchange gains or losses 
due to the global nature of our operations  our operating results are vulnerable to foreign exchange rate changes 
however  our agricultural commodities inventories  because of their international pricing in us dollars  provide a natural hedge to our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
historically  our fertilizer and food product divisions also have been able to link sales prices to those of us dollar linked imported raw material costs  thereby minimizing the effect of exchange rate fluctuations in those segments 
argentina and brazil 
the volatility of the argentine peso and brazilian real has affected our and financial performance 
devaluations of these currencies against the us dollar generally have a positive effect on our results when local currency costs are translated to us dollars at weaker real or peso to dollar exchange rates 
in addition  commodity inventories in our agribusiness segment are stated at market value  which is generally linked to us dollar based international prices 
as a result  devaluations cause gains based on the changes in the local currency value of the agribusiness inventories 
conversely  devaluations generate offsetting net foreign exchange losses on the net us dollar monetary position of our brazilian and argentine subsidiaries  which are reflected in foreign exchange losses in our consolidated statements of income 
our effective tax rate is also favorably affected by the devaluation of the brazilian real as we recognize tax benefits related to foreign exchange losses on certain long term intercompany loans 
appreciations generally have a corresponding negative effect on our results when local currency costs are translated to us dollars at stronger real or peso to us dollar exchange rates and losses are generated based on changes in the local currency value of our agribusiness segment commodity inventories 
conversely  the appreciation generates offsetting net foreign exchange gains on the net us dollar monetary position of our brazilian and argentine subsidiaries  which are reflected in foreign exchange gains in our consolidated statements of income 
our effective tax rate is unfavorably affected by the appreciation of the brazilian real as we incur income taxes related to foreign exchange gains on certain intercompany loans 
the real and peso appreciated and  respectively  against the us dollar in the year ended december   compared to a devaluation of and  respectively  in the same period in our results included exchange gains of million and net exchange losses of million in relating to our brazilian and argentine subsidiaries 
we use long term intercompany loans to reduce our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations in brazil  particularly their effects on our results of operations 
these loans do not require cash payment of principal and are treated as analogous to equity for accounting purposes 
as a result  the foreign exchange gains or losses on these intercompany loans are recorded in other comprehensive income loss in contrast to foreign exchange gains or losses on third party debt and short term intercompany debt  which are recorded in foreign exchange gains losses in our consolidated statements of income 
european operations 
we operate in the eu and several countries that are not members of the eu 
our risk management policy is to fully hedge our monetary exposures in those countries to minimize the financial effects of fluctuations in the euro and other european currencies 
acquisitions  dispositions and alliances acquisition of cereol 
in  we acquired of the shares of cereol sa and in april  we acquired the remaining of the shares of cereol  resulting in ownership of cereol for million in cash net of cash acquired of million 
cereol s results of operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements since october  we accounted for the acquisition under the purchase method 
alliance with dupont 
in april  we entered into an alliance with dupont and together formed solae by contributing dupont s protein technologies business and our north american and european soy ingredients operations 
solae is a soy ingredients joint venture and a key component in our broader strategic alliance with dupont 
we have a interest in solae 
in may   we sold our brazilian soy ingredients operations to solae for million in cash  net of sale related expenses of approximately million 
we recognized a tax free gain on sale of million in the second quarter of relating to this sale 
we used the proceeds from the sale to reduce indebtedness 
as a result of these transactions  our consolidated balance sheet at december  reflects a long term investment in solae  which is accounted for under the equity method 
saipol joint venture 
in july  we sold lesieur  a french producer of branded bottled vegetable oils  to saipol  an oilseed processing joint venture between bunge and sofiproteol 
we received approximately million in cash  which included the repayment of lesieur s intercompany debt owed to us of million  and a note receivable from saipol of million 
we own of saipol  which we account for under the equity method 
we did not recognize a gain or loss on the sale 
the proceeds from the sale were used to reduce outstanding indebtedness 
the million note receivable is due july with interest payable annually at a rate of sale of us bakery business 
in december  we sold our us bakery business to dawn food products  inc the total cash proceeds from the transaction were approximately million  including an adjustment for working capital 
we recognized a gain on the sale of million net of tax in the fourth quarter of that is included in discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of income 
we used the net proceeds from the sale to reduce outstanding indebtedness 
income taxes as a bermuda exempted company  we are not subject to income taxes in our jurisdiction of incorporation 
however  our subsidiaries  which operate in multiple tax jurisdictions  are subject to income taxes at various statutory rates 
in  the sale of our brazilian soy ingredients business to solae for a gain of million did not result in taxable income and therefore no income tax was provisioned 
however  we have recorded a net tax expense of million relating to new tax laws in south america 
our us export sales of agricultural commodities and certain food products have been subject to favorable us tax treatment on export sales through the use of a us foreign sales corp 
fsc 
beginning in  due to the repeal of the fsc  we were required to use the tax provisions of the extraterritorial income eti exclusion  which was substantially similar to the fsc 
this tax treatment lowered our overall tax liabilities and thereby reducing our income tax expense by million in  million in and million in the us congress is considering legislation to repeal the eti and propose a new tax incentive for certain domestic manufacturers  which could subject us exporters  including us  to higher tax rates 
we will continue to monitor the us legislation and determine its effects as the legislation continues to develop 
in  the argentine government enacted a new tax law affecting exporters of certain products  including grains and oilseeds 
the law generally provides that in certain circumstances when an export is made to a related party that is not the final purchaser of the exported products  the income tax payable by the exporter with respect to such sales must be based on the greater of the contract price of the exported products or the market price of the products at the date of shipment 
the argentine government has not yet issued interpretive regulations regarding the application and scope of this law 
we will continue to monitor developments with respect to this legislation and any effect that it may have on our consolidated financial statements 
inflation inflation did not have a material impact on our business in  or critical accounting policies and estimates we believe that the application of the following accounting policies  which are important to our financial position and results of operations  requires significant judgments and estimates on the part of management 
for a summary of all of our accounting policies  including the accounting policies discussed below  see note of our consolidated financial statements included in part iii to this annual report 
recoverable taxes we evaluate the collectibility of our recoverable taxes and record valuation allowances if we determine that collection is doubtful 
recoverable taxes primarily represent value added taxes paid on the acquisition of raw materials and other services which can be recovered in cash or as compensation of outstanding balances against income taxes or certain other taxes we may owe 
in  we commenced recording valuation allowances against certain recoverable taxes owed to us by the argentine government due to delayed payment and uncertainty regarding the local economic environment 
management s assumption about the collectibility of recoverable taxes requires significant judgment because it involves an assessment of the ability and willingness of the argentine government to refund the taxes 
the balance of these allowances fluctuates depending on the sales activity of existing inventories  purchases of new inventories  seasonality  changes in applicable tax rates  cash payment by the argentine government and compensation of outstanding balances against income or certain other taxes owed to the argentine government 
at december  and  our allowances for recoverable taxes were million and million  respectively 
the balance declined from december  to december   as a result of either cash received by us or compensation against taxes owed by us to the argentine government 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of costs of businesses acquired over the fair market value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
 requires that goodwill be tested for impairment annually 
in assessing the recovery of goodwill  projections regarding estimated discounted future cash flows and other factors are used to determine the fair value of the reporting units and the respective assets 
these projections are based on historical data  anticipated market conditions and management plans 
if these estimates or related projections change in the future  we may be required to record additional impairment charges 
in the fourth quarter of  we performed our annual impairment test and an impairment charge of million was recorded on goodwill relating to our austrian oilseed processing operations 
the write down resulted from deterioration in the operating environment due to increases in raw material and freight costs and increased competitive pressure 
no other impairment charges resulted from the required impairment evaluations on the rest of our reporting units 
intangible assets and long lived assets long lived assets include property  plant and equipment and identifiable intangible assets 
when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of long lived assets may be impaired  an evaluation of recoverability is performed by comparing the carrying value of the assets to the projected future cash flows to be generated by such assets 
if it appears that the carrying value of our assets is not recoverable  we recognize an impairment loss as a charge against results of operations 
our judgments related to the expected useful lives of long lived assets and our ability to realize undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amount of such assets are affected by factors such as the ongoing maintenance of the assets  changes in economic conditions and changes in operating performance 
as we assess the ongoing expected cash flows and carrying amounts of our long lived assets  changes in these factors could cause us to realize material impairment charges 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a pre tax impairment charge in our agribusiness segment of million relating to fixed assets of our european oilseed processing facilities 
these facilities are older  less efficient crushing facilities  and are largely dependent on soybeans imported from north and south america for production 
the european oilseed operations experienced operating losses during during the fourth quarter  we updated our operating forecast to include the effects of certain events occurring in the fourth quarter  including the shortfall in north american soy crop  increased export tariffs for brazilian soy exports and increased freight rates 
furthermore  we determined that maintenance capital expenditures for the facilities would be substantially higher than previously forecasted 
as a result of these factors  we tested the assets for impairment based on an undiscounted cash flow model and determined that these cash flows would not recover the carrying value of the assets 
the impairment was measured based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeded the discounted cash flows 
contingencies we are a party to a large number of claims and lawsuits  primarily tax and labor claims in brazil  arising in the normal course of business  and have accrued our estimate of the probable costs to resolve these claims 
this estimate has been developed in consultation with in house and outside counsel and is based on an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies relating to these proceedings 
employee benefit plans we sponsor various pension and postretirement benefit plans 
in connection with the plans  we make various assumptions in the determination of projected benefit obligations and expense recognition related to pension and postretirement obligations 
key assumptions include discount rates  rates of return on plan assets  asset allocations and rates of future compensation increases 
management develops its assumptions based on its experience and by reference to market related data 
all assumptions are reviewed periodically and adjusted as necessary 
in  we lowered the weighted average discount rate assumption used to calculate projected benefit obligations under the plans from at december  to at december   largely based on decreases in us aa rated corporate bond rates with similar maturities 
us based plans represent approximately of total projected benefit obligations 
the weighted average rate of return assumption on assets of funded plans was also reduced from at december  to at december  and is based on average assumed asset allocations of equity securities and government and corporate debt securities 
in  the combination of a decline in assets and a decline in the discount rate caused us to record a minimum pension liability  which reduced shareholders equity by million  net of tax 
future recognition of additional minimum pension liabilities will depend primarily on the actual return on assets and the discount rate 
a one percentage point decrease in the assumed discount rate on our defined benefit pension plans would increase annual expense and the projected benefit obligation by million and million  respectively 
a one percentage point increase or decrease in the long term return assumptions on our defined benefit pension plan assets would increase or decrease annual pension expense by million 
income taxes we record valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that we are likely to realize 
we consider future taxable income and prudent tax planning strategies to assess the need for and the size of the valuation allowances 
if we determine that we can realize a deferred tax asset in excess of our net recorded amount  we decrease the valuation allowance  thereby increasing net income 
conversely  if we determine that we are unable to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset  we increase the valuation allowance  thereby decreasing net income 
prior to recording a valuation allowance  our deferred tax assets were million at december  however  we have valuation allowances of million  principally representing the uncertainty regarding the recoverability of certain net operating loss carryforwards 
results of operations statements of income and segment presentation changes for the year ended december   we have made the following changes in the presentation of our consolidated statements of income and segment information interest income on advances to suppliers  which primarily include farmers  that was previously recorded as interest income and included in our consolidated statements of income  has been reclassified as a component of gross profit to reflect the operational nature of this income  interest income  interest expense  foreign exchange gains and losses and other income and expense  which were previously disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  are now individually disclosed on the face of the statements of income  and the presentation of segment information has been changed to include the financial costs of carrying operating working capital  including foreign exchange gains and losses  interest expense on debt financing working capital and interest income earned on working capital items  which is consistent with how management views the results for operational purposes 
prior year amounts have been reclassified to reflect these changes 
reclassifications in  we changed the name of our wheat milling and bakery products segment to milling products in connection with the sale of our us bakery business and reclassification of our corn milling products business line from the other segment to the milling products segment 
as a result  our other segment now reflects only the historical results of our soy ingredients business line  which we sold to solae in may therefore  we now have four reporting segments agribusiness  fertilizer  edible oil products and milling products 
the operating results of our us bakery business that we sold in have been reported as discontinued operations 
the amounts presented herein have been changed to reflect all of these reclassifications 
certain agribusiness activities of our canadian operations that were previously included in our edible oil products segment in were retroactively reclassified to the agribusiness segment to conform to the presentation 
overview fiscal year was the first full year of combined operations with cereol  which we acquired in october we increased sales volumes and net sales primarily due to the cereol acquisition and through organic growth 
our agribusiness division results through the third quarter of lagged behind the prior year because of weaknesses in north american and western european oilseed processing margins and a return to more normalized margins in south america 
in the united states  a poor harvest in was followed by a smaller harvest in  the smallest in seven years 
these reduced harvests put pressure on our north american and western european agribusiness segment soybean processing operations 
to address imbalances in us supply and demand  we temporarily idled two of our us oilseed processing facilities in the first half of in addition  we recorded million of pretax impairment charges on our long lived assets in europe 
as a result of changing harvest expectations and heightened concerns regarding mad cow infected livestock in the united states  the commodity markets during the third and fourth quarters of were also very volatile 
chicago board of trade cbot soybean product prices were near seven year highs  which caused a wave of farmer selling in north and south america late in the third and during the fourth quarters 
in the fourth quarter  customer demand was very strong  and margins improved 
in addition  our efficient global logistics system and competitive freight pricing helped offset record increases in freight rates in as a result  our fourth quarter agribusiness results significantly offset the weaker results experienced in the first three quarters of our fertilizer business was strong throughout the year  driven by higher international prices for imported raw materials  increases in planted acreage and well capitalized farmers in south america 
our edible oils business benefited from the acquisition of cereol and from efficiency programs in brazil and north america 
the geographic diversity of our operations mitigates risk to our business by lowering our exposure to any one market  region or product 
our results illustrate this diversification 
our net sales to external customers by geographic area were in north america  in south america  in europe and in asia 
segment results a summary of certain items in our consolidated statements of income and volumes by reportable segment for the periods indicated is set forth below 
year ended december  year ended december  us in millions  except volumes and percentages change change volumes in thousands of metric tons agribusiness    fertilizer    edible oil products    milling products    other soy ingredients total    net sales agribusiness    fertilizer    edible oil products   milling products other soy ingredients total    cost of goods sold agribusiness    fertilizer    edible oil products   milling products other soy ingredients total    gross profit agribusiness fertilizer edible oil products milling products other soy ingredients total   selling  general and administrative expenses agribusiness fertilizer edible oil products milling products other soy ingredients total foreign exchange gain loss agribusiness fertilizer edible oil products milling products other soy ingredients total interest income agribusiness fertilizer edible oil products milling products other soy ingredients total interest expense agribusiness fertilizer edible oil products milling products other soy ingredients total segment operating profit agribusiness fertilizer edible oil products milling products other soy ingredients total depreciation  depletion and amortization agribusiness fertilizer edible oil products milling products other soy ingredients total net income total segment operating profit is our consolidated income from continuing operations before income tax and minority interest that includes an allocated portion of the foreign exchange gains and losses relating to debt financing operating working capital  including readily marketable inventories 
also included in total segment operating profit is interest income and interest expense attributable to the financing of operating working capital 
total segment operating profit is a non gaap measure and is not intended to replace income from continuing operations before income tax and minority interest  the most directly comparable gaap measure 
total segment operating profit is a key performance measurement used by our management to evaluate whether our operating activities cover the financing costs of our business 
we believe total segment operating profit is a more complete measure of our operating profitability  since it allocates foreign exchange gains and losses and the cost of debt financing working capital to the appropriate operating segments 
additionally  we believe total segment operating profit assists investors by allowing them to evaluate changes in the operating results of our portfolio of businesses before non operating factors that affect net income 
total segment operating profit is not a measure of consolidated operating results under gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to income from continuing operations before income tax and minority interest or any other measure of consolidated operating results under gaap 
below is a reconciliation of income from continuing operations before income tax and minority interest to total segment operating profit year ended december  year ended december  us in millions  except percentages change change income from continuing operations before income tax and minority interest plus unallocated expenses net minus gain on sale of soy ingredients business total segment operating profit unallocated expenses net includes interest income  interest expense  foreign exchange gains and losses and other income and expense not directly attributable to our operating segments 
compared to agribusiness segment 
agribusiness segment net sales increased due to a increase in volumes and higher average selling prices for soy commodity products 
volumes increased due to organic growth and due to the acquisition of cereol 
soy commodity product prices increased sharply during the third and fourth quarters driven by the reduced us soybean crop 
heightened concerns relating to mad cow disease late in the fourth quarter also contributed to price increases 
cost of goods sold increased in from last year due to the increased volumes  increased raw material costs due to the tight united states old crop carryover  higher energy costs due to increases in gas prices and the october acquisition of cereol 
cost of goods sold in reflected commodity inventory mark to market losses in our brazilian and argentine subsidiaries that resulted from the appreciation of the real and peso of and  respectively  versus a devaluation of and  respectively  in which resulted in mark to market gains 
included in cost of goods sold in were million of non cash impairment charges on long lived assets in our european oilseed processing operations  a million decline in our allowances for recoverable taxes as a result of either cash received by us or compensation against taxes owed by us to the argentine government and a curtailment gain of million relating to the reduction of pension and postretirement healthcare benefits of certain us employees 
cost of goods sold in included a million charge relating to reserves for recoverable taxes from the argentine government 
gross profit decreased due to the increase in cost of goods sold 
agribusiness gross profit through the third quarter of lagged behind the prior year primarily because of weaknesses in north american and european oilseed processing margins and a return to more normal margins in south america 
these results were offset in part by improved margins in the fourth quarter of relating to effective risk management strategies  including ocean freight results 
the decline in gross profit was more than offset by changes in the foreign exchange results from a loss of million in to a gain of million in on the net monetary us dollar liability positions of our brazilian and argentine subsidiaries 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a increased primarily due to our acquisition of cereol and higher costs associated with the increase in sales volumes 
also included in sg a in was a non cash curtailment gain of million  relating to the reduction of pension and postretirement healthcare benefit liabilities for employees transferred to solae and the reduction of pension and postretirement healthcare benefit of certain us employees 
segment operating profit declined primarily due to the decrease in gross profit and increase in sg a partially offset by foreign exchange gains 
fertilizer segment 
fertilizer segment net sales increased due to higher average selling prices and an increase in volumes 
selling prices benefited from higher international selling prices for imported fertilizers and raw materials  such as phosphate  ammonia and urea  which helped boost local prices as products are priced to import parity 
international selling prices of phosphate  ammonia and urea increased  and  respectively  during our sales of retail fertilizer products were robust  as south american farmers increased their plantings of soybeans in reaction to higher soybean prices 
our nutrient sales volumes increased due to the increased demand for fertilizer raw materials 
cost of goods sold increased due to higher sales volumes and imported raw material costs 
however  the higher costs of imported raw materials were mitigated by our subsidiary  fosfertil s  lower raw material costs since fosfertil produces urea from raw materials not linked to international natural gas prices 
gross profit increased as a result of higher fertilizer selling prices and volumes offset partially by increases in imported raw material costs and the sale of lower margin products 
sg a increased due to certain labor contingencies  increases in information technology and institutional advertising expenses  appreciation in the value of the brazilian real and increases in transactional taxes 
segment operating profit increased primarily due to the increase in gross profit 
included an extra month of segment operating profit of million from fosfertil  which had been reporting its results one month in arrears 
edible oil products segment 
edible oil products segment net sales increased primarily due to a increase in volumes as a result of the cereol acquisition and organic growth in our south american operations 
cost of goods sold increased in from primarily due to the cereol acquisition and higher raw material costs  principally crude soybean oil 
included in cost of goods sold in was a non cash curtailment gain of million relating to the reduction of pension and postretirement healthcare benefits of certain us employees 
included in was a million non cash impairment charge on us long lived operating assets attributable to the planned disposal of a bottling facility 
gross profit increased primarily due to the cereol acquisition and a recovery of margins in our north and south american operations  principally in margarines and mayonnaise attributable to new branding and packaging strategies as well as portfolio rationalization measures 
sg a increased due to the cereol acquisition  partially offset by our cost reduction efforts in our south american operations 
in addition  in  sg a included a non cash curtailment gain of million  relating to the reduction of pension and postretirement healthcare benefits of certain us employees 
segment operating profit increased primarily due to the cereol acquisition and efficiency cost reduction programs in north america and brazil 
milling products segment 
milling products segment net sales increased due to higher average selling prices for wheat and corn milling products and a increase in volumes 
the increase in average selling prices was primarily due to higher raw material costs 
cost of goods sold increased due to higher wheat costs 
included in cost of goods sold in was a non cash curtailment gain of million  relating to the reduction of pension and postretirement healthcare benefits of certain us employees 
gross profit increased as a result of the higher average selling prices and volumes 
sg a decreased due to cost savings programs 
in addition  in  sg a included a non cash curtailment gain of million relating to the reduction of pension and postretirement healthcare benefits of certain us employees 
segment operating profit increased as a result of the improvement in gross profit  lower sg a and the october acquisition of a corn mill in the united states 
other segment soy ingredients 
our soy ingredients business was contributed to solae  our joint venture with dupont  in the second quarter of therefore  historical results are presented herein for comparative purposes 
financial costs 
a summary of consolidated financial costs for the periods indicated follows 
year ended december  us in millions  except percentages change interest income interest expense foreign exchange gain loss interest income increased due to interest income on higher invested cash in brazil where interest rates are higher 
also included million of interest income resulting from the completion of a tax examination relating to tax benefits associated with us export sales 
interest expense increased primarily due to higher average debt levels resulting from debt incurred to acquire cereol and our assumption of cereol s debt  partially offset by a reduction in interest expense due to more efficient use of working capital 
also  in the latter half of and in may and december  we issued long term debt at relatively higher interest rates to reduce our reliance on short term debt and finance the repayment of a portion of long term debt coming due 
foreign exchange gains were million in compared to losses of million last year due primarily to the appreciation in the value of the brazilian real in against the us dollar 
in contrast  in the value of the brazilian real declined by resulting in foreign exchange losses 
other 
other income and expense increased million to million in from million of income in primarily due to higher earnings from our joint ventures in argentina and the saipol joint venture acquired in the acquisition of cereol 
income tax expense 
income tax expense increased million to million in from million in primarily due to the increase in pretax income 
our effective tax rate for increased to compared to in excluding the tax free gain on sale of bunge s brazilian soy ingredients business to solae  the effective tax rate was 
our effective tax rate is affected by the geographic locations in which we do business  movements in foreign exchange rates and us tax incentives on export sales 
the primary causes of the increased effective tax rate in were the effect of a stronger brazilian real  and increased net tax expense of million due to new tax laws in south america and reduced tax benefits on us export sales 
in  our income tax expense was reduced by a million tax credit relating to the refund of prior years tax benefits on us export sales 
net income 
net income increased million to million in from million in net income for includes the million gain on sale of our brazilian soy ingredients business to solae 
net income for also included an after tax gain of million relating to the curtailment of certain pension and postretirement healthcare benefit plans and million of after tax impairment charges on long lived assets in europe 
in  discontinued operations included a loss of million  which included an environmental expense of million  net of tax  related to discontinued operations we sold in and a million  net of tax gain  on the us bakery business sold in december in  discontinued operations included income of million related to the bakery sale 
net income in included million of after tax impairment charges on long lived assets and charges recorded as cumulative effects of changes in accounting principles of million  net of tax  representing the write off of goodwill in the milling products segment as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and million  net of tax  related to the adoption of sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
compared to agribusiness segment 
agribusiness segment net sales increased due to a increase in volumes 
volumes increased due to a large south american crop  increased demand for soy commodity products and our acquisitions of cereol and la plata cereal 
cost of goods sold increased primarily due to increased volumes  partially offset by the effects of the devaluation of the brazilian real and argentine peso 
cost of goods sold in and reflected commodity inventory mark to market gains in our brazilian and argentine subsidiaries that resulted from the devaluation of the real and peso of and  respectively  in  and and  respectively  in gross profit increased primarily due to higher volumes  the devaluation of the brazilian real and argentine peso  favorable pricing and a large  quality crop in south america 
the increase was offset in part by the increase in cost of goods sold and a million non cash charge relating to the collectibility of recoverable taxes from the argentine government 
the increase in gross profit was partially offset by a million increase in foreign exchange losses 
sg a increased primarily due to the expansion of our business and the acquisitions of cereol and la plata cereal 
interest expense declined due to lower average interest rates and more efficient use of working capital 
segment operating profit increased due to the improvement in gross profit and the acquisition of cereol 
fertilizer segment 
fertilizer segment net sales increased primarily due to a increase in sales volumes  partially offset by lower average selling prices 
the increase in volumes was a result of increases in acreage planted  a large second crop in brazil that increased demand for raw materials  a strong export market for brazilian meat products that increased demand for animal nutrients and an extra month of results from fosfertil  which had been reporting its results one month in arrears 
the decline in average selling prices was due to high inventory levels and a competitive price environment due to low prices of imported raw materials 
cost of goods sold increased primarily due to increased volumes  partially offset by the brazilian real devaluation 
gross profit increased as a result of the higher sales volumes and million of gross profit  attributable to an extra month of results from fosfertil  partially offset by the increase in cost of goods sold and lower average selling prices 
sg a increased primarily due to the increase in sales volumes and the extra month of results from fosfertil 
sg a in included an million non recurring credit relating to brazilian health and welfare taxes 
segment operating profit increased primarily due to the improvements in gross profit and lower overall financial costs 
also included an extra month of segment operating profit of million from fosfertil 
edible oil products segment 
edible oil products segment net sales increased primarily due to the acquisition of cereol and organic growth 
cost of goods sold increased primarily due to increased volumes resulting from our acquisition of cereol and higher raw material costs  principally crude soybean oil 
gross profit increased primarily due to our acquisition of cereol 
sg a increased due to our acquisition of cereol  partially offset by our cost reduction efforts and the impact of the real devaluation on real denominated costs 
segment operating profit increased primarily due to our acquisition of cereol and organic growth 
milling products segment 
milling products segment net sales increased due to higher average selling prices 
the increase in average selling prices was largely due to a supply shortage in wheat milling products in brazil as competitors in financial difficulty lowered production  as well as a change in the product mix to higher priced products 
cost of goods sold was relatively flat

financial costs 
a summary of consolidated financial costs for the periods indicated follows 
year ended december  us in millions  except percentages change interest income interest expense foreign exchange loss interest income decreased due to lower average interest rates in brazil 
interest expense decreased because of lower interest rates and more efficient use of working capital  partially offset by an increase in interest expense due to higher debt levels resulting from debt incurred to acquire cereol and our assumption of cereol s debt 
foreign exchange losses increased primarily due to the larger devaluations of the brazilian real and the argentine peso against the us dollar in versus income tax expense 
income tax expense increased million to million in from million in primarily due to the increase in pretax income 
our effective tax rate for was versus in our effective tax rate decreased in from predominantly due to a million tax credit relating to the refund of prior years us foreign sales corporation benefits 
our effective tax rate was also favorably affected by the devaluation of the brazilian real as we recognized brazilian tax benefits related to foreign exchange losses 
minority interest 
minority interest expense increased million to million in from million primarily due to increased earnings at our less than wholly owned subsidiaries and our acquisition of cereol 
net income 
net income increased million to million in from million in as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and our completion of the transitional impairment test  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge in of million  net of tax  related mainly to goodwill in our bakery mixes business line of our wheat milling and bakery products segment 
in addition  subsequent to the adoption of sfas no 
 in the fourth quarter of  we recorded an additional goodwill impairment charge of million in cost of goods sold resulting from the loss of a customer in the milling products segment 
as a result of the early adoption of sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  effective as of january   we also recorded an asset retirement obligation charge of million  net of tax  as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
results on discontinued operations income of million in relates to the us bakery business sold in december net income in was positively affected by a million  net of tax  cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle related to the adoption of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
as a result of the adoption  commencing in  we began recording unrealized gains and losses on previously unrecognized forward and sales contracts as a component of cost of goods sold over the term of these contracts rather than on the delivery date for the underlying commodity 
in addition  we recorded a million gain on the disposal of our baked goods division in brazil  which we sold to a third party in march for million 
liquidity and capital resources our primary financial objective is to maintain sufficient liquidity through a conservative balance sheet to provide flexibility to pursue our growth objectives 
our current ratio  defined as current assets divided by current liabilities  was and at december  and  respectively 
cash and readily marketable inventories 
cash and cash equivalents were million at december  and million at december  at december   we had million of restricted cash  which is included in cash and cash equivalents  and is set aside as collateral against short term loans for our operations in europe 
included in our inventories were readily marketable commodity inventories of  million at december  and  million at december  these agricultural commodity inventories  which are financed primarily with debt  are readily convertible to cash because of their commodity characteristics  widely available markets and international pricing mechanisms 
the increase in readily marketable inventories was primarily due to higher prices and large farmer selling that occurred during december due to the dramatic increase in soybean commodity prices 
long and short term debt 
we conduct most of our financing activities at the parent company level 
we have a master trust facility designed to act as our central treasury and permit us and our subsidiaries to borrow long and short term debt on a more efficient basis 
the primary assets of the master trust facility consist of intercompany loans made to bunge limited and its subsidiaries 
bunge limited s wholly owned financing subsidiaries fund the master trust with long and short term debt obtained from third parties  including our commercial paper program 
to finance working capital  we use cash flows generated from operations and short term usually days maturity borrowings  including our commercial paper program  and various long term bank facilities and credit lines  which are sufficient to meet our business needs 
at december   we had million outstanding under our commercial paper program  which has a maximum available borrowing capacity of million 
our commercial paper program is our least expensive available short term funding source 
we maintain back up bank credit lines equal to the maximum capacity of our commercial paper program 
if we were unable to access the commercial paper market  we would use our bank credit lines  which would be at a higher cost than our commercial paper 
at december   we had approximately million of committed unused and available borrowing capacity under our commercial paper program and other short term lines of credit and approximately million of committed unused and available borrowing capacity under long term credit facilities  all of which are held through a number of lending institutions 
we expect our borrowings under these credit facilities and credit lines to increase in connection with our financing of commodity inventories due to higher prices 
our short term and long term debt decreased by million at december  from december  primarily due to the repayment of outstanding indebtedness with the million in net proceeds received from the sale of our brazilian soy ingredients business  lesieur and our us bakery business in and the proceeds from the repayment in by mutual investment limited of the remaining million principal amount of a note owed to us 
the repayment of debt was offset by a significant increase in debt in the fourth quarter  caused by the dramatic increase in soy commodity prices 
on may   we completed an offering of million aggregate principal amount of unsecured guaranteed senior notes due bearing interest at a rate of per year  to reduce further reliance on short term borrowings and to finance the repayment of the current portion of long term debt coming due 
on december   we completed an offering of million aggregate principal amount of unsecured guaranteed senior notes due bearing interest at a rate of per year 
the notes issued in may and december of were issued by our wholly owned finance subsidiary  bunge limited finance corp  and are guaranteed by us 
interest is payable semi annually in arrears on each of the notes 
on may   we entered into a million day revolving credit facility and a million year revolving credit facility to replace a million credit facility previously held by a subsidiary 
this credit facility was entered into by our wholly owned finance subsidiary  bunge finance europe bv  and is guaranteed by us 
there was million outstanding under the credit facility at december  through our subsidiaries  we have various other long term debt facilities at fixed and variable interest rates denominated in both us dollars  brazilian reais and euros  most of which mature between and at december   we had million outstanding under these long term debt facilities 
of this amount  at december   million was secured by certain land  property  equipment and export commodity contracts  as well as investments in our consolidated subsidiaries  having a net carrying value of million 
our long term debt agreements  commercial paper program  senior credit facilities and senior guaranteed notes require us to comply with specified financial covenants related to minimum net worth and working capital and a maximum long term debt to capitalization ratio 
we were in compliance with these covenants as of december  we do not have any ratings downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity of our debt 
however  a downgrade in our credit rating could adversely affect our ability to renew existing  or to obtain access to new  credit facilities in the future and would increase the cost of such facilities to us 
our credit ratings on our unsecured guaranteed senior notes by moody s investors service  inc at december  were baa with outlook positive  and bbb by standard poor s rating services and fitch rating services 
our commercial paper is rated a by standard poor s rating services  and p by moody s investors service  inc and the interest rates on our commercial paper borrowings are indexed to this rating 
redeemable preferred stock 
in december  bunge first capital limited  our consolidated subsidiary  issued  
par value shares of cumulative variable rate redeemable preferred shares to private investors for million 
cash dividends on our redeemable preferred stock are payable quarterly 
the amount of the dividend is calculated based on alternative benchmark financing rates  certain actual expenses and a return 
under the terms of the redeemable preferred stock  if more than one quarterly dividend is unpaid  and upon the occurrence of certain other events  including a material default on our indebtedness  the redeemable preferred stockholders may  among other things  require us to arrange for the sale of their redeemable preferred stock to third parties at a price based on the issue price of the redeemable preferred stock plus accrued and unpaid dividends  or require us to take other actions to protect their interests 
as of december   we have accrued million of current accrued quarterly dividends payable and we have no quarterly dividends in arrears 
equity 
shareholders equity increased to  million at december  from  million at december  as a result of net income of million  million received from mutual investment limited as a result of the repayment of a note owed to us  foreign exchange translation gains of million primarily generated by our european  brazilian and argentine subsidiaries and million attributable to the exercise of employee stock options 
this increase was partially offset by dividends paid to shareholders of million and other comprehensive losses of million 
guarantees we have issued or were a party to the following third party guarantees at december  us in millions maximum potential future payments operating lease residual values unconsolidated affiliates financing customer financing total we entered into synthetic lease agreements for barges and railcars originally owned by us and subsequently sold to third parties 
the leases are classified as operating leases 
any gains on the sales have been deferred and are being recognized ratably over the related lease terms 
we have the option at the end of each lease to purchase the barges or railcars at fixed prices based on estimated fair values or to sell the assets 
if we elect to sell  we receive proceeds up to fixed amounts specified in the agreements 
if the proceeds are less than the specified fixed amounts  we are obligated under a guarantee to pay supplemental rent for the deficiency in proceeds 
the operating leases expire through there are no recourse provisions or collateral that would enable us to recover any amounts paid under this guarantee 
we have issued a guarantee to a financial institution for million related to the debt of our joint ventures in argentina  which are our unconsolidated affiliates 
the term of the guarantee is equal to the term of the related financing  which matures in six years 
there are no recourse provisions or collateral that would enable us to recover any amounts paid under this guarantee 
we have issued guarantees to a financial institution in brazil related to amounts owed to the institution by certain of our customers 
the terms of the guarantees are equal to the terms of the related financing arrangements  which can be as short as days or as long as days 
in the event that the customers default on their payments to the institutions and we would be required to perform under the guarantees  we have obtained collateral from the customers 
at december   the majority of these financing arrangements were collateralized by land and crop production 
we have recorded a liability of million related to the fair value of the above guarantees at december  we have issued parent level guarantees for the repayment of certain of our us senior debt and committed credit facilities with a carrying amount of  million at december  all outstanding debt related to these guarantees is included in the consolidated balance sheet at december  there are no significant restrictions on the ability of bunge limited finance corp 
or any of our other subsidiaries to transfer funds to us 
in addition  certain of our subsidiaries have provided guarantees of indebtedness of certain of their subsidiaries under lines of credit with various institutions 
the total borrowing capacity available under these lines of credit guarantees is million 
capital expenditures our capital expenditures were million in  million in and million in in  major projects included expansion of our edible oil products facilities in europe  the construction of a new margarine plant and an oilseed processing plant in brazil  logistics investments  primarily in brazil  expansion of our grain origination facilities in brazil and expansion of our fertilizer mixing capacity 
in addition  we expanded our indian operations through the buyout of a joint venture partner in india and the purchase of a small crushing and refining facility 
in  we completed the upgrades to several of our oilseed processing and corn dry milling facilities in brazil and the united states and the modernization of an acidulation plant for fertilizers in brazil 
in  we completed a number of revenue enhancing projects which we began in  including constructing a sulfuric acid plant in brazil for our fertilizer segment  as well as the completion of additional agricultural commodities storage facilities in north america and brazil and the upgrade of our destrehan  louisiana export elevator 
also in  we completed the expansion of our oilseed processing plant in rondonopolis  brazil  which is the largest oilseed processing plant in brazil 
although we have no specific material commitments for capital expenditures  we intend to invest approximately million to million in the majority will be used to improve oilseed processing logistics and operating efficiencies in europe  expand and upgrade our mining and port facilities in brazil  expand or acquire grain origination facilities in the united states and europe  modernize certain of our edible oil refineries in the united states and europe and pursue strategic equity investments 
we intend to fund these capital expenditures with cash flows from operations and available borrowings 
cash flows compared to in  our cash balance increased million  reflecting the net impact of cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities  compared to a million increase in our cash balance in our operating activities used cash of million in  compared to cash generated of million in historically  our cash flow from operations has varied depending on the timing of the acquisition of  and the market prices for  agribusiness commodity inventories 
through the third quarter of  our cash flows provided by operations were million 
however  the increase in soy commodity market prices in the latter half of december resulted in significant farmer selling  which increased our use of cash that was needed to acquire inventories 
our risk management policies include hedging strategies to mitigate the risks that the cost of these inventories would not be recovered 
we anticipate generating significant positive cash flows when these inventories are sold 
also reflected in the cash flow from operations is the million paid in in connection with the settlement agreement relating to the sale of ducros by cereol 
see item legal proceedings for additional information on this settlement agreement 
cash generated by investing activities was million for  compared to cash used of  million in investments in property  plant and equipment of million consisted primarily of additions under our normal capital expenditure plan 
of this amount  million represented maintenance capital expenditures in  compared to million in maintenance capital expenditures are expenditures made to replace existing equipment in order to maintain current production capacity 
the majority of non maintenance capital expenditures in related to efficiency improvements to reduce costs  equipment upgrades and business expansion 
the increase in capital expenditures in over is primarily due to the acquisition of cereol as we now have more equipment and facilities 
although we have no current material commitments for capital expenditures  we estimate that our total capital expenditures will be approximately million to million in each of and  including million to million of maintenance capital expenditures 
in  we received net proceeds of million from the sale of our brazilian soy ingredients business  lesieur and our us bakery operations 
we used million to acquire the remaining of cereol s outstanding shares that we did not already own and we paid an additional purchase price of million to edison and cereol s former public shareholders 
in addition  in  we acquired additional shares in fosfertil for million  and we completed certain smaller acquisitions in india and eastern europe having an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
in  we used cash of million net of cash acquired to acquire cereol and million to acquire shares held by minority shareholders in connection with the corporate restructuring of our brazilian subsidiaries and to acquire la plata cereal in argentina 
cash used in financing activities was million in  compared to cash generated of  million in in  we used cash flow from the net proceeds from the sales of businesses to reduce borrowings on short and long term debt 
in  we issued million of senior notes  and  in  we issued million of senior notes and million of convertible notes 
in  mutual investment limited repaid in full the million note owed to us 
dividends paid during were million and million in in  we generated cash by selling common shares for net proceeds of million 
compared to in  we generated cash of million  which was the net effect of cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities  compared to  when we used cash of million 
our operating activities provided cash of million in compared to million in the decrease resulted from the consolidation of cereol s cash flow from operations for the fourth quarter of we did not have the benefit of a full year of cash flow from cereol as it was acquired in october cereol s seasonal acquisition of commodity inventories in the fourth quarter normally causes negative cash flow in the fourth quarter 
excluding the negative effect of cereol s cash flow used by operating activities for the fourth quarter of of million  cash flow from operating activities provided million for  an increase of million compared to cash used in investing activities increased to  million in from million used in investing activities consist primarily of payments for business acquisitions and additions to property  plant and equipment under our capital expenditure plan 
payments for business acquisitions were significantly higher in due to the acquisition of cereol and the acquisition of shares held by minority shareholders in connection with the corporate restructuring of our brazilian subsidiaries 
in  we received net proceeds of million from the sale of our baked goods division 
total capital expenditures for were million 
of this amount  approximately million represented maintenance capital expenditures 
the majority of non maintenance capital expenditures incurred in related to efficiency improvements to reduce costs  equipment upgrades due to changes in technology and business expansion 
cash provided by financing activities increased to  million in from million used in in the first quarter of  we sold common shares for net proceeds of million 
as part of our continuing strategy of centralizing our financing activities at the parent company level  we paid down million of long term variable rate revolving loans held by some of our subsidiaries  which were partially replaced with parent company borrowings 
we also paid the last installment of million on a note collateralized by our commodity exports 
in addition  we borrowed million under our long term credit facilities 
in  we issued senior guaranteed notes  senior notes and convertible notes for aggregate net proceeds of million

recent accounting pronouncements in march  the financial accounting standards board fasb emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on eitf issue no 
issue no 
 whether mineral rights are tangible or intangible assets  that mineral rights  as defined in issue no 
 are tangible assets 
there is an inconsistency between this consensus that mineral rights are tangible assets and the characterization of mineral rights as intangible assets in statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
and no 
in april  the fasb issued proposed staff position fsp no 
fas a and a  interaction of fasb  statements no 
 business combinations and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets and eitf issue no 
 whether mineral rights are tangible or intangible assets to eliminate the inconsistency between eitf issue no 
and sfas no 
and no 
the guidance in this fsp would be effective for the first reporting period beginning after the date that this fsp is finalized 
early application of this guidance is permitted in periods for which financial statements have not yet been issued 
we have applied the eitf and the proposed fsp to our consolidated balance sheet at december  and have reclassified the prior period s consolidated balance sheet to conform to this presentation 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued revised sfas no 
 employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefit sfas no 

this revision of sfas no 
does not change the measurement or recognition of postretirement benefit plans required by sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  pension plans and termination benefits  and sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
this statement retains the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
 which it replaces 
it requires additional disclosures to those in the original sfas no 
about plan assets  investment strategy  measurement dates  plan obligations  cash flows of defined benefit pension plans and other defined benefit postretirement plans

 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity sfas no 

sfas no 
establishes standards for how a company classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
requires that a company classify a financial instrument  which is within the scope of sfas no 
 as a liability or an asset in some circumstances 
sfas no 
is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and to certain other instruments that existed prior to may  as of the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 

sfas no 
amends and clarifies accounting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities under sfas no 
sfas no 
is applied prospectively and is effective for contracts entered into or modified after june   except for sfas no 
implementation issues that have been effective for fiscal quarters that began prior to june   and certain provisions relating to forward purchases or sales of when issued securities or other securities that do not yet exist 
the adoption of sfas no

 revised fin r 
fin as originally issued and as revised by finr  establishes consolidation criteria for entities for which control is not easily discernable under arb the adoption of fin and fin r in did not have a material impact on the accounting for our accounts receivable securitizations or our consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements we have two accounts receivable securitization facilities 
through agreements with certain financial institutions  we may sell  on a revolving basis  undivided percentage ownership interests in designated pools of accounts receivable without recourse up to a maximum amount of million 
collections reduce accounts receivable included in the pools  and are used to purchase new receivables  which become part of the pools 
the facilities expire in and and the effective yield rates approximate the day commercial paper rate plus annual commitment fees ranging from to basis points 
in  the outstanding undivided interests averaged million 
we retain collection and administrative responsibilities for the receivables in the pools 
in  we recognized million in related charges  which are included in selling  general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of income 
in addition  we retain interests in the pools of receivables not sold 
due to the short term nature of the receivables  our retained interests in the pools are valued at historical cost  which approximate fair value 
the full amount of the allowance for doubtful accounts has been retained in our consolidated balance sheets since collections of all pooled receivables are first used to reduce the outstanding undivided interests 
accounts receivable at december  were net of million  representing the outstanding undivided interests in pooled receivables 
other than the receivables securitization facilities and our sale leaseback transactions relating to certain barges and rail cars  we do not have any off balance sheet financings 
tabular disclosure of contractual obligations the following table summarizes our scheduled contractual obligations and their expected maturities at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in the future periods indicated 
at december  contractual obligations total less than year years years after years us in millions commercial paper borrowings other short term borrowings long term debt   non cancelable lease obligations inventory purchase commitments total contractual obligations    we have a joint venture with the european bank for reconstruction and development  or the ebrd  pursuant to which we own approximately and the ebrd owns approximately of polska oil investment bv  or polska oil 
polska oil  in turn  owns of zaklady thuszczowe kruszwica sa  or kruszwica  a polish producer of bottled edible oils 
bunge also has a additional direct interest in kruszwica 
polska oil and kruszwica are our consolidated subsidiaries 
the ebrd has the option to put its shares in polska oil to us at any time prior to june  at the then current fair market value as determined by an independent expert  subject to a floor and cap based on a contractual formula 
at december   the estimated fair market value of the ebrd stake in polska oil was approximately million 
we expect to contribute million to our pension plans and million to our postretirement benefit plans in in addition  in  bunge expects to contribute million to a non qualified plan for a lump sum distribution from that plan 
in connection with the cereol acquisition  we have accrued termination benefits and facility related realignment obligations as part of acquisition integration plan 
these obligations  which totaled million  have been accrued as part of the cereol acquisition purchase price 
through december   million has been paid  with the remaining million expected to be paid during and financed with operating cash flows 
risk factors our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of the risks and uncertainties described below 
additional risks not presently known to us  or that we currently deem immaterial  may also impair our financial condition and business operations 
risks relating to our business and industries the availability and demand for the agricultural commodities and agricultural commodity products that we use and sell in our business can be affected by weather  disease and other factors beyond our control 
weather conditions have historically caused volatility in the agricultural commodities industry and consequently in our operating results by causing crop failures or significantly reduced harvests  which can affect the supply and pricing of the agricultural commodities that we sell and use in our business  reduce the demand for our fertilizer products and negatively affect the creditworthiness of our customers and suppliers 
reduced supply of agricultural commodities due to weather related factors could adversely affect our profitability in the future 
in addition  our operating results can be influenced by sudden shifts in demand for our primary products 
for example  in late and early  a number of asian countries reported outbreaks of a severe form of avian influenza in chickens and ducks that could be contracted by humans 
avian influenza  or bird flu  is a contagious viral disease that normally infects birds and  less commonly  pigs 
this outbreak necessitated the large scale slaughter of poultry flocks in asia and has had a negative impact on our sales of soybean meal to asia 
should a severe form of avian influenza become widespread in other regions  our sales of soybean meal could be further adversely affected 
we are vulnerable to cyclicality in the oilseed processing industry and increases in raw material prices 
in the oilseed processing industry  the lead time required to build an oilseed processing plant can make it difficult to time capacity additions with market demand for oilseed products such as soybean meal and oil 
when additional processing capacity becomes operational  a temporary imbalance between the supply and demand for oilseed processing capacity might exist  which until it is corrected  negatively impacts oilseed processing margins 
oilseed processing margins will continue to fluctuate following industry cycles  which could negatively impact our profitability 
our food products and fertilizer divisions may also be adversely affected by increases in the price of agricultural commodities and fertilizer raw materials that are caused by market fluctuations outside of our control 
historically  in our fertilizer division  products have been priced to import parity  which has minimized the impact of these increases 
however  because of competitive conditions in our industries  we may not be able to recoup any increases in the cost of raw materials through increases in sales prices for our products  which would adversely affect our profitability 
we are subject to economic and political instability and other risks of doing business in emerging markets 
we are a global business with substantial assets located outside of the united states from which we derive a significant portion of our revenue 
our operations in south america and europe are a fundamental part of our business 
in addition  a key part of our strategy involves expanding our business in several emerging markets  including eastern europe  india and china 
volatile economic  political and market conditions in these and other emerging market countries may have a negative impact on our operating results and our ability to achieve our business strategies 
we are exposed to currency exchange rate fluctuations because a portion of our net sales and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
our financial performance may be negatively or positively affected by currency fluctuations 
for example  changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and other currencies  particularly the brazilian real  the argentine peso and the euro  affect our expenses that are denominated in local currencies and may have a negative impact on the value of our assets located outside of the united states 
we are also exposed to other risks of international operations  including increased governmental ownership  including through expropriation  and regulation of the economy in the markets where we operate  inflation and adverse economic conditions resulting from governmental attempts to reduce inflation  such as imposition of higher interest rates and wage and price controls  trade barriers on imports or exports  such as higher tariffs and taxes on imports of agricultural commodities and commodity products  changes in the tax laws or inconsistent tax regulations in the countries where we operate  exchange controls or other currency restrictions  and civil unrest or significant political instability 
the occurrence of any of these events in the markets where we operate or in other markets where we plan to expand or develop our business could jeopardize or limit our ability to transact business in those markets and could adversely affect our revenues and operating results 
government policies and regulations affecting the agricultural sector and related industries could adversely affect our operations and profitability 
agricultural production and trade flows are significantly affected by government policies and regulations 
governmental policies affecting the agricultural industry  such as taxes  tariffs  duties  subsidies and import and export restrictions on agricultural commodities and commodity products  can influence industry profitability  the planting of certain crops versus other uses of agricultural resources  the location and size of crop production  whether unprocessed or processed commodity products are traded and the volume and types of imports and exports 
future government policies may adversely affect the supply  demand for and prices of our products  restrict our ability to do business in our existing and target markets and could cause our financial results to suffer 
we are dependent on access to external sources of financing to acquire and maintain the inventory  facilities and equipment necessary to run our business 
we require significant amounts of capital to operate our business and fund capital expenditures 
we require significant working capital to purchase  process and market our agricultural commodities inventories 
an interruption of our access to short term credit or a significant increase in our cost of credit could materially increase our interest expense and impair our ability to compete effectively in our business 
we operate an extensive network of storage facilities  processing plants  refineries  mills  mines  ports  transportation assets and other facilities as part of our business 
we are required to make substantial capital expenditures to maintain  upgrade and expand these facilities to keep pace with competitive developments  technological advances and changing safety standards in our industry 
significant unbudgeted increases in our capital expenditures could adversely affect our operating results 
in addition  if we are unable to continue devoting substantial resources to maintaining and enhancing our infrastructure  we may not be able to compete effectively 
our future funding requirements will depend  in large part  on our working capital requirements and the nature of our capital expenditures 
in addition  the expansion of our business and pursuit of business opportunities may require us to have access to significant amounts of capital 
as of december   we had approximately billion in total indebtedness 
our indebtedness could limit our ability to obtain additional financing  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in the markets in which we compete  place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that are less leveraged than we are and require us to dedicate more cash on a relative basis to servicing our debt and less to developing our business 
this may limit our ability to run our business and use our resources in the manner in which we would like 
our risk management strategy may not be effective 
our business is affected by fluctuations in agricultural commodities prices and in foreign currency exchange rates 
we engage in hedging transactions to manage these risks 
however  our hedging strategy may not be successful in minimizing our exposure to these fluctuations 
in addition  our control procedures and risk management policies may not successfully prevent our traders from entering into unauthorized transactions that have the potential to impair our financial position 
see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
the expansion of our business through acquisitions and strategic alliances poses risks that may reduce the benefits we anticipate from these transactions 
we have been an active acquirer of other companies  and we have strategic alliances with several partners 
part of our strategy involves acquisitions and alliances designed to expand and enhance our business 
our ability to benefit from acquisitions and alliances depends on many factors  including our ability to identify acquisition or alliance prospects  access capital markets at an acceptable cost of capital  negotiate favorable transaction terms and successfully integrate any businesses we acquire 
integrating businesses we acquire into our operational framework may involve unanticipated delays  costs and other operational problems 
if we encounter unexpected problems with one of our acquisitions or alliances  our senior management may be required to divert attention away from other aspects of our businesses to address these problems 
acquisitions also pose the risk that we may be exposed to successor liability relating to actions by an acquired company and its management before the acquisition 
the due diligence we conduct in connection with an acquisition  and any contractual guarantees or indemnities that we receive from the sellers of acquired companies  may not be sufficient to protect us from  or compensate us for  actual liabilities 
a material liability associated with an acquisition could adversely affect our reputation and results of operations and reduce the benefits of the acquisition 
we could lose customers and incur liability if we fail to properly label or separate products that contain genetically modified organisms from those that do not 
the use of genetically modified organisms gmos in food and animal feed has been met with varying acceptance in the different markets in which we operate 
the united states and argentina have approved the use of gmos in food products and animal feed  and gmo and non gmo grain are frequently commingled during the grain origination process 
however  in some of the markets where we sell our products  most significantly the european union and brazil  government regulations limit sales or require labeling of gmo products 
in brazil  the government legalized the planting and sale of gmo soybeans in certain regions through january however  certain brazilian states have banned the planting  sale or transport of gmo crops  which has resulted in the disruption of certain gmo crop shipments 
in general  we conduct no gmo testing in our us or argentine operations 
historically  we have done only limited gmo testing in brazil 
however  efforts by the monsanto company to collect royalties on its gmo soybeans from farmers in brazil will likely result in increased testing going forward  which could disrupt our operations and increase our operating costs in brazil 
in our us food products division  we are able to test only representative samples of our inventory 
we may inadvertently deliver products that contain gmos to customers that request gmo free products 
as a result  we could lose customers  incur liability and damage our reputation 
we face intense competition in each of our divisions  particularly in our agribusiness and food products divisions 
we face significant competition in each of our divisions  particularly in our agribusiness and food products divisions 
we have numerous competitors  some of which may be larger and have greater financial resources than we have 
in addition  we face significant competitive challenges outlined below 
agribusiness 
the markets for our products are highly price competitive and are sensitive to product substitution 
we compete against large multinational  regional and national suppliers  processors and distributors and farm cooperatives 
our principal competitors are the archer daniels midland co  or adm  and cargill  inc competition with these and other suppliers  processors and distributors is based on price  service offerings and geographic location 
food products 
several of the markets in which our food products division operates  particularly those in which we sell consumer products  are mature and highly competitive 
in addition  consolidation in the supermarket industry has resulted in our retail customers demanding lower prices and reducing the number of suppliers with which they do business 
to compete effectively in our food products division  we must establish and maintain favorable brand recognition  efficiently manage distribution  gain sufficient market share  develop products sought by consumers and other customers  implement appropriate pricing  provide marketing support and obtain access to retail outlets and sufficient shelf space for our retail products 
in addition  sales of our soybean oil products could be subject to increased competition as a result of the recent adverse publicity associated with trans fatty acids 
if our customers switch to products that do not contain trans fatty acids or our competitors are able to offer or develop additional low trans fatty acid products more economically or quickly than we can  our competitive position could suffer and our edible oil segment revenues could be negatively affected 
competition could cause us to lose market share  exit certain lines of business  increase expenditures or reduce pricing  each of which could have an adverse effect on our revenues and profitability 
we are subject to regulation in numerous jurisdictions and may be exposed to liability as a result of our handling of hazardous materials and commodities storage operations 
our business involves the handling and use of hazardous materials 
in addition  the storage and processing of our products may create hazardous conditions 
for example  we use hexane in our oilseed processing operations  and hexane can cause explosions that could harm our employees or damage our facilities 
our agricultural commodities storage operations also create dust that has caused explosions in our grain elevators 
in addition  our mining operations and manufacturing of fertilizers require compliance with environmental regulations 
our operations are regulated by environmental laws and regulations in the countries where we operate  including those governing the labeling  use  storage  discharge and disposal of hazardous materials 
these laws and regulations require us to implement procedures for the handling of hazardous materials and for operating in potentially hazardous conditions  and they impose liability on us for the cleanup of any environmental contamination 
in addition  brazilian law allocates liability for noncompliance with environmental laws by an acquired company to the acquiror for an indefinite period of time 
because we use and handle hazardous substances in our business  changes in environmental requirements or an unanticipated significant adverse environmental event could have a material adverse effect on our business

risks relating to our common shares we are a bermuda company  and it may be difficult for you to enforce judgments against us and our directors and executive officers 
we are a bermuda exempted company 
as a result  the rights of holders of our common shares will be governed by bermuda law and our memorandum of association and bye laws 
the rights of shareholders under bermuda law may differ from the rights of shareholders of companies or corporations incorporated in other jurisdictions 
most of our directors and some of our officers are not residents of the united states  and a substantial portion of our assets and the assets of those directors and officers are located outside the united states 
as a result  it may be difficult for you to effect service of process on those persons in the united states or to enforce in the us judgments obtained in us courts against us or those persons based on civil liability provisions of the us securities laws 
we have been advised by our bermuda counsel  conyers dill pearman  that uncertainty exists as to whether courts in bermuda will enforce judgments obtained in other jurisdictions  including the united states  against us or our directors or officers under the securities laws of those jurisdictions or entertain actions in bermuda against us or our directors or officers under the securities laws of other jurisdictions 
our bye laws restrict shareholders from bringing legal action against our officers and directors 
our bye laws contain a broad waiver by our shareholders of any claim or right of action  both individually and on our behalf  against any of our officers or directors 
the waiver applies to any action taken by an officer or director  or the failure of an officer or director to take any action  in the performance of his or her duties  except with respect to any matter involving any fraud or dishonesty on the part of the officer or director 
this waiver limits the right of shareholders to assert claims against our officers and directors unless the act or failure to act involves fraud or dishonesty 
we have anti takeover provisions in our bye laws and have adopted a shareholder rights plan that may discourage a change of control 
our bye laws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors 
these provisions provide for a classified board of directors with staggered three year terms  directors to be removed without cause only upon the affirmative vote of at least of all votes attaching to all shares then in issue entitling the holder to attend and vote on the resolution  restrictions on the time period in which directors may be nominated  our board of directors to determine the powers  preferences and rights of our preference shares and to issue the preference shares without shareholder approval  and an affirmative vote of of all votes attaching to all shares then in issue entitling the holder to attend and vote on the resolution for some business combination transactions  which have not been approved by our board of directors 
in addition  our board of directors has adopted a shareholder rights plan which will entitle shareholders to purchase our series a preference shares if a third party acquires beneficial ownership of or more of our common shares 
in some circumstances  shareholders are also entitled to purchase the common stock of a company issuing shares in exchange for our common shares in a merger  amalgamation or tender offer or a company acquiring most of our assets 
these provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if the third party s offer may be considered beneficial by many shareholders 
as a result  shareholders may be limited in their ability to obtain a premium for their shares 
we may become a passive foreign investment company  which could result in adverse us tax consequences to us investors 
adverse us federal income tax rules apply to individuals owning shares of a passive foreign investment company  or pfic  directly or indirectly including by holding an option to acquire shares of a pfic  such as a debt security convertible into shares 
we will be classified as a pfic for us federal income tax purposes if or more of our assets  including goodwill based on an annual quarterly average  are passive assets  or or more of our annual gross income is derived from passive assets 
the calculation of goodwill will be based  in part  on the then market value of our common shares  which is subject to change 
based on certain estimates of our gross income and gross assets available as of december  and relying on certain exceptions in the applicable us treasury regulations  we do not believe that we are currently a pfic 
such a characterization could result in adverse us tax consequences to us investors in our common shares and our convertible notes due in particular  absent an election described below  a us investor would be subject to us federal income tax at ordinary income tax rates  plus a possible interest charge  in respect of gain derived from a disposition of our shares  as well as certain distributions by us 
in addition  a step up in the tax basis of our shares would not be available upon the death of an individual shareholder  and the preferential us federal income tax rates applicable to dividend income of certain us investors for periods prior to our being treated as a pfic would not apply 
since pfic status is determined by us on an annual basis and will depend on the composition of our income and assets and the nature of our activities from time to time  we cannot assure you that we will not be considered a pfic for the current or any future taxable year 
if we are treated as a pfic for any taxable year us investors may desire to make an election to treat us as a qualified electing fund with respect to shares owned a qef election  in which case us investors will be required to take into account a pro rata share of our earnings and net capital gain for each year  regardless of whether we make any distributions 
as an alternative to the qef election  a us investor may be able to make an election to mark to market our shares each taxable year and recognize ordinary income pursuant to such election based upon increases in the value of our shares 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management as a result of our global operating and financing activities  we are exposed to changes in agricultural commodity prices  foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates  which may affect our results of operations and financial position 
we use derivative financial instruments for the purpose of managing the risks and or costs associated with fluctuations in commodity prices and foreign exchange rates 
while these hedging instruments are subject to fluctuations in value  those fluctuations are generally offset by the value of the underlying exposures being hedged 
the counterparties to these contractual arrangements are primarily major financial institutions or  in the case of commodity futures and options  a commodity exchange 
as a result  credit risk arising from these contracts is not significant and we do not anticipate any significant losses 
our finance and risk management committee supervises  reviews and periodically revises our overall risk management policies and risk limits 
we only enter into derivatives that are related to our inherent business and financial exposure as a global agribusiness company 
commodities risk we operate in many areas of the food industry from agricultural raw materials to the production and sale of branded food products 
as a result  we use and produce various materials  many of which are agricultural commodities  including soybeans  soybean oil  soybean meal  wheat and corn 
agricultural commodities are subject to price fluctuations due to a number of unpredictable factors that may create price risk 
we enter into various derivative contracts  primarily exchange traded futures and options  with the objective of managing our exposure to adverse price movements in the agricultural commodities used for our business operations 
we have established policies that limit the amount of unhedged fixed price agricultural commodity positions permissible for our operating companies  which are a combination of quantity and value at risk limits 
we measure and review our sensitivity to our net commodities position on a daily basis 
we use a sensitivity analysis to estimate our daily exposure to market risk on our agricultural commodity position 
the daily net agricultural commodity position consists of inventory  related purchase and sale contracts  and exchange traded contracts  including those used to hedge portions of our production requirements 
the fair value of that position is a summation of the fair values calculated for each agricultural commodity by valuing each net position at quoted average futures prices for the period 
market risk is estimated as the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in prices 
the results of this analysis  which may differ from actual results  are as follows year ended december  year ended december  us in millions fair value market risk fair value market risk highest net long position highest net short position currency risk our global operations require active participation in foreign exchange markets 
to reduce the risk of foreign exchange rate fluctuations  we follow a policy of hedging net monetary assets and liabilities and transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies applicable to each of our various subsidiaries 
our primary exposure is related to our businesses located in brazil and argentina and to a lesser extent  europe and asia 
to minimize the adverse impact of currency movements  we enter into foreign exchange swaps and option contracts to hedge currency exposures 
when determining our exposure  we exclude intercompany loans that are deemed to be permanently invested 
the repayments of permanently invested intercompany loans are not planned or anticipated in the foreseeable future and therefore are treated as analogous to equity for accounting purposes 
as a result  the foreign exchange gains and losses on these borrowings are excluded from the determination of net income and recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
the balance of permanently invested intercompany borrowings was million and million as of december  and december   respectively 
included in other comprehensive income loss are exchange gains of million in and exchange losses of million in  related to permanently invested intercompany loans 
for risk management purposes and to determine the overall level of hedging required  we further reduce the foreign exchange exposure determined above by the value of our agricultural commodities inventories 
our agricultural commodities inventories  because of their international pricing in us dollars  provide a natural hedge to our currency exposure 
our net currency position  including cross currency swaps and currency options  and our market risk  which is the potential loss from an adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates  is set forth in the following table 
in addition  we have provided an analysis of our foreign currency exposure after reducing the exposure for our agricultural commodities inventory 
actual results may differ from the information set forth below 
us in millions as of december  as of december  brazilian operations net currency short position  from financial instruments  including derivatives  market risk agricultural commodities inventories  net currency long short position  less agricultural commodities inventories market risk argentine operations net currency long short position  from financial instruments  including derivatives market risk agricultural commodities inventories net currency long position  less agricultural commodities inventories market risk interest rate risk we issue debt in fixed and floating rate instruments 
we are exposed to market risk due to changes in interest rates 
we do not engage in interest rate related financial transactions for trading or speculative purposes 
we did not have any outstanding interest rate swaps at december  of our total long term debt outstanding of  million at december  including current maturities   million was fixed rate 
long term debt that is exposed to interest rate risk at december  is listed below 
us in millions as of december  payable in us dollars long term debt  variable interest rates indexed to libor plus to payable in brazilian reais bndes loans  variable interest rate indexed to igpm plus other total variable rate long term debt  including current maturities libor as of december  was 
bndes loans are brazilian government industrial development loans 
igpm is a brazilian inflation index published by funda o getulio vargas 
the annualized rate for the year ended december  was an increase in the interest rates on our long term variable rate debt based on a change in the libor and igpm rates at december  would increase the interest rates on our variable rate debt between to basis points  which would have no material effect on our operating results 
in addition to long term debt  we have variable interest rate short term debt and commercial paper with a balance of million at december  the short term debt is predominantly held with commercial banks and the interest rates are generally based on libor plus a spread of to 
our commercial paper is rated a by standard poor s rating services and p by moody s investors service  inc and the interest rates on our commercial paper borrowings are indexed to this rating 
an increase in interest rates on our short term debt based on a change in libor and a change in the commercial paper interest rate for a p rated commercial paper at december  would increase the interest rate on our variable rate short term debt approximately basis points  which would have no material effect on our operating results
