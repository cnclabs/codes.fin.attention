item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
we are a leading national distributor of natural and organic foods and related products in the united states 
in recent years  our sales to existing and new customers have increased through the continued growth of the natural products industry in general  the acquisition of or merger with natural products distributors and the expansion of our existing distribution centers 
through these efforts  we believe that we have been able to broaden our geographic penetration  expand our customer base  enhance and diversify our product selections and increase our market share 
through our subsidiary  the natural retail group  inc  we also own and operate retail natural products stores located primarily in florida 
we believe that our retail business serves as a natural complement to our distribution business because it enables us to develop new marketing programs and improve customer service 
in addition  our subsidiary  hershey imports company  inc hershey  specializes in the international trading  roasting and packaging of nuts  seeds  dried fruits and snack items 
our operations are comprised of three principal divisions our wholesale division  which includes our eastern region  western region and albert s  our retail division  which consists of our retail stores  and our manufacturing division  which is comprised of hershey 
in order to maintain our market leadership and improve our operating efficiencies  we are continually increasing our investment in our people  facilities  equipment and technology  expanding marketing and customer service programs across our regions  expanding national purchasing opportunities  consolidating systems applications among physical locations and regions  integrating administrative and accounting functions  and reducing geographic overlap between regions 
in addition  our continued growth has created the need for expansion of existing facilities in order to achieve maximum operating efficiencies and to ensure that we possess adequate space for future needs 
we completed the expansions of our dayville  connecticut and iowa city  iowa distribution facilities in july as a result of these expansions  we now operate a  square foot facility in iowa city  iowa and a  square foot facility in dayville  connecticut 
these expansions will allow us to increase our product diversity and to better serve customers in the midwest and northeast markets of our eastern region  while eliminating outside storage expenses 
we expect the efficiencies created by expanding our iowa city and dayville facilities will take approximately nine months to fully manifest themselves in the form of lower expenses relative to sales 
we have made considerable capital expenditures and incurred considerable expenses in connection with the expansion of our facilities  including the expansion of our facilities located in auburn  california  chesterfield  new hampshire  new oxford  pennsylvania and vernon  california  the expansion and relocation of our facility in atlanta  georgia  and the addition of our fontana  california distribution facility 
having completed the iowa city and dayville facilities expansion  we have now added approximately  square feet to our distribution centers in the last years  which represents a increase in our distribution capacity 
our net sales consist primarily of sales of natural products to retailers adjusted for customer volume discounts  returns and allowances 
the principal components of our cost of sales include the amount paid to manufacturers and growers for product sold  plus the cost of transportation necessary to bring the product to our distribution facilities 
operating expenses include salaries and wages  employee benefits including payments under our employee stock ownership plan  warehousing and delivery  selling  occupancy  insurance  administrative  depreciation and amortization expense 
other expenses income include interest on outstanding indebtedness  interest income  and the change in fair value of financial instruments and miscellaneous income and expenses 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the us securities and exchange commission has defined critical accounting policies as those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require our most difficult  complex or subjective judgments or estimates 
based on this definition  we believe our critical accounting policies include the following i determining our allowance for doubtful accounts  ii determining our reserve for the self insured portion of our workers compensation  health insurance and automobile liabilities and iii valuing goodwill and intangible assets 
for all financial statement periods presented  there have been no material modifications to the application of these critical accounting policies 
allowance for doubtful accounts we analyze customer creditworthiness  accounts receivable balances  payment history  payment terms and historical bad debt levels when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts 
in instances where a reserve has been recorded for a particular customer  future sales to the customer are conducted using either cash on delivery terms  or the account is closely monitored so that as agreed upon payments are received  orders are released  a failure to pay results in held or cancelled orders 
our accounts receivable balance was million and million  net of the allowance for doubtful accounts of million and million  as of july  and  respectively 
our notes receivable balances were million and million  net of the allowance of doubtful accounts of million and million  as of july  and  respectively 
insurance reserves it is our policy to record the self insured portion of our workers compensation  health insurance and automobile liabilities based upon actuarial estimates of the future cost of claims and related expenses that have been reported but not settled  and that have been incurred but not yet reported 
any projection of losses concerning workers compensation and automobile liability is subject to a considerable degree of variability 
among the causes of this variability are unpredictable external factors affecting litigation trends  benefit level changes and claim settlement patterns 
if actual claims incurred are greater than those anticipated  our reserves may be insufficient and additional costs could be recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
valuation of goodwill and intangible assets sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets requires that companies no longer amortize goodwill  but instead test goodwill for impairment at least annually and between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
we have elected to perform our annual tests for indications of goodwill impairment as of july of each year 
impairment losses are determined based upon the excess of carrying amounts over discounted expected future cash flows of the underlying business 
the assessment of the recoverability of long lived assets will be impacted if estimated future cash flows are not achieved 
for reporting units that indicated potential impairment  we determined the implied fair value of that reporting unit using a discounted cash flow analysis and compared such values to the respective reporting units carrying amounts 
as of july   our annual assessment of each of our reporting units indicated that no impairment of goodwill existed 
total goodwill as of july  and was million and million  respectively 
results of operations the following table presents  for the periods indicated  certain income and expense items expressed as a percentage of net sales year ended july  gaap basis excluding special items net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses restructuring and asset impairment charges amortization of intangibles total operating expenses operating income other expense income interest expense change in value of financial instruments other  net total other expense income before income taxes income taxes net income total reflects rounding year ended july  compared to year ended july  net sales our net sales increased approximately  or million  to billion for the year ended july  from billion for the year ended july  this increase was due to our organic growth and the implementation of our primary distribution agreement with wild oats markets  inc wild oats markets during the third quarter of fiscal growth in the independently owned natural products retailers and mass market distribution channels was approximately and  respectively  compared to the same period in the prior year 
growth in the supernaturals distribution channel was approximately compared to the same period in the prior year 
fiscal sales growth excluding the effect of sales to wild oats markets was 
sales to our largest customer  whole foods market represented approximately of net sales for the year ended july  whole foods market represented approximately of net sales for the year ended july  our current distribution arrangement with whole foods market was extended through december  on july  we are currently in discussions with whole foods market to continue our relationship upon expiration of the existing agreement 
gross profit our gross profit increased approximately  or million  to million for the year ended july  from million for the year ended july  our gross profit as a percentage of net sales was and for the years ended july  and  respectively 
this decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily the result of the change in our sales mix to supernaturals  as we implemented our primary distribution agreement with wild oats markets during the second half of fiscal operating expenses our total operating expenses  excluding special items  increased approximately  or million  to million for the year ended july  from million for the year ended july  our total operating expenses  including special items  increased approximately  or million  to million for the year ended july  from million for the year ended july  as a percentage of net sales  operating expenses  excluding special items  decreased to for the year ended july  from for the year ended july  as a percentage of net sales  operating expenses  including special items  decreased from for the year ended july  to for the year ended july  special items are discussed below 
the increase in operating expenses was due primarily to an increase in our infrastructure to support our continued growth 
operating expenses for the year ended july  included million in special items related to start up and transition costs for certain equipment rental and labor costs incurred in connection with the implementation of our primary distribution agreement with wild oats markets 
the primary drivers of the increase in operating expenses were compensation and benefit expenses due to the increase in headcount 
transportation  fuel expense and utilities costs continued to be incurred at levels consistent with the prior year as a percentage of sales 
operating expenses for the year ended july  included special items of million related to a goodwill impairment charge to our hershey subsidiary  million in costs incurred related to the expansion of our chesterfield  new hampshire distribution center  million in restructuring and asset impairment charges and million in costs related to the loss of a major customer 
we may incur additional special items as we increase our warehouse capacity 
operating income operating income  excluding the special items discussed below  increased approximately  or million  to million for the year ended july  from million for the year ended july  as a percentage of sales  operating income  excluding special items  increased to for the year ended july  compared to for the year ended july  operating income  including special items  increased approximately  or million  to million  or of sales  for the year ended july  from million  or of sales  for the year ended july  other expense income other expense income  excluding the change in fair value of financial instruments  decreased million to million for the year ended july  from million for the year ended july  this decrease was the result of a million decrease in interest expense partially offset by a million decrease in other income 
the decrease in interest expense was due to the novation of two of our interest rate swap agreements in december  which served to lower our effective interest rate  partially offset by higher debt levels in fiscal as a result of our acquisitions of blooming prairie and northeast cooperative in fiscal and an increase in inventory levels to support the growth in our business 
other expense income  including the change in fair value of financial instruments  decreased or million to million for the year ended july  from million for the year ended july  this decrease was primarily due to the decrease in the change in the fair value on our interest rate swap agreements and related option agreements 
on december   we assigned and transferred all of our obligations of our two ineffective interest rate swaps to a third party at a cost of million plus accrued interest 
as a result of this assignment  these ineffective swaps will no longer be included as a special item for future fiscal periods 
these ineffective swaps were included as a special item through the second quarter of fiscal income taxes our effective income tax rate was and for the years ended july  and  respectively 
the effective rates were higher than the federal statutory rate primarily due to state and local income taxes 
net income as a result of the foregoing  net income  excluding special items  increased approximately  or million  to million  or per diluted share  for the year ended july   compared to million  or per diluted share  for the year ended july  net income  including special items  increased approximately  or million  to million  or per diluted share  for the year ended july  compared to million  or per diluted share  for the year ended july  we expect earnings per diluted share in the range of to for fiscal  excluding any potential special items 
special items special items for the year ended july  included i the start up and transition costs of the new wild oats markets primary distributorship consisting of certain equipment rental and labor costs and ii the non cash items from the change in fair value on interest rate swap agreements which were caused by favorable changes in interest rate yield curves 
special items for the year ended july  included i a goodwill impairment charge  inventory write down and restructuring and asset impairment charges related to our subsidiary  hershey  ii moving and other costs related to the expansion of our chesterfield  new hampshire distribution facility  iii costs related to the loss of a major customer and iv a non cash charge related to the change in the fair value of interest rate swaps and related option agreements caused by unfavorable changes in yield curves 
on december   we assigned and transferred all of our obligations of our two ineffective interest rate swaps to a third party at a cost of million plus accrued interest 
as a result of this novation  these ineffective swaps will no longer be included as a special item for future fiscal periods 
these ineffective swaps were included as a special item through the second quarter of fiscal we entered into interest rate swap agreements in october  august and may the october and august agreements were ineffective hedges as a result of the options held by the counter parties that could have extended the original term of the interest rate swap agreements 
applicable accounting treatment required that we record the changes in fair value of the october and august agreements in our consolidated statement of income  rather than within other comprehensive income in our statement of stockholders equity 
the changes in fair value were dependent upon the forward looking yield curves for each swap 
the may agreement is an effective hedge and therefore does not require this treatment 
we believe that our october and august agreements are special items that are excludable as non recurring items 
first  we only intend to enter into effective hedges going forward 
this stated intention began with the may agreement 
second  we believe that the october and august agreements may distort and confuse investors if the change in fair value cannot be treated as a special item because their inclusion directly impacts our reported earnings per share 
a change in fair value  whether positive or negative  can significantly increase or decrease our reported earnings per share 
for example  we recorded a positive change in fair value for fiscal that increased our diluted earnings per share by  and in fiscal we recorded a negative change in fair value that decreased our diluted earnings per share by 
if we were prohibited from excluding this item as a special item  it would artificially inflate decrease our reported earnings per share and thereby mislead investors as to our results of operations and our financial condition

year ended july  compared to year ended july  net sales our net sales increased approximately  or million  to billion for the year ended july  from billion for the year ended july  the increase was primarily due to the effects of the acquired businesses  resulting in growth in the independently owned natural products retailers and mass market distribution channels of approximately and  respectively 
we acquired blooming prairie  a distributor of natural foods and products in the midwest region of the united states  in october  and northeast cooperative  another natural food distributor  in december the decline in the percentage of sales to supernaturals over the prior year was the result of the expiration of our contract as primary distributor to wild oats markets in august however  we continued to distribute to wild oats markets in fiscal as a secondary supplier  and generated revenue from such distribution of approximately million 
fiscal sales growth including acquisitions  but excluding the effect of sales to wild oats  was 
sales to our largest customer  whole foods market represented approximately of net sales for the year ended july  whole foods market and wild oats markets represented approximately and  respectively  of net sales for the year ended july  gross profit our gross profit increased approximately  or million  to million for the year ended july  from million for the year ended july  our gross profit as a percentage of net sales was and for the years ended july  and  respectively 
operating expenses our total operating expenses  excluding special items  increased approximately  or million  to million for the year ended july  from million for the year ended july  our total operating expenses  including special items  increased approximately  or million  to million for the year ended july  from million for the year ended july  as a percentage of net sales  operating expenses  excluding special items  increased to for the year ended july  from for the year ended july  as a percentage of net sales  operating expenses  including special items  increased from for the year ended july  to for the year ended july  special items are discussed below 
the increase in operating expenses was due primarily to the effect of the acquired businesses and lower productivity caused by the transition of the wild oats markets business 
transportation  warehouse labor  and utilities costs continued to be incurred at levels consistent with the prior year as a percentage of sales 
fuel expense  as a percentage of sales  increased approximately basis points compared to the prior year  due primarily to the marked increase in average diesel prices during the year 
the operating expense figures reflect the impact of the adoption of the financial accounting standards board s emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor  which requires the reclassification of advertising income to cost of goods sold from operating expenses 
these changes reduced cost of sales and also increased operating expenses by million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
this accounting change had no impact on reported operating income  net income or earnings per share 
operating income operating income  excluding the special items discussed below  increased approximately  or million  to million for the year ended july  from million for the year ended july  as a percentage of sales  operating income  excluding special items  decreased to for the year ended july  compared to for the year ended july  operating income  including special items  increased approximately  or million  to million  or of sales  for the year ended july  from million  or of sales  for the year ended july  other income expense other expense  excluding the change in fair value of financial instruments  remained relatively flat at million for the years ended july  and this consistency was primarily due to higher interest expense caused by a higher borrowing base  which was partially offset by lower interest rates and an increase in other income of million 
other expense  including the change in fair value of financial instruments  decreased million to million for the year ended july  from million for the year ended july  this decrease was primarily due to a smaller decline in the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements and related option agreements resulting from unfavorable changes in yield curves used to determine the change in fair value 
income taxes our effective income tax rate was and for the years ended july  and  respectively 
the effective rates were higher than the federal statutory rate primarily due to state and local income taxes 
net income as a result of the foregoing  net income  excluding special items  increased approximately  or million  to million  or per diluted share  for the year ended july   compared to million  or per diluted share  for the year ended july  net income  including special items  increased approximately  or million  to million  or per diluted share  for the year ended july  compared to million  or per diluted share  for the year ended july  special items the special items for the year ended july  included a goodwill impairment charge  inventory write down and restructuring and asset impairment charges related to our subsidiary  hershey  and moving and other costs related to the expansion of our chesterfield  new hampshire distribution facility 
in addition  the special items included costs related to the loss of a major customer and a non cash charge related to the change in the fair value of interest rate swaps and related option agreements caused by unfavorable changes in yield curves 
special items for the year ended july  consisted of a non cash charge related to the change in the fair value of interest rate swaps and related option agreements caused by unfavorable changes in yield curves as well as moving  asset impairment and redundant rent expense related to moving our atlanta  georgia distribution facility  incremental costs such as labor  utilities and rent related to the startup of our southern california distribution facility and labor  utilities  rent and severance related to relocating our subsidiary  hershey

a description of our use of non gaap information is provided under use of non gaap results below 
liquidity and capital resources we finance operations and growth primarily with cash flows from operations  borrowings under our credit facility  operating leases  trade payables  bank indebtedness and the sale of equity and debt securities 
on april   we entered into an amended and restated four year million revolving credit facility with a bank group that was led by bank of america business capital formerly fleet capital corporation as the administrative agent 
the amended and restated credit facility provides for improved terms and conditions that provide us with more financial and operational flexibility  reduced costs and increased liquidity 
the new credit facility replaced an existing million revolving credit facility 
our amended and restated secured revolving credit facility allows for borrowing up to million  on which interest accrues at libor plus 
the million credit facility matures on march  this increased credit facility will support our working capital requirements in the ordinary course of business and provide capital to grow our business organically or through acquisitions 
as of july   our borrowing base  based on accounts receivable and inventory levels  was million  with remaining availability of million 
additionally  in april we executed a term loan agreement in the principal amount of million secured by the real property that was released in accordance with the aforementioned amendment 
in december  we amended this term loan agreement by increasing the principal amount by million to million  under the existing terms and conditions  to fund the expansion of our distribution centers in iowa city  iowa and dayville  connecticut 
the million term loan is repayable over seven years based on a fifteen year amortization schedule 
interest on the term loan accrues at libor plus 
proceeds received from the term loan were used to reduce the outstanding balance on our former million credit facility on which interest accrued at the new york prime rate or libor plus 
we believe that our capital requirements for fiscal will be in the to million range  and that we will finance these requirements with cash generated from operations and the use of our existing credit facilities 
these projects will provide both new facilities and technology that will provide us with the capacity to continue to support the growth and expansion of our customers 
we believe that our future capital requirements will be similar to our anticipated fiscal requirements  as we continue to invest in our growth by upgrading our infrastructure and expanding our facilities 
future investments in acquisitions will be financed through either equity or long term debt negotiated at the time of the potential acquisition 
net cash provided by operations was million for the year ended july  and was the result of our strong operating results and increases in payables  partially offset by investments in inventory and increased receivable levels due to our increased sales 
the increase in inventory levels relates to supporting increased sales with wider product assortment combined with our ability to capture purchasing efficiency opportunities in excess of total carrying costs  as well as the our implementation of our primary distribution agreement with wild oats markets 
days in inventory increased slightly to days at july  compared to days at july  days sales outstanding was days at both july  and net cash provided by operations was million for the year ended july  and was due to cash collected from customers net of cash paid to vendors  partially offset by investments in inventory 
working capital at july  was million 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended july  and was due primarily to the expansion of our dayville  connecticut and iowa city  iowa distribution facilities  compared to million of net cash used for the same period last year that was due primarily to the purchase of substantially all the assets of blooming prairie cooperative  the merger with privately held northeast cooperative  and the expansion of our chesterfield  new hampshire facility 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended july  due to net borrowings under our revolving credit facility  proceeds received from the issuance of long term debt  and proceeds received from the exercise of stock options  partially offset by repayments on long term debt 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended july  due to proceeds from the issuance of a million term loan agreement and proceeds from the exercise of stock options  partially offset by repayments of long term debt and repayments on our million secured revolving credit facility 
in october  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement that provided for us to pay interest for a five year period at a fixed rate of on a notional principal amount of million while receiving interest for the same period at the libor rate on the same notional principal amount 
this swap had been entered into as a hedge against libor interest rate movements on current and anticipated variable rate indebtedness totaling million at libor plus  thereby fixing the effective rate at 
in october  the counter party exercised its option to extend the original five year term of the swap agreement to seven years 
the inclusion of this option prohibited accounting for the swap as an effective hedge under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
we entered into an additional interest rate swap agreement effective august the additional agreement provided for us to pay interest for a four year period at a fixed rate of on a notional principal amount of million while receiving interest for the same period at the libor rate on the same notional principal amount 
the four year term of the swap agreement could have been extended to six years at the option of the counter party  which prohibited accounting for the swap as an effective hedge under sfas the swap had been entered into as a hedge against libor interest rate movements on current and anticipated variable rate indebtedness totaling million at libor plus  thereby fixing the effective rate on the notional amount at 
if libor exceeded in a given period  the agreement was suspended for that period 
on december   we assigned and transferred all of our obligations of our two ineffective interest rate swaps to a third party at a cost of million plus accrued interest 
as a result of this assignment  these ineffective swaps will no longer be included as a special item for future fiscal periods 
these ineffective swaps were included as special items for the first two quarters of fiscal in may  we entered into an additional interest rate swap agreement 
the agreement provides for us to pay interest for a seven year period at a fixed rate of on a notional principal amount of million while receiving interest for the same period at the libor rate on the same notional principal amount 
the swap has been entered into as a hedge against libor interest rate movements on current variable rate indebtedness totaling million at libor plus  thereby fixing our effective rate on the notional amount at 
libor was as of july  the swap agreement qualifies as an effective hedge under sfas no 
commitments and contingencies the following schedule summarizes our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of july  payments due by period total less than one year years years thereafter in thousands notes payable   long term debt      capital lease obligations long term non capitalized leases     total      the notes payable  long term debt and capital lease obligations shown above exclude interest payments due 
in addition  cash to be paid for income taxes is excluded from the table above 
outstanding commitments as of july  for the purchase of inventory were approximately million 
we had outstanding letters of credit of approximately million at july  impact of inflation historically  we have been able to pass along inflation related increases to our customers 
consequently  inflation has not had a material impact upon the results of our operations or profitability 
seasonality generally  we do not experience any material seasonality 
however  our sales and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to factors such as changes in our operating expenses  management s ability to execute our operating and growth strategies  personnel changes  demand for natural products  supply shortages and general economic conditions 
recently issued financial accounting standards we have determined that there are no recently issued accounting standards that are expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
use of non gaap results financial measures included in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations that are not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap are referred to as non gaap financial measures 
to supplement our financial statements presented on a gaap basis  we use non gaap additional measures of operating results  net earnings and earnings per share adjusted to exclude special items 
we believe that the use of these additional measures is appropriate to enhance an overall understanding of our past financial performance and also our prospects for the future as these special items are not expected to be part of our ongoing business 
the adjustments to our gaap results are made with the intent of providing both management and investors with a more complete understanding of the underlying operational results and trends and its marketplace performance 
for example  these adjusted non gaap results are among the primary indicators management uses as a basis for our planning and forecasting of future periods 
the presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net earnings or diluted earnings per share prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
a comparison and reconciliation from non gaap to gaap results is included in the tables above 
certain factors that may affect future results this annual report on form k and the documents incorporated by reference in this annual report on form k contain forward looking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties 
in some cases you can identify these statements by forward looking words such as anticipate  believe  could  estimate  expect  intend  may  should  will  and would  or similar words 
you should read statements that contain these words carefully because they discuss future expectations  contain projections of future results of operations or of financial position or state other forward looking information 
the important factors listed below as well as any cautionary language in this annual report on form k  provide examples of risks  uncertainties and events that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations described in these forward looking statements 
you should be aware that the occurrence of the events described in the risk factors below and elsewhere in this annual report on form k could have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial position 
any forward looking statements in this annual report on form k and the documents incorporated by reference in this annual report on form k are not guarantees of future performance  and actual results  developments and business decisions may differ from those envisaged by such forward looking statements  possibly materially 
we do not undertake to update any information in the foregoing reports until the effective date of our future reports required by applicable laws 
any projections of future results of operations should not be construed in any manner as a guarantee that such results will in fact occur 
these projections are subject to change and could differ materially from final reported results 
we may from time to time update these publicly announced projections  but we are not obligated to do so 
acquisitions we continually evaluate opportunities to acquire other companies 
we believe that there are risks related to acquiring companies including overpaying for acquisitions  losing key employees of acquired companies and failing to achieve potential synergies 
additionally  our business could be adversely affected if we are unable to integrate our acquisitions and mergers 
a significant portion of our historical growth has been achieved through acquisitions of or mergers with other distributors of natural products 
successful integration of mergers is critical to our future operating and financial performance 
integration requires  among other things maintaining the customer base  the optimization of delivery routes  coordination of administrative  distribution and finance functions  and the integration of management information systems and personnel 
the integration process has and could divert the attention of management and any difficulties or problems encountered in the transition process could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  the process of combining companies has and could cause the interruption of  or a loss of momentum in  the activities of the respective businesses  which could have an adverse effect on their combined operations 
there can be no assurance that we will realize any of the anticipated benefits of mergers 
we may have difficulty in managing our growth the growth in the size of our business and operations has placed and is expected to continue to place a significant strain on our management 
our future growth is limited in part by the size and location of our distribution centers 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully expand our existing distribution facilities or open new distribution facilities in new or existing markets to facilitate growth 
in addition  our growth strategy to expand our market presence includes possible additional acquisitions 
to the extent our future growth includes acquisitions  there can be no assurance that we will successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates  consummate and integrate such potential acquisitions or expand into new markets 
our ability to compete effectively and to manage future growth  if any  will depend on our ability to continue to implement and improve operational  financial and management information systems on a timely basis and to expand  train  motivate and manage our work force 
there can be no assurance that our personnel  systems  procedures and controls will be adequate to support our operations 
our inability to manage our growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we have significant competition from a variety of sources we operate in competitive markets  and our future success will be largely dependent on our ability to provide quality products and services at competitive prices 
our competition comes from a variety of sources  including other distributors of natural products as well as specialty grocery and mass market grocery distributors 
there can be no assurance that mass market grocery distributors will not increase their emphasis on natural products and more directly compete with us or that new competitors will not enter the market 
these distributors may have been in business longer than us  may have substantially greater financial and other resources than us and may be better established in their markets 
there can be no assurance that our current or potential competitors will not provide services comparable or superior to those provided by us or adapt more quickly than we do to evolving industry trends or changing market requirements 
it is also possible that alliances among competitors may develop and rapidly acquire significant market share or that certain of our customers will increase distribution to their own retail facilities 
increased competition may result in price reductions  reduced gross margins and loss of market share  any of which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively against current and future competitors 
we depend heavily on our principal customer our current distribution arrangement with our largest customer  whole foods market  was in effect through august  on july   we announced that our current distribution agreement with whole foods markets had been extended through december   under the same terms as the existing agreement 
whole foods market accounted for approximately and of our net sales during the fiscal years ended july  and  respectively 
as a result of this concentration of our customer base  the loss or cancellation of business from whole foods market including from increased distribution to its own facilities  could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we sell products under purchase orders  and we generally have no agreements with or commitments from our customers for the purchase of products 
no assurance can be given that our customers will maintain or increase their sales volumes or orders for the products supplied by us or that we will be able to maintain or add to our existing customer base 
with the implementation of our primary distribution agreement with wild oats markets during the second half of fiscal  our sales to whole foods markets as a percentage of our total sales may decline over the next twelve months  and our sales to wild oats markets may increase as a percentage of our total net sales over the next twelve months 
our profit margins may decrease due to consolidation in the grocery industry the grocery distribution industry generally is characterized by relatively high volume with relatively low profit margins 
the continuing consolidation of retailers in the natural products industry and the growth of supernatural chains may reduce our profit margins in the future as more customers qualify for greater volume discounts  and we experience pricing pressures from both ends of the supply chain 
our operations are sensitive to economic downturns the grocery industry is also sensitive to national and regional economic conditions and the demand for our products may be adversely affected from time to time by economic downturns 
in addition  our operating results are particularly sensitive to  and may be materially adversely affected by difficulties with the collectibility of accounts receivable  difficulties with inventory control  competitive pricing pressures  and unexpected increases in fuel or other transportation related costs 
there can be no assurance that one or more of such factors will not materially adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we are dependent on a number of key executives management of our business is substantially dependent upon the services of richard antonelli  president of united distribution  daniel v 
atwood  senior vice president of marketing and secretary  rick d 
puckett  chief financial officer and treasurer  steven h 
townsend  chairman  president and chief executive officer  and other key management employees 
loss of the services of any officers or any other key management employee could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our operating results are subject to significant fluctuations our net sales and operating results may vary significantly from period to period due to demand for natural products  changes in our operating expenses  including in fuel and insurance  management s ability to execute our business and growth strategies  changes in customer preferences and demands for natural products  including levels of enthusiasm for health  fitness and environmental issues  fluctuation of natural product prices due to competitive pressures  personnel changes  supply shortages  general economic conditions  lack of an adequate supply of high quality agricultural products due to poor growing conditions  natural disasters or otherwise  volatility in prices of high quality agricultural products resulting from poor growing conditions  natural disasters or otherwise  and future acquisitions  particularly in periods immediately following the consummation of such acquisition transactions while the operations of the acquired businesses are being integrated into our operations 
due to the foregoing factors  we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results may not necessarily be meaningful and that such comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
we are subject to significant governmental regulation our business is highly regulated at the federal  state and local levels and our products and distribution operations require various licenses  permits and approvals 
in particular our products are subject to inspection by the us food and drug administration  our warehouse and distribution facilities are subject to inspection by the us department of agriculture and state health authorities  and the us department of transportation and the us federal highway administration regulate our trucking operations 
the loss or revocation of any existing licenses  permits or approvals or the failure to obtain any additional licenses  permits or approvals in new jurisdictions where we intend to do business could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
union organizing activities could cause labor relations difficulties as of july   we had approximately  full and part time employees 
an aggregate of approximately  or  of the employees at our auburn  washington  iowa city  iowa and edison  new jersey facilities are covered by collective bargaining agreements 
these agreements expire in march  june and june  respectively 
we have in the past been the focus of union organizing efforts 
as we increase our employee base and broaden our distribution operations to new geographic markets  our increased visibility could result in increased or expanded union organizing efforts 
although we have not experienced a work stoppage to date  if additional employees were to unionize  we could be subject to work stoppages and increases in labor costs  either of which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
access to capital and the cost of that capital we have a secured revolving credit facility with available credit under it of million at an interest rate of libor plus maturing on march  as of july   our borrowing base  based on accounts receivable and inventory levels  was million  with remaining availability of million 
in april  we executed a term loan agreement in the principal amount of million secured by the real property that was released in accordance with an amendment to the loan and security agreement related to the revolving credit facility 
the million term loan is repayable over seven years based on a fifteen year amortization schedule 
interest on the term loan accrues at libor plus 
in december  we amended this term loan agreement by increasing the principal amount from million to million under the existing terms and conditions 
in order to maintain our profit margins  we rely on strategic investment buying initiatives  such as discounted bulk purchases  which require spending significant amounts of working capital 
in the event that our cost of capital increases or our ability to borrow funds or raise equity capital is limited  we could suffer reduced profit margins and be unable to grow our business organically or through acquisitions  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to interest rate fluctuations on our borrowings 
as more fully described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  we use interest rate swap agreements to modify variable rate obligations to fixed rate obligations 
beginning in  we began managing portions of our debt portfolio by using interest rate swaps to achieve a desired mix of fixed rates 
at july   we had one interest rate swap relating to our million term loan agreement 
we account for our interest rate swap agreement entered into during may swap using hedge accounting treatment as the derivative has been determined to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value of the hedged items 
the agreement provides for us to pay interest for a seven year period at a fixed rate of on a notional principal amount of million while receiving interest for the same period at the libor rate on the same notional principal amount 
the swap has been entered into as a hedge against libor interest rate movements on current variable rate indebtedness totaling million at libor plus  thereby fixing our effective rate on the notional amount at 
under this method of accounting  at july  and  we recorded a million asset representing gross unrealized gains on this derivative  and a corresponding credit to accumulated other comprehensive income in the statement of stockholders equity 
we do not enter into derivative agreements for trading purposes 
at july   the company has long term floating rate debt of million and long term fixed rate debt of million  representing and  respectively  of total debt 
at july   the company has floating rate debt of million and fixed rate debt of million  representing and  respectively  of total debt 
holding other variables constant such as swaps and debt levels  a basis point decrease in interest rates would increase the unrealized fair market value of the fixed rate debt by approximately  and  at july  and  respectively 
at july  and  the after tax earnings and cash flows impact for next year resulting from a basis point increase in interest rates would be approximately  and  respectively  holding other variables constant
