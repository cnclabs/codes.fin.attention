liquidity and capital resources the accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming the company will continue as a going concern 
the company has suffered recurring losses from operations and as of june  had a working capital deficit of  these conditions raise substantial doubt about the company s ability to continue as a going concern 
management recognizes that in order to meet the company s capital requirements  and continue to operate  additional funding is necessary 
the company is exploring additional sources of liquidity  through debt and equity financing alternatives and potential sales of its common stock in private placement transactions 
additionally the company is negotiating the restructure of its long term debt 
if the company is i unable to grow its business or improve its operating cash flows as expected  ii unsuccessful in extending a substantial portion of the debt repayments currently past due  or iii unable to raise additional funds through private placement sales of its common stock  then the company may be unable to continue as a going concern 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available when needed or  if available  that it will be on terms favorable to the company and its stockholders 
if the company is not successful in generating sufficient cash flows from operations  or in raising additional capital when required in sufficient amounts and on terms acceptable to the company  these failures would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities  the percentage ownership of the company s current shareholders would be diluted 
these consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of these uncertainties

non cash charges of  consist primarily of  goodwill impairment   in depreciation an amortization charges and issuance of common stock for services and contract settlement of  offset by  of amortization of an unfavorable airline contract

prior to july  july  july  total june  to june  to june  and thereafter purchase obligations     long term notes payable     operating and capital lease obligations     critical accounting policies determination of certain amounts in the company s financial statements requires the use of estimates 
these estimates are based upon the company s historical experiences combined with management s understanding of current facts and circumstances 
although the estimates are considered reasonable  actual results could differ from the estimates 
discussed below are the accounting policies considered by management to require the most judgment and to be critical in the preparation of the financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains an allowance for customer accounts that reduces receivables to amounts that are expected to be collected 
in estimating the allowance  management considers factors such as current overall economic conditions  industry specific economic conditions  historical and anticipated customer performance  historical experience with write offs and the level of past due amounts 
changes in these conditions may result in additional allowances 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was  and  at june  and june   respectively 
goodwill goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events suggest impairment exists 
the test for impairment requires the company to make several estimates about fair value  most of which are based on projected future cash flows 
the estimates associated with the goodwill impairment tests are considered critical due to the judgments required in determining fair value amounts  including projected future cash flows 
changes in these estimates may result in the recognition of an impairment loss 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk generally represents the risk of loss that may result from the potential change in value of a financial instrument as a result of fluctuations in interest rates and market prices 
we do not currently have any trading derivatives nor do we expect to have any in the future 
we have established policies and internal processes related to the management of market risks  which we use in the normal course of our business operations 
intangible asset risk we have a substantial amount of intangible assets 
we are required to perform goodwill impairment tests at least on an annual basis and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable from estimated future cash flows 
as a result of our annual and other periodic evaluations  we may determine that the intangible asset values need to be written down to their fair values  which could result in material charges that could be adverse to our operating results and financial position 
although at june   we believe our intangible assets are recoverable  changes in the economy  the business in which we operate and our own relative performance could change the assumptions used to evaluate intangible asset recoverability 
we continue to monitor those assumptions and their consequent effect on the estimated recoverability of our intangible assets 
commodity price risk we do not enter into contracts for the purchase or sale of commodities 
as a result  we do not currently have any direct commodity price risk
