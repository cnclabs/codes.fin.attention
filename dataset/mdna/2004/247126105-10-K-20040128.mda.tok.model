item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations outlook and note to our consolidated financial statements 
employee and product line charges 
during the third quarter of  in connection with finalizing a new four year collective bargaining agreement with the international union  united automobile  aerospace  and agricultural implement workers of america uaw  we had an opportunity to initiate actions intended to address under performing operations  appropriately size our global hourly and salaried workforces and strengthen our competitive position 
also  as discussed above  in november  we 
table of contents announced the consolidation of our safety interior division and the additional consolidation of certain staffs to eliminate duplication of efforts and drive incremental savings 
as a result of specific accounting rules  we are required to record certain of the charges associated with the global actions when they actually occur eg when an employee accepts an offer 
we expect that total charges related to these actions will be approximately million after tax  of which million after tax has been recorded through december  we expect that the remaining million after tax will be recorded in as a result of these initiatives  we expect to reduce our us hourly workforce by up to  employees  the us salaried workforce by approximately employees  and our non us workforce by approximately  employees 
these us hourly reductions will occur through a variety of methods including regular attrition and retirements  employees returning to gm flowbacks  and voluntary and involuntary separations  as applicable 
also in the third quarter of  we received a ruling in our previously disclosed grievance proceeding with the iue cwa  the industrial division of the communications workers of america  afl cio  clc iue cwa over certain planned layoffs at one of our manufacturing facilities 
the arbitrator directed us to restore the level of bargaining unit employees to  and to make the recalled employees whole 
in november  we also finalized a four year labor agreement with the iue cwa which further provides opportunities to address our employment cost reduction initiatives noted above through a variety of methods including regular attrition and retirements  and voluntary and involuntary separations  as applicable 
in the third quarter of  we recorded plans related to the attrition or idling of approximately  us uaw hourly employees and iue cwa hourly employees at our packard operations  both of which are included in the  discussed above  as well as approximately us salaried employees and approximately  us employees 
in addition  we recorded charges to make recalled employees whole at the iue cwa manufacturing site in accordance with the arbitration award discussed above 
our fourth quarter charges for employee and product lines related to the employees who accepted our offers  and include employees impacted by the consolidation of the division and staffs 
we also evaluated for impairment the carrying value of the long lived assets at sites impacted by our plans  and recorded impairment losses of million in the impairment losses  primarily related to buildings and equipment held for use in the ahg sector  were recorded as depreciation and amortization 
additionally  during  we recorded charges to cost of sales of million 
of this amount  million relates to retiree payments to be paid pursuant to the national labor agreements with the uaw and the iue cwa  and the remaining amount is primarily attributable to inventory and warranty matters 
we expect to realize savings related to these restructuring initiatives  which we expect will grow to approximately million after tax on an annual basis 
as of december   approximately  us hourly employees  us salaried employees  and  non us employees have left the company pursuant to these plans 
an additional us salaried employees left on january  acquisitions in november  delphi acquired grundig car intermedia system gmbh grundig  a wholly owned subsidiary of grundig ag  for approximately million  net of cash acquired 
grundig is a full line producer of vehicle audio systems  telematics devices and other vehicle entertainment products primarily for the european automotive original equipment and aftermarket segments 
with this acquisition  delphi will significantly boost its european electronic sales  strengthen customer relationships and achieve synergy savings through integration 

table of contents industry the automotive parts industry provides components  systems  subsystems and modules to vms for the manufacture of new vehicles  as well as to the aftermarket for use as replacement parts for current production and older vehicles 
we believe that several key trends have been reshaping the automotive parts industry over the past several years increasing electronic and technological content 
the electronic and technological content of vehicles continues to expand  largely driven by consumer demand for greater vehicle performance  functionality and affordable convenience options as a result of increased communication abilities in vehicles as well as increasingly stringent regulatory standards for energy efficiency  emissions reduction  and increased safety through crash avoidance and occupant protection systems 
electronics integration  which generally refers to products that combine integrated circuits  software algorithms  sensor technologies and mechanical components within the vehicle  allows vms to achieve substantial reductions in weight and mechanical complexity  resulting in easier assembly  enhanced fuel economy  improved emissions control and better vehicle performance 
the technology content of vehicles continues to increase as consumers demand greater safety  entertainment  productivity and convenience while driving 
advanced technologies offering mobile voice and data communication such as those used in our mobile electronics products coupled with global positioning sensors and in vehicle entertainment are making steady inroads into the transportation industry 
global capabilities of suppliers 
in order to serve multiple markets in a more cost effective manner  many vms are turning to global vehicle platforms such as world cars  which typically are designed in one location but produced and sold in many different geographic markets around the world 
broader global markets for vehicle sales and the desire of vms to adapt their products to satisfy regional and cultural variations have driven suppliers to establish capabilities within the major regions  as they follow their customers 
optimizing supply chain value stream 
in order to continue to respond to increasingly competitive market pricing dynamics  suppliers are establishing comprehensive plans to remove waste from the enterprise value stream 
this includes optimizing the flow of information between the vm  the tier supplier a supplier which sells directly to a vm  and other tiers of the supply chain 
value stream efficiencies are also increasingly being achieved through earlier collaboration between vms and suppliers in the advanced product design  engineering and manufacturing phases of the product delivery cycle 
additional benefits are also being realized due to greater collaboration between tier and lower tier suppliers on product design  material selection  manufacturing  processing  and product packaging 
many of these efficiencies are enabled by internet based supply chain management tools  computerized modeling and computerized product design software tools 
increased emphasis on systems and modules sourcing 
to simplify the vehicle design and assembly processes and reduce their costs  vms increasingly look to their suppliers to provide fully engineered systems and pre assembled combinations of components rather than individual components 
by offering sophisticated systems and modules rather than individual components  tier suppliers such as delphi have assumed many of the design  engineering  research and development and assembly functions traditionally performed by vms 
in addition  suppliers often manufacture and ship components to the general location of a vm s assembly line and then provide local assembly of systems and modules 
ongoing industry consolidation 
the trend of consolidation among worldwide suppliers is expected to continue as suppliers seek to achieve operating synergies and value stream efficiencies through business combinations  build stronger customer relationships by following their customers as they expand globally  acquire complementary technologies  and shift production among locations 
the need for suppliers to provide vms with single point sourcing of integrated systems and modules on a global basis has also fueled industry consolidation 
additionally  vms are experiencing rapid consolidation which impacts customer supplier relationships and provides opportunities and risks as suppliers attempt to secure global supply contracts across broader vehicle platforms 

table of contents shorter product development cycles 
suppliers are under pressure from vms to respond more quickly with new designs and product innovations to support rapidly changing consumer tastes and regulatory requirements 
for example  vehicle demand in north america has shifted from cars to light trucks and vans over the last several years  and  more recently  crossover and hybrid vehicles are being introduced into the market 
these trends will require suppliers to modify their operations to focus on parts for these vehicles 
in developing countries  broad economic improvements continue to be made  increasing the demand for smaller  less expensive vehicles that satisfy basic transportation needs 
in addition  increasingly stringent government regulations regarding vehicle safety and environmental standards are accelerating new product development cycles 
research and development delphi maintains technical engineering centers in every major region of the world to develop and provide advanced products  processes and manufacturing support for all of our manufacturing sites and to provide our customers with local engineering capabilities and design development on a global basis 
in december  we announced that we were opening two new technical centers  located in china and in korea 
as of december   we employed more than  engineers  scientists and technicians around the world with over one third focused on electronic and high technology products  including software algorithm development 
we introduced approximately new products and processes in  which is a increase over we believe that our engineering and technical expertise  together with our emphasis on continuing research and development  allows us to use the latest technologies  materials and processes to solve problems for our customers and to bring new  innovative products to market 
we believe that continued research and development activities including engineering are critical to maintaining our pipeline of technologically advanced products 
we have aggressively managed costs in other portions of our business in order to maintain our total expenditures for research and development activities including engineering at approximately billion for the year ended december  and billion for each of the years ended december  and intellectual property we have generated a large number of patents in the operation of our business 
at present  we own full or partial interests in more than  patents and  patent applications worldwide 
this portfolio has continued to grow as we actively pursue additional technological innovation 
while no individual patent taken alone is considered material to our business  taken in the aggregate  these patents are critical to supporting continued technological innovation 
similarly  while our trademarks are important to identify delphi s position in the industry  and we have obtained certain licenses to use intellectual property owned by others  we do not believe that any of these are individually material to our business 
we are actively pursuing marketing opportunities to commercialize and license our technology to both automotive and non automotive industries 
this leveraging activity is expected to further enhance the value of our intellectual property portfolio 
products and competition although the overall number of our competitors has decreased due to ongoing industry consolidation  the automotive parts industry remains extremely competitive 
vms rigorously evaluate suppliers on the basis of product quality  price competitiveness  reliability and timeliness of delivery  product design capability  technical expertise and development capability  new product innovation  leanness of facilities  operational flexibility  customer service and overall management 
during  our product offerings were organized in two product sectors dynamics  propulsion thermal and electrical  electronics  safety interior  as well as the automotive holdings group 
as discussed above  we realigned our safety interior systems division  effective january  and our new sectors are electrical  electronics  safety and dynamics  propulsion  thermal interior 

table of contents to our knowledge  no other tier supplier competes across the full range of our product areas within the automotive industry and other transportation markets 
our product sector offerings and principal competitors as of december   which includes product offerings that are impacted by the realignment  are described below 
dynamics  propulsion thermal

this sector is one of the leading global providers of automotive electronics in addition to being a global leader in the production of connectors  wiring harnesses  switches and sensors for electrical electronic systems 
the sector also offers a wide range of products related to vehicle safety systems as well as the expertise to integrate them into individual vehicle designs to simplify manufacturer assembly and enhance vehicle marketability 
in addition to original equipment supply  the sector is also responsible for delphi s growing aftermarket business offering products and services to a wide variety of customers 
principal competitors for the electrical  electronics  safety interior sector include autoliv inc  robert bosch gmbh  denso inc  motorola inc  siemens ag  trw automotive  visteon corporation  and yazaki corporation 
our principal electrical  electronics  safety interior product lines include a complete range of advanced audio systems and components  including satellite reception systems for vehicles and home use and fully integrated audio systems providing a variety of playback formats and which may be tailored to the requirements of specific customers  wireless products which provide mobile connectivity  entertainment and information  powertrain and engine control modules incorporating state of the art computer technology to measure and optimize vehicle performance  improve fuel economy and reduce emissions  sensors and actuators for advanced digital control systems  body and security systems  safety systems electronics including passenger detection systems with advanced electronic sensors  reception systems for vehicle entertainment  communication and information system solutions  collision warning systems  connection systems  switches and mechatronic devices  electrical electronic distribution systems  electrical centers  occupant protection systems  door modules  power closure systems  cockpit and interior systems  and modular products that unify several systems and subsystems into one simple to install piece for the manufacturer

automotive holdings group 
our automotive holdings group ahg accounted for billion of our sales excluding inter sector sales 
ahg is comprised of plant sites and product lines that do not meet our targets for net income or other financial metrics 
ahg enables consistent and targeted management focus on finding solutions for these businesses and sites 
by bringing a separate reporting structure for the ahg  we have created a better environment for change 
we have increased transparency  accountability  focus and the level of urgency 
ahg fosters an entrepreneurial approach where there are no one size fits all solutions and all the key stakeholders  customers  unions  employees  suppliers and communities alike are being engaged to help resolve issues 
our principal ahg product lines include halfshafts  condensers  batteries  filters  spark plugs  generators and compressors 
we originally had twelve plant sites included in the ahg 
one site was closed in and we are working to consolidate an additional four sites 
customers we primarily sell our products and services to the major global vms 
as a percentage of sales  our non gm sales were in while our business with customers other than gm  including sales to other tier i suppliers that supply gm has increased since our separation from gm in the separation  and we expect such business to continue to increase over time  we also expect that gm will remain our largest customer for a significant period of time due to the long term nature of sales contracts in our industry and our strong customer supplier relationship with gm 
our sales to gm have declined since the separation  principally reflecting the impact of customer trends  the exit of some businesses  as well as gm s diversification of its supply base and changes in our vehicle content and the product mix supplied to them 
while we intend to continue to focus on retaining and winning gm s business  we cannot provide assurance that we will succeed in doing so 
additionally  our revenues may be affected by increases or decreases in gm s business or market share 
we continue to project our sales beyond to grow modestly with non gm sales increasing and gm sales likely decreasing  assuming projected production levels  consistency of current market trends and our ability to exit businesses as planned 
we currently supply parts to each regional sector of gm s automotive operations  including its automotive operations in the united states  canada and mexico gm north america  and gm s automotive operations throughout the rest of the world gm international 
in addition  we sell our products to the worldwide aftermarket for replacement parts  including gm s service and parts operations gm spo and to other distributors and retailers independent aftermarket 
the following table shows this breakdown of our total net sales for each of the last three years 
total net sales year ended december  customer dollars in millions gm north america gm international gm spo total gm other customers total net sales 
table of contents included in sales to other customers in the foregoing table are sales to each of the major global vms other than gm 
sales to three of these other major global vms exceeded million in including ford motor company  daimlerchrysler corporation  and renault nissan motor company  ltd 
also included in sales to other customers are sales to independent aftermarket customers and sales to consumer electronics customers consumer electronics  which were million in  as compared to million in additionally  we have sales to manufacturers of medium duty and heavy duty trucks and off road equipment commercial vehicles  and other new customers beyond our traditional automotive customer base new markets 
we are continuing our efforts to diversify our business by supplying certain products  including audio systems  batteries  fiber optic links  electronics cooling systems  connection systems  flex circuits  wiring  instrumentation  pressure sensors  safety systems  and engine management systems and components to these non vm customers 
these products are used in the commercial vehicle  construction  aftermarket  recreational vehicle eg  boats  motorcycle  aerospace  defense  medical  appliance  consumer electronics  and computer industries 
we have over  independent aftermarket customers including our consumer electronics customers such as wal mart  best buy  and circuit city 
in addition  our commercial vehicle and new markets customers include caterpillar  deere and company  freightliner  volvo truck  hyundai  tata motors  paccar  international truck  harley davidson  lockheed martin  general electric  siemens medical  and raytheon 
we expect these sales to grow rapidly in future years as we commercialize existing technology and continue our focus on diversifying our customer base  although we can provide no assurance that this will occur 
in  sales to our commercial vehicle and new markets customers  including consumer electronics that are sold through the independent aftermarket  were  million as compared to million for variability in delphi s business a significant portion of our business is generally related to automotive sales  which vary directly with the production schedules of our vm customers 
the market for vehicles is cyclical and dependent on general economic conditions  consumer spending and preferences 
the rate at which our customers build vehicles depends on their market performance as well as company specific inventory and incentive strategies 
any significant reduction or increase in automotive production by our customers may have a material effect on our business 
we have substantial operations in every major region of the world and economic conditions in these regions often differ  which may have varying effects on our business 
our business is moderately seasonal as our primary north american customers historically halt operations for approximately two weeks in july and approximately one week in december 
our european customers generally reduce production during the months of july and august and one week in december 
in addition  third quarter automotive production is traditionally lower as new models enter production 
accordingly  our results may reflect this seasonality 
raw materials we purchase various raw materials for use in manufacturing our products 
the principal raw materials we purchase include platinum group metals  copper  aluminum  steel  lead and resins 
all of these raw materials  except the platinum group metals  which we use primarily to produce our catalytic converters  are available from numerous sources 
currently  most of the platinum group metals we use for catalytic converters produced for gm are procured directly from gm 
delphi purchases its remaining platinum group metal requirements directly from delphi suppliers  which primarily obtain or produce platinum group metals from locations in south africa  north america and russia 
we have not experienced any significant shortages of other raw materials and normally do not carry inventories of such raw materials in excess of those reasonably required to meet our production and shipping schedules 
throughout significant price or supply issues related to steel did not impact delphi 
in december  the us government repealed certain trade protective measures that had been in place with respect to steel 
we purchase steel under long term commitments that throughout will mitigate any risk of supply issues 
however  there can be no assurance that there will be no price or supply issues over the long term 

table of contents environmental compliance we are subject to the requirements of us federal  state  local and non us environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations 
these include laws regulating air emissions  water discharge and waste management 
we have an environmental management structure designed to facilitate and support our compliance with these requirements globally 
although it is our intent to comply with all such requirements and regulations  we cannot provide assurance that we are at all times in compliance 
we have made and will continue to make capital and other expenditures to comply with environmental requirements  the amount of such expenditures were not material during the past three years and we do not expect such expenditures to be material in environmental requirements are complex  change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time 
accordingly  we cannot provide assurance that these requirements will not change or become more stringent in the future 
delphi is subject to complex laws governing the protection of the environment and requiring investigation and cleanup of environmental contamination 
we are in various stages of investigation and cleanup at our manufacturing sites where contamination has been discovered 
as previously disclosed  delphi received notices that it is a potentially responsible party prp in proceedings at various sites  including the tremont city landfill site located in tremont  ohio 
the tremont city landfill site proceeding  which is alleged to concern ground water contamination  is in the early stages of investigation and involves multiple other prps 
based on the information gathered to date  delphi has been identified as the largest waste generator prp  however  we expect that other parties  including landfill operator and transporter prps  will ultimately have to share a significant portion of any overall site costs 
in september  delphi and other prps entered into a consent order with the environmental protection agency epa to perform a remedial investigation and feasibility study concerning a portion of the site 
the investigation is expected to be completed during  as various epa reviews are required through each phase of the study 
we had reserved approximately million for our share of the expected investigation costs 
preliminary assessments indicate that a reasonably possible outcome of the investigative study is capping and future monitoring of this site  which would substantially limit future remediation costs 
based on cost estimates received to date  we have included an estimate of the potential costs of capping and future monitoring of the site in our overall reserve estimates 
because the scope of the investigation and the extent of the required remediation are still being determined  it is possible that the final resolution of this matter may require that we make material future expenditures for remediation  possibly over an extended period of time and possibly in excess of our existing reserves 
as the investigation proceeds  we will periodically re assess any potential remediation costs and  as appropriate  our overall environmental reserves 
we may be named as a prp at other sites in the future  including with respect to divested and acquired businesses 
when it has been possible to provide reasonable estimates of our liability with respect to environmental sites  provisions have been made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
as of december   our reserve for such environmental investigation and cleanup was approximately million  which reflects in part the retention by gm of the environmental liability for certain inactive sites as part of the separation 
we cannot ensure that environmental requirements will not change or become more stringent over time or that our eventual environmental cleanup costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of our current reserves 
arrangements between delphi and gm the separation of delphi from gm was effective january   when we assumed the assets and related liabilities of gm s automotive components businesses 
in connection with the separation  we entered into agreements allocating assets  liabilities and responsibilities in a number of areas including taxes  environmental matters  intellectual property  product liability claims  warranty  employee matters  and general litigation claims 
we also agreed to indemnify gm against substantially all losses  claims  damages  liabilities or activities arising out of or in connection with our business post separation 
all of the agreements that we entered into in connection with our separation from gm were made in the context of our parent subsidiary relationship 
the terms of these agreements may be more or less favorable to us than if they had been negotiated with unaffiliated third parties 
before the separation  we depended upon other 
table of contents business sectors of gm and some of gm s affiliates and suppliers for certain services 
although at levels substantially below the levels at the time of separation  gm continues to provide a number of services to us under various transition services agreements 
in connection with the separation we also agreed to keep gm informed of any proposal to close a plant  eliminate a product line or divest of a division  and in good faith reasonably consider gm s concerns 
upon our selection of a qualified buyer  existing contracts with gm relating to the business being sold may be assigned to the buyer upon gm s consent  which will not be unreasonably withheld 
for the past two years  delphi has been bidding for gm s business on the same basis as our competitors 
while we cannot provide any assurance as to our future business with gm  our win rate for defending existing gm business for which we were the incumbent was in excess of for in the fourth quarter of  gm and delphi reached agreement on a growth and opportunity process that provides for advanced review of gm sourcing opportunities that can help stabilize business at delphi s us legacy sites 
this initiative is part of delphi s overall efforts to strengthen the competitive position of certain north american operations through cost reductions and revenue growth opportunities 
vm supply agreements 
gm continues to be our largest customer and to compete effectively  we will need to continue to satisfy gm s pricing  service  technology and increasingly stringent quality and reliability requirements  which  because we are gm s largest supplier  particularly affect us 
our business with gm and with other vms is governed by applicable supply contracts 
consistent with gm s contracts with other suppliers  on a case by case basis  gm may terminate a supply contract including supply contracts in place prior to the separation with delphi and re source the business to another supplier for a variety of factors  such as our non competitiveness including  in many cases  price as well as quality  service  design  and technology  cause  expiration and  in some cases  termination for convenience 
however  except with respect to annual purchase orders  where gm is exercising its re sourcing rights due to non competitiveness for a particular product  gm is required to notify us of any such non competitiveness and provide us with a reasonable period of time during which to correct any such non competitiveness before gm may re source the business 
termination for convenience means gm can terminate the contract at any time for any reason 
the majority of our supply contracts with gm having termination for convenience provisions are annual purchase orders or long term contracts 
with respect to long term contracts entered into prior to october   gm had agreed that it would not re source for non competitive pricing or exercise its right to terminate for convenience during the first months of the contract 
with respect to long term contracts signed after october   gm has eliminated its right to terminate the contract for convenience except in the case of cancellation or substantial modification of the related vehicle program  however gm may re source for non competitive pricing at any time during the contract period  subject to the requirement of notice and reasonable opportunity for us to become competitive 
in addition  our supply contracts with gm generally give gm the right to terminate in the event of a change in control of delphi 
termination of a majority of our supply contracts with gm would likely have a material adverse effect on our company 
our supply contracts also cover service parts we provide to gm for sale to gm authorized dealers worldwide 
generally  similar to supply contracts with other vms  the unit pricing on service parts that are not past model will continue at the prices charged to gm until three years after such service parts go past model 
the term past model refers to parts which are used on vehicle models which are no longer in production 
thereafter  unit prices for such service parts will be negotiated between the parties 
aftermarket sales 
through december   aftermarket sales in the united states were covered by a memorandum of understanding mou between gm spo and delphi entered into in under the mou  delphi was entitled to directly sell and distribute products to the aftermarket in the united states 
in addition  the mou provided that we would continue to supply volumes of aftermarket products to gm spo in the united states at a level based on prior year s sales  adjusted by mutual agreement for business and market conditions  pursuant to separate supply agreements each  an aftermarket supply agreement 
pricing under the aftermarket supply agreements was based on the pricing in effect during calendar year  subject to mutually agreeable market based adjustments from 
table of contents time to time 
under each aftermarket supply agreement  if we met the market price for a particular aftermarket product  gm spo was required to buy such aftermarket product from us 
alternatively  if we chose not to meet the market price for a particular aftermarket product  gm spo could re source and delphi would cease supplying such product to gm spo for the aftermarket in the united states or gm spo could purchase the products from delphi at the higher price 
since the aftermarket supply agreement expired on december   beginning in  we will negotiate with gm spo standard gm purchase order terms for those products that gm wants to continue to source from delphi 
we do not believe the expiration of the aftermarket supply agreements will have a material adverse impact on our aftermarket sales to gm spo 
employee matters 
as part of the separation  we entered into several agreements with gm to allocate responsibility and liability for certain employee related matters 
in connection with our separation from gm  gm granted the uaw guarantees covering benefits to be provided to certain former us hourly employees who became our employees 
we have entered into an agreement with gm that requires us to indemnify gm if gm is called on under this guarantee 
our indemnification obligations remain in effect until october  as a means of mitigating the risk that the guarantee will be called upon  we have also agreed until october  to consult with gm before taking certain fundamental corporate actions and obtain gm s consent not to be unreasonably withheld before entering into transactions which might significantly adversely affect our ability to meet our pension and postretirement benefits such as would cause our credit rating to be downgraded below b from moody s or b from standard poors 
we are currently rated baa by moody s and bbb by standard poors 
flowback rights 
certain of our hourly employees in the us are provided with opportunities to transfer to gm as appropriate job openings become available at gm and gm employees in the us have similar opportunities to transfer to our company to the extent job openings become available at our company 
if such a transfer occurs  in general  both our company and gm will be responsible for pension payments  which in total reflect such employee s entire eligible years of service 
allocation of responsibility between delphi and gm will be on a pro rata basis depending on the length of service at each company although service at delphi includes service with gm prior to the separation 
there will be no transfer of pension assets or liabilities between gm and us with respect to such employees that transfer between our companies 
the company  to which the employee transfers  however  will be responsible for postretirement opeb obligations 
an agreement with gm provides for a mechanism for determining a cash settlement amount for opeb obligations also calculated on a pro rata basis associated with employees that transfer between our company and gm 
employees union representation as of december   we employed approximately  people  of whom approximately  were salaried employees and approximately  were hourly employees 
considering the employees that left effective january   we employed approximately  on a comparable basis  as of december   we employed approximately  people 
as of december   a significant number of our hourly employees are represented by approximately unions worldwide  including approximately  by the uaw  approximately  by the iue cwa and approximately  by the united steel workers uswa 
the delphi uaw national labor agreement and the delphi iue cwa national labor agreement expired in september and november  respectively 
we entered into a new contract  covering a four year term through with each union 
we assumed the terms of existing collective bargaining agreements for our us employees represented by other unions  including those represented by the uswa  in connection with the separation 
the delphi uswa national labor agreement expires in september 
table of contents item properties our world headquarters campus is located in troy  michigan 
we occupy this facility  as well as certain other facilities  under lease agreements 
regional headquarters are also maintained in tokyo  japan  paris  france  and s o paulo  brazil 
excluding our joint ventures and other investments  we currently maintain approximately sites in countries throughout the world  including manufacturing facilities  technical centers  and customer centers and sales offices 
of the sites  are owned and are leased in the united states and canada  are owned and are leased in mexico  are owned and are leased in europe middle east africa  are owned and are leased in south america and are owned and are leased in asia pacific 
we are continuously evaluating plans for effective worldwide engineering and technical centers to provide a customer focused engineering support network 
we believe these efforts will continue to enhance the engineering and technical support provided to our customers around the world  while controlling associated operating costs 
in december  we announced our investment in two new technical centers in shanghai  china and seoul  korea  which are included in the sites above 
we believe that our facilities are suitable and adequate  and have sufficient productive capacity  to meet our current anticipated needs 
item legal proceedings we are involved in routine litigation incidental to the conduct of our business 
although we do not believe litigation to which we are currently a party will have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition  we face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the failure of our products results or is alleged to result in personal injury or death  and we cannot provide assurance that we will not experience any material product liability losses in the future 
in addition  as we successfully diversify our customer base and adapt our automotive technology to new markets  we may or may not face an increased risk of product liability suits as plaintiffs become more aware of our independent existence from gm and we become more visible to the end consumer of our products 
with respect to product liability  if any delphi designed products are or are alleged to be defective  we may be required to participate in a recall involving such products 
each vm has its own policy regarding product recalls and other product liability actions relating to its suppliers 
as suppliers become more integrally involved in the vehicle design process and assume more of the vehicle assembly functions  vms are increasingly looking to their suppliers for contribution when faced with product liability claims 
in connection with the separation  gm agreed to retain responsibility for all product liability actions relating to products we manufactured prior to january  and sold or otherwise supplied to gm either before or after that date 
we are responsible for all product liability actions relating to products we sold at any time to customers other than gm 
responsibility for product liability actions relating to products manufactured on or after january  and sold to gm are determined in accordance with the agreements for such sales 
delphi may also be subject to significant financial and legal obligations with respect to certain divested businesses 
from time to time  in the ordinary course of business  delphi receives notices from customers that products may not function properly 
the terms and conditions of the applicable contract generally govern our warranty responsibility for our products  which vary from contract to contract 
most of our contracts require that we make certain warranties to our customers regarding  among other things  conformity to specifications and freedom from defect 
vms generally offer warranties to new vehicle purchasers  which cover the repair and replacement of defective parts on their vehicles for a specified period of time 
traditionally  vms have borne the cost associated with such warranty programs  including costs related to the repair and replacement of parts supplied to the vehicle manufacturer by the supplier 
vms are increasingly requiring their outside suppliers to bear these costs 
depending on the terms under which delphi supplies products to a vm  a vm might seek to hold delphi responsible for some or all of the repair or replacement costs of such products under new vehicle warranties  when the product supplied did 
table of contents not perform as represented 
notwithstanding that our quality has improved  a few vms have advised delphi that they intend to pursue warranty claims vigorously 
in particular  although in we settled or resolved most of our known pre separation warranty claims with gm  as previously disclosed  gm had requested that delphi agree to reimburse gm for the anticipated costs of gm s voluntary recall campaign to repair certain to models which gm states could experience a failure of the power steering gear lower pinion bearing 
during the third quarter of  we resolved this issue with gm  together with the remainder of known pre separation warranty claims and most outstanding pricing and sourcing disputes with gm 
this agreement included our using the remaining customer credits obtained from gm in although gm may assert additional pre separation claims in the future  we do not know of  nor has gm communicated to us  any outstanding warranty  pricing or sourcing disputes between the companies at this time 
for each of the three years in the period ended december   our warranty expenses have been less than of cost of sales 
although we cannot ensure that the future costs of warranty claims by gm or other customers will not be material  we believe our established reserves are adequate to cover potential warranty settlements 
our warranty reserves are based upon our best estimates of amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims 
we regularly evaluate the appropriateness of these reserves  and make adjustments when appropriate 
however  the final amounts determined to be due related to warranty matters could differ materially from our recorded estimates 
as we actively pursue additional technological innovation in both automotive and non automotive industries and enhance the value of our intellectual property portfolio  we incur ongoing costs to enforce and defend our intellectual property and face an inherent risk of exposure to the claims of other suppliers and parties that we have allegedly violated their intellectual property rights 
we cannot ensure that we will not experience any material warranty or intellectual property claim losses in the future or that we will not incur significant costs to defend such claims 
as previously noted  in may  litex  inc litex filed suit against delphi in federal court in the district of massachusetts alleging infringement of certain patents regarding methods to reduce engine exhaust emissions 
on november   during trial  the parties reached an agreement to dismiss the litigation with prejudice in favor of an agreement to submit the case to binding arbitration 
we expect the arbitration to take place during the first quarter of we believe that we are adequately insured  with respect to product liability coverage  at levels sufficient to cover any potential claims  subject to commercially reasonable deductible amounts 
we have also established reserves in amounts we believe are reasonably adequate to cover any adverse judgments with respect to the other claims described above 
however  any adverse judgment in excess of our insurance coverage and such reserves could have a material adverse effect on our business

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary we are a global supplier of vehicle electronics  transportation components  integrated systems and modules and other electronic technology 
our technologies are present in more than million vehicles on the road worldwide as well as in communication  computer  consumer electronic  energy and medical applications 
we operate in extremely competitive markets 
our customers select us based upon numerous factors including technology  quality and price 
supplier selection is generally finalized several years prior to the start of production of the vehicle 
as a result  business that we win in will generally not impact our financial results until or beyond 
additionally  our results are heavily dependent on overall vehicle production throughout the world 
consistent with one of the primary rationales for separating delphi from general motors gm  we have diversified our customer base significantly since our separation in our sales trend to gm has declined since the separation  principally reflecting the impact of customer trends  the exit of some businesses  as well as gm s diversification of its supply base and changes in our vehicle content and the product mix supplied to them 
critical success factors for us include managing our overall global manufacturing footprint to ensure proper placement and workforce levels in line with business needs as well as competitive wages and benefits  maximizing efficiencies in manufacturing processes  fixing or eliminating unprofitable businesses  including those that are part of our ahg operations  and reducing overall material costs 
in addition  our customers generally require that we demonstrate improved efficiencies  through cost reductions and or price decreases  on a year over year basis 
see results of operations for more details as to the factors  which drive year over year performance 
our net sales were billion  with billion or of sales to non gm customers  up from our gm sales in were billion  down from last year 
net loss for was million 
for the full year  we benefited from the steady growth of the company s non gm business and have continued to diversify our customer base through sales of technology rich products and systems based solutions for vehicles and other non auto applications 
our employee and product line initiatives are on schedule and on track with our original estimated costs 
savings realized from our prior restructuring plans combined with other operating performance improvements have allowed us to continue to manage the challenges of rising wages  pension and healthcare costs  as well as continued price pressures 
we remain focused on reducing structural costs 
a key strength of our business is our ability to consistently generate cash 
our board of directors and management use cash generated by the businesses as a measure of our performance 
strong cash flow is also important to our critical success factors described above 
we use the cash that we generate in our operations to strengthen our balance sheet  including reducing legacy liabilities such as pensions  restructuring our operations  and paying dividends 
we believe that looking at our ability to generate cash provides investors with additional insight into our performance 
see further discussion of cash flows in liquidity and capital resources below 
overview of uaw and iue cwa labor contracts during  the international union  united automobile  aerospace  and agricultural implement workers of america uaw labor contract was finalized  covering a four year term from to this contract includes moderate increases for pension and wages  as well as some progress in reducing healthcare costs through modest increases in some co pays for prescription drugs and adjustments to coverage networks to increase discounts 
the contract includes an up front signing bonus of  per uaw employee  a lump sum payment in year of the contract  and wage increases  respectively for years and of the contract and cost of living adjustments  as applicable 
in addition  retirees will receive per year in lump sum payments and active employees will receive approximately per year increases in future pension benefits 
the impact of the contract on the pension liability was a billion increase to our projected benefit obligation pbo but no material changes in near term 
table of contents erisa funding requirements and a decrease in our opeb liability of about billion 
we are engaged in dialogue with the uaw to pursue our plans to consolidate certain product lines and sites  including ahg operations  and to support our efforts to achieve significant flow of employees to gm flowback 
we are currently engaged in negotiations with the uaw over competitive wage and benefit agreements comparable to wages and benefits paid by other represented automotive suppliers for new hires 
we expect to complete these negotiations during the next days 
in addition  unlike our prior agreement with the uaw  this agreement does not contractually obligate us to mirror any future uaw agreements with gm 
we also finalized  in the fourth quarter of  the labor agreement with the iue cwa  the industrial division of the communications workers of america  afl cio  clc iue cwa 
the principal economics of the iue cwa agreement are consistent with the uaw agreement 
eligible traditional rate employees will receive moderate economic increases in pensions  wages and certain benefits in line with those described above 
the delphi iue cwa agreement enables delphi to build upon existing local agreements that currently provide competitive wages and benefits to approximately  iue cwa represented delphi employees and new hires 
the iue cwa contract further provides opportunities to reduce employees at targeted facilities  including ahg sites  through a variety of methods including regular attrition and retirements  and voluntary and involuntary separations  as applicable 
the iue cwa has been advised of delphi s intent to address plant consolidation issues during the near term of the contract  and has agreed to source a certain product line in our anaheim  california facility  presently part of the ahg  to another facility 
functional and divisional realignments during the fourth quarter  we announced our plans to realign our safety interior occupant protection business with delphi electronics systems 
the new division is named delphi electronics safety 
our plans also realign integrated closure systems  hvac electronic controls  cockpits and interior business lines with existing thermal product lines 
the new division is named delphi thermal interior 
these realignments were effective january  in addition  finance  human resources  information systems  logistics  corporate affairs  communications  marketing communications and sales administration are being consolidated to remove duplications of effort and costs across the divisions and headquarters 
the realignment is designed to strengthen our customer and market focus by bringing together similar product portfolios  as well as to enhance our position as an integrated supplier  and to drive cost reductions 
we believe this realignment will sharpen our focus on our customers and improve communications regarding their product needs 
results of operations versus net sales 
net sales by product sector and in total for the years ended december  and were year ended december  product sector in millions dynamics  propulsion thermal electrical  electronics  safety interior automotive holdings group other net sales 
table of contents net sales for were billion compared to billion for the increase of approximately million was more than explained by approximately million of currency exchange rates  primarily the euro 
our non gm sales increased by billion or  including million resulting from currency exchange rates and million attributable to the grundig car intermedia system gmbh grundig acquisition 
management evaluates year over year performance on a constant exchange rate basis and changes in revenues attributed to movements in currency exchange rates generally do not impact our operating income  see results of operations operating income 
excluding the effects of currency exchange rates  our non gm sales increased million which was due to increased production volumes and new business from diversifying our global customer base  partially offset by price decreases 
as a percent of our net sales for  our non gm sales were 
net sales to gm decreased by million  after million of currency exchange rates 
excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates  our gm sales decreased billion 
this gm sales decrease was due to lower production volumes in north america  price decreases and our decision to exit certain businesses 
our net sales were also impacted by continued price pressures that resulted in price reductions of approximately million  or for compared to approximately million or for on a going forward basis  we expect future annual price reductions to continue to be in the range 
gross margin 
our gross margin was for compared to for the decrease was primarily due to volume reductions of approximately million and million of retiree lump sum payments and inventory and warranty matters 
additionally  we experienced approximately million of higher wages and increased us pension and healthcare costs and approximately million of price decreases are offset by lower material costs  manufacturing performance and savings realized from our restructuring plans 
the gross margin for included a charge of million related to our generator product line 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expense was billion  of total net sales for  compared to billion or of total net sales for selling  general and administrative expense for was adversely impacted by a legal settlement to one of our former suppliers of approximately million million after tax  in connection with a commercial dispute 
excluding the impact of the legal settlement  selling  general and administrative expense was of total net sales for depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization for includes million of charges related to product line impairments 
excluding these impairment charges  depreciation and amortization for was consistent with amounts for employee and product line charges 
upon completion of the uaw labor agreement  we initiated global actions designed to address under performing operations  appropriately size our global hourly and salaried workforces and strengthen our competitive position 
as a result of those initiatives  we expect to reduce our us hourly workforce by up to  employees  the us salaried workforce by approximately employees  and our non us workforce by approximately  employees 
also in the third quarter  we received a ruling in our previously disclosed grievance proceeding with the iue cwa over certain layoffs at one of our manufacturing facilities 
the arbitrator directed us to restore the level of bargaining unit employees to  and to make the recalled employees whole 
we have filed an appeal in federal district court to preserve our rights while discussing alternative remedies with the iue cwa 
in november  we also finalized a four year labor agreement with the iue cwa  which further provides opportunities to address our employment cost reduction initiatives 
in the third quarter of  we recorded charges related to the attrition or idling of approximately  us uaw hourly employees and iue cwa hourly employees at our packard operations  both of which are included in the  discussed above  as well as approximately us salaried employees and approximately  us employees 
the balance of the planned us hourly workforce reductions will occur by the end of employees at impacted locations were informed and we communicated benefits available to them under applicable benefit plans or related contractual provisions 
also in the third quarter of  we recorded charges to make recalled employees whole at the 
table of contents iue cwa manufacturing site in accordance with the arbitration award discussed above 
the employee cost component recorded for the us hourly plans represents the accruals required by sfas no 
 employer s accounting for postemployment benefits 
such postemployment benefit accruals are based upon certain assumptions regarding the status and seniority of affected individuals  as well as the time frame and the duration of the layoffs prior to final separation 
our plans entail reductions to our workforce through a variety of methods including regular attrition and retirements  and voluntary and involuntary separations  as applicable 
under certain elements of the plans  uaw hourly employees may flowback to gm 
as required under generally accepted accounting principles  we will record the costs associated with the flowback to gm as the employees accept the offer to exit delphi 
we expect to incur total charges related to these initiatives of approximately million through december   of which million including amounts recorded in other captions was recorded in we currently expect that we will incur the remaining estimated charges of million related to these hourly employee reductions  including employee costs during periods they are idled prior to separation as well as other structural cost initiatives of million in as of december   approximately  us hourly employees of the total  us salaried employees  and  us employees have left the company pursuant to these plans 
the remaining us salaried employees left in january we expect to realize after tax savings  principally payroll and related costs  associated with these product line and employee actions of approximately million in we expect these savings to grow to approximately million on an annual basis 
as discussed above  a portion of the charges is recorded based on employee acceptance 
as a result  we have not provided forecasts of savings by sector 
we would expect that the savings will closely mirror where the charges are recorded 
in the first quarter of  delphi approved restructuring plans to eliminate approximately  positions from our global workforce  which included  us employees and  employees in us locations  downsize more than selected facilities in the united states and europe  and exit certain other activities by the end of the first quarter of the restructuring charge totaled million with million of employee costs including postemployment benefits and special termination pension benefits and million in other exit costs lease and contract cancellation fees 
this charge  when netted against a million reversal for the restructuring reserve  resulted in a net restructuring charge of million in the first quarter of the restructuring actions were completed as planned in the first quarter of total cash paid for restructuring was million  with million for employee costs and million for other exit costs 
the cash outflows for the first quarter of were million  with million for employee costs and million for other exit costs 
we have realized savings  principally payroll and related costs  of approximately million after tax associated with the restructurings ratably in all sectors

the decrease in operating income from primarily reflects the charges in excess of the charges  and is primarily due to decreases in volume  as well as increased pension  healthcare and wages  lower pricing  offset by savings realized from our restructuring plans  material cost savings  manufacturing performance and the legal settlement in connection with a commercial dispute offset by certain non recurring gains aggregating million  including the sale of property and the resolution of litigation 
the

analysis 

table of contents the first quarter restructuring plans resulted in a charge of million that included million of employee costs including postemployment benefits and special termination pension and postretirement benefits and million in other exit costs principally lease termination and contract cancellation payments 
the plans entailed the elimination of approximately  positions worldwide  comprised of  us hourly employees   us salaried employees  and  employees in non us locations 
we ultimately eliminated  positions and incurred costs of million 
for the us hourly workforce  we reduced  positions against a plan of  positions 
this shortfall occurred during the first quarter of  due to minor variances in the execution of our restructuring plans 
we eliminated  non us positions  slightly above the planned  positions  and we eliminated  us salaried employee positions as planned 
total cash paid for the first quarter restructuring plan was million  with million for employee costs and million for other exit costs 
we also had million of non cash charges  principally for special termination pension and postretirement benefits 
upon completion of our plans  in the first quarter of  we reversed million of the original million charge on the employee and product line charges line in our consolidated statements of operations 
the million is a result of the minor shortfall in head count noted previously  as well as slight favorable variances in the costs actually incurred under the various initiatives 
this reversal was netted against the restructuring charge explained above 
following is a summary of our and restructuring actions in millions employee costs other cash restructuring actions cash non cash exit costs total first quarter restructuring charge usage balance at december  adjustment due to change in estimate usage balance at december  as of december   we planned to dispose of our generator product line 
the total loss recorded in related to the planned disposal of this product line was million million after tax 
in the first quarter of  we recorded an additional loss of million million after tax  reflecting additional anticipated employee related payments  due to changes in the proposed disposition at that time 
the total recorded loss of million million after tax included a charge to depreciation and amortization of million million after tax to write down fixed assets to net realizable value  a total charge to cost of sales of million to write down inventory in the business to net realizable value  a charge to cost of sales of million for contractually required payments principally employee related  and million to write down other assets 
in july  we determined that we would not complete the transaction and began a process to wind down this product line 
however  due to the change from our original plan to sell this product line  in the second quarter of  we reclassified the generator product line as held for use from held for sale 
no additional adjustments were required as the result of the reclassification

our cash flows during the year are impacted by the volume and timing of vehicle production  which includes a halt in certain operations of our north american customers for approximately two weeks in july and one week in december and reduced production in july and august for certain european customers 
we finance our working capital through a mix of committed facilities  including receivables securitization programs  and uncommitted facilities including  bank lines  and factoring lines and to a certain extent  commercial paper 
although the latter group is not committed  we expect these facilities typically would be available to us  if and when needed 
we also maintain billion of committed credit facilities  which we have had in place since our separation from gm 
we have never used any of the billion of committed credit facilities 
we view these facilities as providing an ample source of back up liquidity that is available in case of an unanticipated event 
at december   our debt was billion  which includes billion of junior subordinated notes due to delphi trust i and ii  which are discussed below 
our capital planning process is focused on ensuring that we use our cash flow generated from our operations in ways that enhance the value of our company 
historically  we used our cash for a mix of activities focused on revenue growth  cost reduction  balance sheet strengthening and to pay dividends 
in  we used our cash primarily for balance sheet strengthening  dividends and funding our employee and product line programs  as we contributed a significant portion of our cash to our pension plans 
in  we plan to use our cash to strengthen our balance sheet  reduce costs and to continue to pay dividends at historical levels 
as part of our capital planning  we have taken into account that we currently have erisa pension funding minimums of billion over the next two years  including billion in based upon overall macro economic conditions  we could face additional erisa minimums in as discussed further in outlook us pension plans and other postretirement benefits  we currently anticipate contributing billion to our pension plans in  which results in a pre funding of billion 
in addition  we anticipate billion of product line and employee cost payments  from our restructuring programs announced in october  and billion of dividends in we expect that we will be able to fund these amounts with cash flow from operations 
we further expect that we will be able to fund our longer term requirements  including repayments of debt securities and payments for purchase options and residual value guarantees on operating leases  if exercised  as they become due 
financing activity in july  we issued unsecured notes the notes with an aggregate principal amount of million  which mature on august  we issued these notes in the anticipation of the maturity of million of year notes issued in the notes and due in may we made the decision to issue the new notes in to eliminate rollover risk and to take advantage of relatively low interest rates 
consequently  we do not anticipate a need to issue any additional long term debt in when the notes come due 
we will pay interest on the newly issued notes on february and august of each year beginning february  our next maturity of million of long term unsecured debt comes due on june   and bears interest at 
thereafter  we have million of securities bearing interest at and maturing on may   and million of securities bearing interest at and maturing on may  we issued two series of trust preferred securities in the fourth quarter of the net proceeds of billion from these issuances were immediately contributed to our us pension plans 
the details of our trust preferred securities offerings are as follows in october  delphi trust i trust i  a wholly owned subsidiary of delphi  issued  shares of cumulative trust preferred securities  with a liquidation amount of per trust preferred security and an aggregate liquidation preference amount of million 
these securities are listed on the new york stock exchange under the symbol dphpra 
the sole assets of trust i are million of aggregate principal amount of delphi junior subordinated notes 
table of contents due trust i will pay cumulative cash distributions at an annual rate equal to of the liquidation amount on the preferred securities 
in november  delphi trust ii trust ii  a wholly owned subsidiary of delphi  issued  shares of adjustable rate trust preferred securities with a five year initial rate of  a liquidation amount of  per trust preferred security and an aggregate liquidation preference amount of million 
the sole assets of trust ii are million aggregate principal amount of delphi junior subordinated notes due trust ii pays cumulative cash distributions at an annual rate equal to of the liquidation amount during the initial fixed rate period which is through november  on the preferred securities 
to increase our access to committed sources of short term financing  in november  we entered into a million million at december  currency exchange rates and million million at december  currency exchange rates trade receivable securitization program for certain of our european accounts receivable 
we intend to use this program when cost competitive 
as of december   we had no accounts receivable transferred under this program  in january  we borrowed million and million under this program  which will be recorded as short term debt 
the program expires on november  and can be extended  based upon the mutual agreement of the parties 
additionally  the european program contains financial and other covenants similar to our revolving credit facilities discussed below that  if not met  could result in a termination of the agreement 
at december   we were in compliance with all such covenants 
available credit facilities in  we renewed our day billion committed credit facility  extending its maturity from june to june we have consistently renewed this credit facility on an annual basis 
in addition  we maintain a billion year credit facility that expires june we have never borrowed under either of these credit facilities  and as of december   there were no amounts outstanding 
our credit facilities also contain certain affirmative and negative covenants including a financial covenant requirement for a debt to ebitda coverage ratio not to exceed to in addition  certain of our lease facilities discussed below contain cross default provisions to our credit facilities 
we were well within the financial covenant and in compliance with all other covenants as of december  structured financial transactions in the first quarter of  we entered into a million revolving accounts receivable securitization program in the united states us facility program 
this program has been accounted for as the sale of accounts receivable 
as of december   we had approximately million of accounts receivable sold under this program 
the us facility program expires on march  and can be extended on an annual basis for two additional day periods 
additionally  the us facility program contains financial and other covenants similar to our revolving credit facilities that  if not met  could result in a termination of the agreement 
at december   we were well within compliance with the financial covenant and all other covenants 
from time to time  certain subsidiaries may also sell receivables in the normal course of their operations 
such sales are generally consistent year to year and do not significantly impact our liquidity 
we lease certain property  primarily land and buildings that are used in our operations  under leases commonly known as synthetic leases 
these leases  which are accounted for as operating leases  provide us tax treatment equivalent to ownership  and also give us the option to purchase these properties at any time during the term or to cause the properties to be remarketed upon lease expiration 
in june  we entered into new five year leases with a bank for our corporate headquarters and two manufacturing sites 
in aggregate  our purchase price under such leases  if we choose to exercise such option  approximates million 
the leases also provide that if we do not exercise our purchase option upon expiration of the term and instead elect our remarketing option we will pay any difference between the million purchase option amount and the proceeds of remarketing  up to a maximum of approximately million 

table of contents at december   the aggregate fair value of these properties exceeds the minimum value guaranteed upon exercise of the remarketing option 
upon entering into the agreement  we recorded our estimate of the fair value of the residual value guarantee of million as a long term liability 
under the leases we also provide certain indemnities to the lessor  including environmental indemnities 
due to the nature of such potential obligations  it is not possible to estimate the maximum amount of such exposure or the fair value 
however  we do not expect such amounts  if any  to be material 
in addition  the leases contain certain covenants and cross default provisions to our credit facility  which would require us to pay the full million if we default on our obligations under the leases 
we have an additional synthetic lease  for an operation in ohio  which continues to qualify as an operating lease under generally accepted accounting principles after the adoption of financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  fin  as revised in december our purchase price option on this facility is million and we have a guaranteed residual value of million 
customer financing programs since our separation  we have maintained a program with the general electric capital corporation gecc that allowed our suppliers to factor their receivables from us to gecc for early payment 
this program also allowed us to have gecc pay our suppliers on our behalf  providing extended payment terms to us 
historically  we classified amounts factored by our suppliers but not beyond our standard supplier payment terms as accounts payable on our balance sheet 
we classified amounts beyond our standard payment terms as short term debt 
in late  we determined that all of the payables  including payables due under the normal payment terms associated with this program should be classified as debt 
as a result  our year end and short term debt balances include million and million  respectively  of accounts payable that were factored by our suppliers to gecc but of which we are still within our stated payment terms to our customer 
our year end short term debt balances also include million of payables that are beyond their standard payment terms 
there were no payables beyond their stated terms at december  some of our customers have similar arrangements with gecc  which allows us to sell certain of our customer receivables  at a discount  to gecc on a non recourse basis 
when we participate in one of these programs  our receivables are reduced and our cash balances are increased 
we did not participate in this program at december   at december   our receivables were reduced by million as a result of this program 

table of contents cash requirements the following table summarizes our expected cash outflows resulting from financial contracts and commitments 
we have not included information on our recurring purchases of materials for use in our manufacturing operations 
these amounts are generally consistent from year to year  closely reflect our levels of production  and are not long term in nature less than three months 
payments due by period total thereafter in millions debt and capital lease obligations junior subordinated notes due to delphi trust i and trust ii operating lease obligations contractual commitments for capital expenditures other contractual purchase commitments  including information technology total the amounts above exclude our minimum funding requirements as set forth by erisa  which are billion over the next two years including billion in our minimum funding requirements after are dependent on several factors 
we also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit opeb plans 
these plans are not required to be funded in advance  but are pay as you go 
see further discussion in outlook us pension plans and other postretirement benefits below 
we have no financial commitments such as lines of credit  standby lines of credit  standby repurchase obligations  or guarantees of such items to or on behalf of entities that are excluded from our consolidated financial statements 
from time to time we enter into purchase commitments with our suppliers under customary purchase order terms 
any significant losses implicit in these contracts would be recognized in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
at december   no such losses existed 
credit ratings delphi is rated by standard poor s  moody s and fitch ratings 
we currently have long term credit ratings of bbb baa bbb  respectively  and short term credit ratings of a p f  respectively  which were reviewed by the rating agencies in november our goal is to maintain solid investment grade credit ratings 
although not currently anticipated  if we were downgraded by moody s to baa  our facility fee and borrowing costs under our existing five year credit facility would increase  although availability would be unaffected 
however  we currently have no amounts outstanding under such facilities and do not expect that we will need to draw on these facilities even in the event of such a downgrade 
in the event of a further downgrade to bb baa bbb  we believe we would continue to have access to sufficient liquidity  however  our cost of borrowing would further increase and our ability to tap certain financial markets may be limited 

table of contents capital expenditures our capital expenditure program promotes our growth oriented business strategy by investing in existing core areas  where efficiencies and profitability can be enhanced  and by targeting funds for new innovative technologies  where long term growth opportunities can be realized 
capital expenditures by product sector and geographic region for the periods presented were year ended december  in millions dynamics  propulsion thermal electrical  electronics  safety interior automotive holdings group other total capital expenditures north america europe  middle east africa asia pacific south america total capital expenditures as of december   delphi had approximately million in outstanding capital commitments 
we expect capital expenditures to be approximately billion in we currently expect approximately of our capital expenditures to occur outside north america 
cash flows operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities totaled billion for the year ended december   compared to billion in and billion in net cash provided by operating activities in was impacted by contributions to our us pension plans of billion and cash paid for employee and product line initiatives and lump sum contract signing bonuses totaling approximately million 
sales under our new accounts receivable us facility agreement effectively replaced sales under another program  which permitted us to sell certain accounts receivable on a non recourse basis 
as a result  the new facility agreement did not have a significant impact on our cash flow from operations 
net cash provided by operating activities in was impacted by a million contribution to our us pension plans and a million second quarter payment to gm for previously recorded separation related obligations for other postretirement benefits 
net cash provided by operating activities in resulted from improved working capital management partially offset by a million payment to gm for previously recorded separation related obligations 
investing activities 
cash flows used in investing activities totaled billion for both years ended december  and  and billion for the year ended december  the principal use of cash in  and reflects capital expenditures related to ongoing operations 
additionally  in  we acquired grundig car intermedia system gmbh for approximately million  net of cash acquired  and in  we acquired delphi mechatronic systems and delphi connections systems specialty electronics for an aggregate of approximately billion 
financing activities 
during  our financing activity resulted in cash proceeds of million from the debt and trust preferred issuances discussed above 
in addition  we repaid approximately million of short term debt and paid million of dividends 
cash used in financing activities during represented repayment of commercial paper and dividend and treasury stock purchases partially offset by increased borrowings of short term debt 
cash provided by financing activities for includes the net proceeds from a million public debt offering offset by repayments under our commercial paper program 

table of contents dividends 
the delphi board of directors declared a dividend on delphi common stock of per share on march  june  september  and december   which were paid on may  july  october  and january   respectively 
stock repurchase program 
the board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to million shares of delphi common stock to fund stock options and other employee benefit plans 
we did not repurchase any shares during we repurchased approximately million shares in the open market during and  to offset the effect of shares issued under those plans and to provide for a more consistent number of shares outstanding 
outlook general 
consistent with the automotive supply industry generally  we continue to experience significant competitive pressure and expect to face continued downward cost expectations from vehicle manufacturers 
however  our non gm revenue is expected to grow 
it grew by during  and represents of our sales  up from in the same period last year 
we expect compounded annual non gm revenue growth of at least on a constant exchange rate basis over time 
driven by an outlook for strong non gm sales growth  and assisted by restructuring and other cost reduction activities  we expect our first quarter sales to be in the range of billion to billion  in line with or slightly higher than our first quarter sales of billion 
on a year over year basis  currency exchange rates  principally the appreciation of the euro  is expected to add million to revenue 
we expect first quarter net income will be in the range of million to million  including expected employee and product line charges under programs announced in october of to million 
in december  we indicated that we expect sales to be in the range of billion to billion and our net income to be in the range of million to million  excluding any employee and product line charges under our october programs 
delphi continues to implement productivity improvements and streamline activities designed to reduce overhead and improve manufacturing processes 
in addition  we continue to streamline our portfolio  reduce excess capacity and operating costs  and respond to global industry conditions and increased employee related costs such as us health care and pensions as well as wages in non us locations 
we anticipate significant flowback of uaw represented delphi employees to gm and are currently negotiating a competitive new hire wage and benefit agreement with the uaw 
ahg is designed to provide a better environment for all of our stakeholders 
each of the product lines and sites within ahg has its own unique set of challenges that require us to be flexible and creative in our ongoing efforts to find solutions 
we are engaged in dialogue with the uaw regarding our plans for consolidation of three ahg sites olathe  kansas  tuscaloosa  alabama  and flint west  michigan 
an agreement is in place with the iue cwa to source a certain product line in our anaheim  california facility  presently part of ahg  to another facility 
in addition to conditions in our market and the economy as a whole  we depend on gm as a customer 
gm accounted for of our net sales for our sales to gm have declined since our separation from gm  principally due to lower gm production  the impact of customer driven price reductions and the elimination of non profitable businesses  as well as gm s diversification of its supply base and ongoing changes in our vehicle content and the product mix supplied to them 
we continue to exit some businesses as part of our portfolio review process 
reflecting these and other factors  we expect our sales to gm to decline over time 
if we are unable to compete effectively for new business with gm s other suppliers  our revenues may decline further 
in the fourth quarter of  delphi and gm reached an agreement on a growth and opportunity process that provides for advanced review of sourcing opportunities  which should stabilize business at delphi s us legacy sites 
while we intend to continue to focus on retaining and winning gm s business  we cannot ensure that we will succeed in doing so 
additionally  our revenues may be affected by increases or decreases in gm s business or market share as well as cost reduction initiatives 
our gm north america content per vehicle for was  which was slightly higher than the previously expected content per vehicle of  we anticipate that our 
table of contents content per vehicle will be  we continue to project our sales beyond to grow modestly assuming projected production levels  with non gm sales increasing and gm sales decreasing 
we face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability and warranty claims in the event that our products fail to perform as expected and such failure of our products results  or is alleged to result  in bodily injury and or property damage 
in addition  as we actively pursue additional technological innovation in both automotive and non automotive industries and enhance the value of our intellectual property portfolio  we incur ongoing costs to enforce and defend our intellectual property and face an inherent risk of exposure to the claims of other suppliers and parties that we have allegedly violated their intellectual property rights 
we cannot ensure that we will not experience any material warranty  product liability or intellectual property claim losses in the future or that we will not incur significant costs to defend such claims 
in addition  if any of our products are or are alleged to be defective  we may be required to participate in a recall involving such products 
each vehicle manufacturer has its own practices regarding product recalls and other product liability actions relating to its suppliers 
however  as suppliers become more integrally involved in the vehicle design process and assume more of the vehicle assembly functions  vehicle manufacturers are increasingly looking to their suppliers for contribution when faced with recalls and product liability claims 
a recall claim brought against us  or a product liability claim brought against us in excess of our available insurance  may have a material adverse effect on our business 
vehicle manufacturers are also increasingly requiring their outside suppliers to guarantee or warrant their products and bear the costs of repair and replacement of such products under new vehicle warranties 
depending on the terms under which we supply products to a vehicle manufacturer  a vehicle manufacturer may attempt to hold us responsible for some or all of the repair or replacement costs of defective products under new vehicle warranties  when the product supplied did not perform as represented 
accordingly  although we cannot ensure that the future costs of warranty claims by our customers will not be material  we believe our established reserves are adequate to cover potential warranty settlements 
our warranty reserves are based upon our best estimates of amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims 
we regularly evaluate the level of these reserves  and adjust them when appropriate 
however  the final amounts determined to be due related to these matters could differ materially from our recorded estimates 
us pension plans and other postretirement benefits 
delphi sponsors defined benefit pension plans covering a significant percentage of our us workforce and certain of our us workforce 
on december   the projected benefit obligation pbo exceeded the market value of the plan assets by billion  compared to billion at december   the decrease is explained as follows underfunded status pbo basis in billions december  pension contributions asset returns impact of discount rate decrease by basis points to contract impact interest and service cost other december  while the recent interest rate and asset return environment has significantly impacted the funded status of our plans  delphi did not have minimum funding requirements  as set forth in the employee benefit and tax laws  during our minimum funding requirement of approximately billion is less than our planned contribution of billion 
while contributions subsequent to are dependent on asset returns and a number of other factors  if we make contributions of billion in  we will be required by employee benefit and tax laws to make contributions of approximately billion in  assuming that the contributions are made prior to june each year  and approximately 
table of contents billion in these contribution estimates assume new legislation related to the funding discount rate will be passed in to modify the rules that expired during if the legislation is not passed  it is likely that delphi s minimum funding requirements  as set forth in employee benefit and tax laws  for and could increase by up to billion per year 
the discount rate that we utilize for determining future pension obligations is based on a review of long term bonds  including published indices  which receive one of the two highest ratings given by recognized rating agencies 
the discount rate determined on that basis decreased from for to for this basis point decline in the discount rate had the effect of increasing the underfunded status of our us pension plans by approximately billion 
for  delphi assumed a long term asset rate of return of 
we will also utilize a long term asset rate of return assumption in in developing the expected long term rate of return assumption  we evaluated input from our third party pension plan asset managers  including a review of asset class return expectations and long term inflation assumptions 
we also considered delphi s post spin off and gm s pre spin off historical year compounded return period ended december   which was in line with our long term rate of return assumption 
the long term asset return assumption for is based on an asset allocation assumption of with us and international equity managers  with fixed income managers  and with other asset managers primarily real estate 
delphi s asset managers regularly review the actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance our investments to our targeted allocation when considered appropriate 
at december   our actual asset allocation was consistent with our asset allocation assumption 
we base our determination of the asset return component of pension expense on a market related valuation of assets  which reduces year to year volatility 
this market related valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a five year period from the year in which they occur 
investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market related value of assets and the actual return based on the market related value of assets 
since the market related value of assets recognizes gains or losses over a five year period  the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recorded 
as of december   we had cumulative asset losses of approximately billion  which remain to be recognized in the calculation of the market related value of assets 
the declining interest rate environment and varying asset returns versus expectations in  and resulted in an accumulated actuarial loss of billion at december  of this amount  billion represents the deferred market value of assets adjustment and is not considered when determining pension expense 
in accordance with pension accounting rules  an additional billion is excluded when determining pension expense 
the remaining actuarial loss of billion at december  is amortized over the remaining service life of our pension plan participants 
our expense related to actuarial losses in will be approximately million higher than in delphi s us pension expense was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
for  we expect pension expense to exceed pension expense by approximately billion 
most of the increase relates to the new labor contract  with the basis point bp decline in the discount rate offset by favorable assets returns and other factors including contributions 
these increases include the impact of the amortization of actuarial losses mentioned above 
as required by accounting rules  our pension expense for is determined at the end of december however  for 
table of contents purposes of analysis  the following table highlights the sensitivity of our pension obligations and expense to changes in assumptions impact on pension change in assumption expense impact on pbo bp decrease in discount rate to million billion bp increase in discount rate to million billion bp decrease in long term return on assets to million bp increase in long term return on assets to million pension accounting rules also require us to record a charge to stockholders equity when certain conditions are met 
as of december   our charge to stockholders equity was  million  which was substantially the same as last year s charge to stockholders equity of  million 
in addition  we maintain postretirement benefit plans other than pensions that are not funded 
at december  and  the amount reflected in our consolidated balance sheet for other postretirement benefit obligations were billion and billion  respectively 
these plans do not have minimum funding requirements  but rather are pay as you go 
as we currently have retirees for each active employee  the cash costs that we incur are lower than the actual expenses 
during  we incurred approximately million of cash costs including approximately million of payments to gm for certain of our former employees that flowed back to gm and had actuarially been determined to retire and million of expense in related to these plans 
a one percentage point increase in the assumed long term health care trend rate would increase the aggregate service and interest cost components of the annual other postretirement benefit expense by approximately million  and would have increased the related accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by billion 
a one percentage point decrease in the assumed health care trend rate would have decreased the aggregate service and interest cost components of other postretirement benefit expense by approximately million  and would have decreased the related accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by billion 
on december   president bush signed the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act into law 
this law provides for a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to the benefit established by the law 
the federal subsidy included in the law results in a billion reduction in our opeb benefit obligation 
however  the reduction is not reflected in our consolidated financial statements  because we use a september  measurement date 
for  we expect a net increase in our opeb expense when compared to this increase reflects the favorable impact of the medicare legislation offset by a basis point decline in the discount rate and a change in our health care trend rate 
specific authoritative guidance  when issued by the fasb  could require us to re determine the impact of this legislation 
delphi provides retiree drug benefits that exceed the value of the benefits that will be provided by medicare part d  and delphi s retirees pay a premium for this benefit that is less than the part d premium 
therefore delphi has concluded that these benefits are at least actuarially equivalent to the part d program so that delphi will be eligible for the basic medicare part d subsidy 
inflation inflation generally affects delphi by increasing the cost of labor  equipment and raw materials 
we believe that  because rates of inflation in countries where we have significant operations have been moderate during the periods presented  inflation has not had a significant impact on our results of operations 
deferred income taxes as more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements  at december   delphi s consolidated balance sheet included a net deferred tax asset of approximately billion 
this net deferred tax asset relates to temporary differences between amounts of assets and liabilities for 
table of contents financial reporting purposes and the basis of such assets and liabilities as measured by tax laws 
components of this net deferred tax asset are subject to revaluation upwards or downwards if enacted tax rates expected to be applicable to the reversal of such temporary differences are increased or decreased 
legislation currently pending in the us congress could have the effect of reducing the tax rate applicable to certain portions of our income and  accordingly  could cause a reduction in the value of certain deferred tax assets 
the amount of this reduction  if any  cannot be quantified until the legislation is enacted and the tax and accounting rules applicable thereto are clarified 
approximately billion of the net deferred tax asset balance is related to our obligations for postretirement and pension benefits and approximately billion  net of valuation allowance  is related to net operating loss carryforwards 
substantially all of the net deferred tax asset balance is with respect to us federal and state income taxes on such temporary differences 
realization of the net deferred tax asset is dependent upon profitable operations in the united states and certain other countries and future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences 
although realization is not assured  we believe that it is more likely than not that such benefits will be realized through the reduction of future taxable income 
management has considered various factors in assessing the probability of realizing these deferred tax assets including delphi s operating results  excluding the impact of special items  over the most recent three year period and overall financial forecasts of book and taxable income for the period 
the ability to utilize tax planning  such as capitalization of research and experimentation costs for tax purposes  to manage the degree to which delphi generates significant us federal tax net operating losses 
the extended period of time over which the tax assets can be utilized 
postretirement benefits become tax deductions over periods up to years 
in addition to valuation allowances with respect to certain non us net operating loss carryforwards  we have recorded valuation allowances with respect to certain us federal short lived carryforwards eg capital loss  contribution and foreign tax credit carryforwards but have not recorded valuation allowances with respect to us federal long lived carryforwards eg net operating loss and general business credit carryforwards 
environmental matters we are subject to the requirements of us federal  state  local and non us environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations 
these include laws regulating air emissions  water discharge and waste management 
we have an environmental management structure designed to facilitate and support our compliance with these requirements globally 
although it is our intent to comply with all such requirements and regulations  we cannot provide assurance that we are at all times in compliance 
we have made and will continue to make capital and other expenditures to comply with environmental requirements  although such expenditures were not material during the past three years and we do not expect such expenditures to be material in environmental requirements are complex  change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time 
accordingly  we cannot ensure that environmental requirements will not change or become more stringent over time or that our eventual environmental cleanup costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of our current reserves

table of contents significant accounting policies and critical accounting estimates our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
certain of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
these judgments are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  our evaluation of trends in the industry  information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires us to make assumptions about matters that were uncertain at the time we were making the estimate  and changes in the estimate or different estimates that we could have selected would have had a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
the table below presents information about the nature and rationale for delphi s critical accounting estimates nature of estimates assumptions approaches balance sheet caption critical estimate item required used key factors accrued liabilities and other long term liabilities warranty obligations estimating warranty requires us to forecast the resolution of existing claims and expected future claims on products sold 
vms are increasingly seeking to hold suppliers responsible for product warranties  which may impact our exposure to these costs

table of contents nature of estimates assumptions approaches balance sheet caption critical estimate item required used key factors pension and other postretirement benefits pension and other postretirement benefits in calculating our obligation and expense  we are required to select certain actuarial assumptions  as more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
these assumptions include discount rate  expected long term rate of return on plan assets and rates of increase in compensation and healthcare costs

future production estimates customer preferences and decisions deferred income taxes recoverability of deferred tax assets in particular  net operating loss carryforwards we are required to estimate whether recoverability of our deferred tax assets is more likely than not based on forecasts of taxable earnings in the related tax jurisdiction 
we use historical and projected future operating results  based upon approved business plans  including a review of the eligible carryforward period  tax planning opportunities and other relevant considerations 
tax law changes variances in future projected profitability  including by taxing entity in addition  there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation  but are not as critical as those discussed above 
these include the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable and reserves for excess and obsolete inventory 
although not significant in recent years  changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a significant effect on our consolidated financial statements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s we are exposed to market risks from changes in currency exchange rates and certain commodity prices 
in order to manage these risks  we operate a centralized hedging program that consists of entering into a variety of derivative contracts with the intent of mitigating our risk to fluctuations in currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
a discussion of our accounting policies for derivative instruments is included in note to our consolidated financial statements and further disclosure is provided in note to those consolidated financial statements 
we maintain risk management control systems to monitor exchange and commodity risks  and related hedge positions 
positions are monitored using a variety of analytical techniques including market value and sensitivity analysis 
the following analyses are based on sensitivity tests  which assume instantaneous  parallel shifts in currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
for options and instruments with non linear returns  appropriate models are utilized to determine the impact of shifts in rates and prices 
currency exchange rate risk we have currency exposures related to buying  selling and financing in currencies other than the local currency in which we operate 
these exposures may impact future earnings and or operating cash flows 
in some instances  we choose to reduce our exposures through financial instruments hedges that provide offsets or limits to our exposures  which are opposite to the underlying transactions 
currently  our most significant currency exposures relate to the mexican peso  polish zloty  chinese yuan  hungarian forint  singapore dollar  canadian dollar  japanese yen  and euro 
as of december  and  the net 
table of contents fair value asset of all financial instruments with exposure to currency risk was approximately million and million  respectively 
the potential loss in fair value for such financial instruments from a hypothetical adverse change in quoted currency exchange rates would be approximately million at december  and million at december  the potential gain in fair value for such financial instruments from a hypothetical favorable change in quoted currency exchange rates would be approximately million at december  and million at december  the impact of a change in rates on fair value differs from a change in the net fair value asset due to the existence of hedges 
the model assumes a parallel shift in currency exchange rates  however  currency exchange rates rarely move in the same direction 
the assumption that currency exchange rates change in a parallel fashion may overstate the impact of changing currency exchange rates on assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
commodity price risk commodity swaps and option contracts are executed to offset our exposure to the potential change in prices mainly for various non ferrous metals used in the manufacturing of automotive components 
the net fair value of our contracts was an asset of approximately million and a liability of million at december  and december   respectively 
if the price of the commodities that are being protected by our commodity swaps and options contracts changed adversely by  the december  fair value assets of our commodity swaps and options contracts would decrease by million to million  and the december  fair value liability would increase million to million 
if the price of the commodities that are being protected by our commodity swaps and options contracts changed favorably by  the fair value of our commodity swaps and options contracts would increase by million and the december  fair value would decrease by million 
the changes in the net fair value liability differ from of those balances due to the relative differences between the underlying commodity prices and the prices in place in our commodity swaps and options contracts 
these amounts exclude the offsetting impact of the price risk inherent in the physical purchase of the underlying commodities 
interest rate risk a portion of our borrowings from third party credit sources is comprised of billion in fixed rate term debt and junior subordinated notes underlying our trust preferred securities 
we also issue commercial paper and factor accounts receivable in the us  europe  and asia 
our outstanding commercial paper balance was billion at december  and decreased to billion at december  the maturities on commercial paper have been short term with the majority maturing within one month 
when commercial paper matures  it may be re issued at the then current market rate 
in addition  factoring programs fees are based upon an interest rate component 
however  given our reliance on fixed rate borrowings to fund long term requirements  we believe our interest rate risk exposure is limited and accordingly  we do not have any outstanding derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk as of december
