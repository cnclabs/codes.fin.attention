overview our products and facilities we are a domestic producer of seamless and welded tubular steel products serving the energy industry 
we conduct our business within a single reportable business segment  which we refer to as the energy products segment 
our tubular products  commonly referred to as oil country tubular goods octg  are used primarily in oil and natural gas drilling exploration and production operations 
we also manufacture line pipe  which is used as gathering lines for the transmission of petrochemicals and hydrocarbons 
our products are manufactured and sold under two brands 
our koppel brand is our seamless tubular product manufactured at our facility located near koppel  pennsylvania 
our newport brand is our welded tubular product manufactured at our tubular facilities located near newport  kentucky 
the primary geographic market for our products is the southwestern and appalachian regions of the united states and western regions of canada 
we also operate tubular finishing facilities in the southwest united states  where we can provide further finishing processes to our product 
restructuring of operations during the quarter ended march   we implemented restructuring initiatives designed to give us a lower  more flexible cost structure 
one initiative was to purchase hot rolled coils rather than manufacture them at our welded tubular operations 
as a result  we closed the melt shop and hot strip mill operations at our welded tubular facilities in wilder  kentucky effective march  in addition  we decided to cease the manufacturing of special bar quality products which we refer to as sbq  which were being manufactured at our koppel  pennsylvania facility 
in the march quarter  we recorded total restructuring charges of million  including million of charges resulting primarily from the write down of fixed assets and million recorded to cost of products sold related to inventories 
the closures resulted in total workforce reductions of approximately positions at the welded tubular operations in wilder  kentucky and the sbq products operations in koppel  pennsylvania 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded million of additional restructuring charges related to the march restructuring 
the charges included a million impairment loss on the assets being held for sale and million primarily related to an increase in our estimate of post closure costs for our closed landfill 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded million of additional restructuring charges resulting from an increase in the estimated cancellation costs of operating contracts through june   we conducted our business within two reportable business segments the energy products segment and the industrial products segment 
in june  we exited the sbq business that comprised our industrial products segment 
since that time  we have conducted our operations solely within the energy products segment 
our industrial products segment consisted solely of special bar quality products used in a variety of industrial applications such as farm equipment  heavy machinery  construction and off road vehicles 
you should read note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information pertaining to segment data 
economic and industry wide factors that affect our business demand for our products over of our revenues are derived from the sale of octg 
therefore  our revenue is directly dependent on the demand for octg  which is highly cyclical in nature 
there are a number of factors that we monitor to assist us in estimating the future demand for our octg product 
demand for our octg products is dependent on the number and depth of oil and natural gas wells being drilled in the united states and globally 
the level of drilling activity is  among other things  dependent on the current and anticipated supply and demand for oil and natural gas 
oil and natural gas prices are volatile and can have a substantial effect upon drilling levels and resulting demand for our energy related products 
in addition  shipments by domestic producers of octg products may be positively or negatively affected by the amount of inventory held by producers  distributors and end users  as well as by imports of octg products 
the average number of oil and gas drilling rigs operating in the united states rig count  domestic shipments of octg products excluding exports  domestic octg inventories and imports of octg products for  and were as follows average us drill rig count   octg shipments millions of tons octg imports millions of tons octg inventories millions of tons at year end inventory tons per rig at year end    source baker hughes  preston pipe and tube report and company estimates in response to strong oil and natural gas prices  rig count rose steadily throughout the first half of  reaching a high of  in july however  natural gas prices began to fall as the slowdown in the economy  milder weather and fuel switching resulted in strong injection rates into natural gas storage during the summer months of the weak economy and mild weather in the latter part of resulted in historically high levels of natural gas storage going into consequently  rig count in fell from and demand for our octg products fell for the comparable periods as well 
natural gas prices rose steadily in the second half of and into due to low drilling levels during and increased demand for natural gas 
driven primarily by the winter weather of these factors  together with an improving us economy  particularly in the second half of  resulted in an increase in the rig count of over based upon current settlement prices for natural gas futures  economists forecasts of approximately real gdp growth in  as well as other factors  we estimate the rig count will average  in the rig count as of march  was levels of octg inventories in the marketplace are also an indicator of future demand 
us end users obtain octg from domestic and foreign tubular producers and from draw downs of inventory from the end user  distributor or tubular producers 
we believe the level of inventory per rig at december  will result in incremental demand for octg in from the need to increase inventories 
imports imports command a significant portion of the domestic octg market 
we believe import levels are affected by  among other things currency exchange rates overall world demand for octg  the trade practices of foreign governments and producers  and the presence or absence of antidumping countervailing duty or other us government orders that raise the cost or impose limits on imports 
according to published industry reports  imports of octg products in comprised an estimated of the total domestic market  compared to in and in in late  the united states international trade commission itc reported injury from various imported steel products under section and recommended to the president a wide scale program of quotas and duties 
however  the itc recommendation for quotas and duties did not include imports of octg products 
in response  we  together with other domestic oil country tubular goods producers  sought relief from unfair trade by filing petitions with the itc against certain countries 
in may  the itc voted against our suit and the case was terminated 
since  the us government has been imposing duties on imports of various octg products from argentina  italy  japan  korea and mexico in response to antidumping and countervailing duty cases filed by several us companies 
in june  the itc voted to continue these duties for five more years 
under the us continued dumping and subsidy offset act cdsoa  tariffs collected on dumped imports are required to be directed to the industries harmed 
these payments are made to cover certain operating expenses and investment in manufacturing facilities 
in september  the world trade organization wto ruled that such payments violate international trade rules 
the us trade representative appealed this ruling  however  the wto upheld the ruling in january we received million in cdsoa payments in we may not receive payments under the cdsoa in or any years thereafter  and we cannot predict the amount of any such payments 
we cannot predict the us government s future actions regarding duties and tariffs or any other future actions regarding import duties or other trade restrictions on imports of octg and line pipe products 
we expect to continue to experience high levels of competition from imports 
costs of our products as a manufacturer of tubular steel products  the costs of our products include steel raw material costs  direct and indirect labor  energy costs and other direct and indirect manufacturing costs 
we have followed a strategy of being a low cost  quality producer of energy tubular products by focusing on reducing fixed costs  lowering our variable conversion costs by applying continuous process improvement measures within our manufacturing processes  and raw material cost management 
for example  our restructuring initiatives gave us a lower  more flexible cost structure for our welded products 
also  in we implemented various process improvement measures that enabled us to reduce our variable conversion costs per ton through most of our key operations 
the primary raw material used in our seamless operations is steel scrap  which represents approximately of cost of goods sold for our seamless products 
at our welded facility  purchased steel coil is the primary raw material  which represents approximately of cost of goods sold for our welded products 
as a result  the steel industry  which is highly cyclical and volatile in nature  can affect our costs both positively and negatively 
various factors  most of which are beyond our control  affect the price of steel scrap and coils 
these factors include supply and demand factors  both domestic and global  freight costs and transportation availability  inventory levels of brokers and distributors  the level of imports and exports  and  general economic conditions 
increases in our steel costs adversely affect our financial results if we are not able to successfully raise the price of our products to compensate 
in  purchased scrap costs  which affect the cost of our seamless products  increased approximately per ton from purchased steel coil costs  which affect the cost of our welded products  increased approximately per ton from our average revenue per ton  adjusted for mix  was virtually unchanged for our seamless products and increased approximately per ton for our welded products compared to the effects of inflation did not have a material effect on our results of operations in  and recent developments a number of economic and steel industry related factors have combined to result in significant increases in the cost of steel scrap and hot rolled coils beginning late in the fourth quarter of strong us and international economic growth  led by china  has significantly increased demand for steel scrap 
demand by foreign countries and the fall in the value of the us dollar have resulted in the highest level of us exports of steel scrap since in addition  export restrictions placed on steel scrap by certain foreign countries has reduced worldwide supply 
finally  there are seasonal constraints on the north american scrap supply due to the negative effect winter weather has on collecting and transporting steel scrap 
as a result  we estimate our first quarter purchased steel scrap cost will increase by over per ton  nearly double our average purchased steel scrap cost for the increase in steel scrap costs has resulted in an increase in hot rolled coil costs used in the manufacture of our welded tubular products 
steel coils are similarly in high demand as a result of strong global economic growth 
us supply has also been reduced due to the lack of imports  which has occurred for several reasons  including i the fall in the value of the us dollar  ii the high cost of ocean freight transportation  and iii a delay in the effect of the lifting of section tariffs on steel coils  which occurred in december in addition  there are industry specific factors affecting steel coil supply such as a tight supply of raw materials for integrated steel companies and selected outages within the steel industry 
these factors have resulted in the imposition of steel surcharges and base price increases from steel suppliers to all steel consuming industries  including our industry 
as a result of these factors  we estimate our first quarter purchased steel coil costs will increase by over per ton from our average purchased steel coil cost in current quotes for april reflect an additional cost of per ton over our first quarter estimate 
to date  the octg industry has been passing these increases in steel costs through to its customers in the form of base price increases as well as steel surcharges 
these surcharges have essentially matched surcharges imposed by steel coil producers  as they attempt to recover increases in their steel raw material costs 
in addition to significantly higher steel prices  buyers of steel products  including the octg industry  are experiencing extended lead times on delivery of products and instances of cancellation of steel purchase orders 
while our customers are currently placing orders at higher prices  thus compensating us for increases in our raw material costs  there can be no assurance that our customers will continue to pay higher prices for our tubular products  and that raw material supply will be consistently available to meet our customer demand 
if either of these factors were to occur  we may have to curtail or suspend operations for an unknown period of time

included in the results was million of cash receipts from a favorable claim settlement  which reduced the loss by per diluted share 
results for included million of restructuring charges  which increased the loss by per diluted share 
energy products our net sales in increased over primarily as a result of an increase in our energy product shipments 
the increase in shipments was caused by higher consumption of octg products in light of increased drilling activity in changes in our average revenue per ton were not significant and primarily price driven 
prices in were suppressed as us and foreign producers competed for the increase in energy tubular product demand 
our gross loss was reduced by million from due to a number of factors  including  but not limited to a higher absorption of fixed costs due to the significantly higher operating levels in  lower variable conversion costs per ton  lower fixed costs  and increased revenue per ton for welded products 
in  we implemented management process changes to reduce spending and improve prime yield and productivity measures throughout all of our major operations 
as a result of these efforts  we estimate that we reduced our variable conversion costs in our major operations by to  depending on the operation 
we also reduced our manufacturing fixed costs in due to lower wage and fringe costs associated with a reduction in salaried personnel as well as other cost reduction measures 
depreciation expense declined by million from as a result of the machinery and equipment placed in service in for the opening of our seamless operations becoming fully depreciated 
these factors were partially offset by higher purchased steel scrap and coil costs of approximately and  respectively 
selling  general and administrative expenses in were lower by million compared to contributing factors included a reduction in wages and fringe costs associated with a reduction in salaried personnel and a decrease in discretionary spending  primarily pertaining to professional consulting fees for various project work

results for included restructuring charges which increased the net loss by million  or per diluted share 
energy products energy products segment sales of million in were million  or  less than the million reported for product shipments of  tons in were  tons  or  less than the  tons in the significant decreases in sales and shipments were experienced by both our seamless and welded products 
the decrease in shipments was a direct result of the lower rig count in also  distributors lowered their inventories in  which further negatively impacted our shipments 
in addition  the level of imports negatively impacted our shipments of octg products 
the average revenue per ton for our welded tubular products was per ton  a decrease of from the average revenue per ton for our seamless tubular products was per ton  a decrease of from the decreases in average revenue per ton were due primarily to the weak market conditions in the energy product segment reported a gross loss of million and an operating loss of million in  which includes million of restructuring charges 
in the segment reported a gross profit of million and operating loss of million  which includes million of restructuring charges 
the decline in gross profit from was primarily the result of the significant decline in shipments  lower pricing for our products and an increase in purchased steel costs 
in addition  due to lower operating levels in  our margins were negatively impacted due to lower fixed cost absorption 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the energy product segment in decreased million  or  from primarily as a result of reduced employee and related costs due to the restructuring  as well as general cost reduction efforts implemented in industrial products sbq as mentioned previously  the industrial products sbq segment was closed in june the segment recorded sales of million  gross losses of million and operating losses of million in the first six months of included in the operating losses for are million of restructuring charges

investment income  interest expense  other income our net investment loss was million in  compared to income of million in and a loss of million in impairment losses on long term investments were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
interest income before impairment losses decreased in and because of lower invested balances as we liquidated our investments to pay down our senior notes and fund operating losses 
interest income was also lower due to by declining interest rates paid on investments 
during and  we reduced our interest expense by paying down our senior notes by million in july and retiring the remaining principal balance of million in the second quarter of the senior note retirements were funded from existing cash and investment balances and borrowings under our credit facility 
other income net  for  and includes million  million and million  respectively  of cash receipts from favorable claim settlements with electrode suppliers relating to purchases in prior years 
we do not anticipate any additional material receipts related to this issue 
income taxes we exhausted our federal income tax refund capability in fiscal  and as such  tax benefits from operating losses are offset by valuation allowances resulting in no net federal tax benefit being recorded for losses 
the million tax benefit recorded in resulted from reclassifying to income the deferred tax benefits related to our long term investments that were sold in the million tax benefit recorded in resulted primarily from refund claims filed in connection with newly enacted federal income tax law changes 
the tax benefit of million recorded in resulted primarily from state income tax benefits associated with the restructuring charges and the investment impairment losses 
liquidity and capital resources overview our principal sources of liquidity have historically included cash flow from operating activities  our revolving credit facilities and other sources of financing through the capital markets 
our business is highly cyclical in nature  and therefore our cash flows from operating activities can vary significantly 
for example  cash flows from operating activities provided million in  however  they used million and million in and  respectively 
we consider working capital items such as accounts receivable  inventory  accounts payable and accrued liabilities as critical components to managing our liquidity 
our capital expenditures have totaled million over the past three years and have not been a significant liquidity requirement in any one year 
we have limited our capital spending in the past three years primarily to non discretionary spending 
we may adjust our capital spending upward as market conditions and financial results allow 
in the past three years  we have spent million to retire the remaining principal portion of our senior notes 
we funded these retirements principally from existing cash and investment balances as well as borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
as of december   we have cash and equivalents of million 
we are currently dependent on cash flows from operations and our credit facility to fund our working capital needs 
cash requirements the following table summarizes our expected cash outflows resulting from contractual obligations and our commerical commitments under our revolving credit facility 
we have not included information on our recurring purchases of materials for use in our manufacturing operations 
these amounts closely reflect our levels of production and are not long term in nature less than three months 
certain obligations are described more fully in of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
payments due by period less than more than in thousands total year years years years other notes payable long term debt operating leases restructuring liabilities    employee benefit plans     total      amount of commitment expirations by period less than more than in thousands total year years years years revolving credit facility   we have a million revolving credit facility that expires in march as of december   we had a balance of million outstanding under the credit facility 
we also had outstanding letters of credit in the amount of million  reducing the amount of funds available under the credit facility to approximately million as of december  see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
the amount due in less than one year for restructuring liabilities includes our estimate of contract cancellation costs  including those in dispute 
therefore  the ultimate amount and timing of such payments could differ from the amounts and timing reflected in the table 
we currently purchase electricity for our seamless facility pursuant to long term contracts 
amounts paid under these contracts are not included in the table because they can vary significantly based on the level of our operations 
we paid million  million and million to our electricity providers in  and  respectively 
we are subject to various claims  lawsuits and administrative proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business with respect to environmental matters  workers compensation  health care and product liability each of which is self insured to certain levels as well as commercial and other matters 
we accrue for the cost of such matters when the incurrence of such costs is probable and can be reasonably estimated 
in we increased our reserves for warranty claims by million for new claims and changes in estimates of existing claims 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of product warranty claims 
while the ultimate amount and timing of payment for loss contingencies can be difficult to determine  we do not believe that such amounts and the timing of payment will result in a material adverse affect on our cash flows 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a description of accrued liabilities 
in october  we entered into a contract to sell a significant portion of our assets held for sale 
in accordance with the contract  payments of million are scheduled to be received over the first six months of based upon our current market outlook  we believe income from operations will improve in due to increased revenues  resulting from both increased shipments and pricing  as well as further reductions in our conversion costs 
as such  we believe cash flows from operations  together with our credit facility and other sources  including the capital markets  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements 
working capital working capital at december  was million compared to million at december   and the ratio of current assets to current liabilities at december  was to compared to to at december  the working capital increase was primarily due to increases in accounts receivable and inventories in excess of increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities  resulting from a substantial increase in business activity and shipment volumes 
we also used existing cash balances and borrowings under our credit facility to repay million of our long term debt and to fund operating losses in at december  we had cash totaling million compared to cash and investments of million at december  our credit facility borrowings at december  were million 
operating cash flows cash used by operating activities in was million 
this use of cash was primarily the result of an operating loss of million  which included depreciation and amortization charges of million 
in addition  changes in our operating assets and liabilities resulted in a use of cash of million in major components of these changes included a million increase in accounts receivable and a million increase in inventories  partially offset by increases of million and million in accounts payable and accrued liabilities  respectively 
the increase in our accounts receivable balance was the result of higher sales in the fourth quarter of as compared to sales in the fourth quarter of the increase in inventories and accounts payable was the result of increased business levels and incremental investments made in anticipation of raw material cost increases 
accrued liabilities increased principally as the result of a million increase in deferred revenue resulting from the higher level of business activity 
we made million in interest payments in  or million less than we paid in  due to the payoff of our senior secured notes in operating cash flows in included cash receipts of million related to antitrust litigation against manufacturers of graphite electrodes used in the steel making process 
cash used by operating activities in was million 
this use of cash was primarily the result of an operating loss of million  which included depreciation and amortization charges of million 
changes in our operating assets and liabilities generated million in cash in major components of these changes in included a decrease in accounts receivable and accounts payable of million and million  respectively  resulting primarily from a decline in business activity in also  we made million in interest payments in cash provided by operating activities totaled million in although we incurred a million operating loss for  it included million in depreciation and amortization charges  restructuring charges of million  representing charges primarily for the write down of fixed assets  and million in net impairment losses on investments 
changes in our operating assets and liabilities generated million of cash in major components of these changes included a decrease in accounts receivable and inventories of million and million  respectively  resulting primarily from a decline in business activity in the second half of and the effect of exiting the sbq business 
the decrease in accrued liabilities of million resulted primarily from a lower balance of deferred revenue at december  also  we made million in interest payments in investing cash flows cash flows from investing activities were million in proceeds from sales of long term investments were used for general corporate purposes 
changes in other assets in included million from the cash value of terminated corporate owned life insurance policies 
we made capital investments of million in  primarily for maintenance capital 
we made capital investments totaling million in and million in these capital expenditures were primarily related to improvements to our energy products segment facilities 
we currently estimate that capital spending will be approximately million 
our sources of funding for capital expenditures include available cash flows from operations and borrowing availability under our credit facility 
the amount ultimately spent will depend upon the availability of these resources 
financing cash flows in the second quarter of  we redeemed the remaining million of our outstanding senior secured notes that were due on july  the notes were redeemed at par plus accrued interest and was funded from existing cash balances and borrowings under our credit facility 
in the second quarter of  in connection with the redemption of our senior secured notes  we amended our credit facility 
the facility provides up to million under a borrowing formula that is based upon eligible inventory and accounts receivable  subject to certain reserves and satisfaction of certain conditions to each draw under the facility 
interest rates on the facility vary according to the amount of loans outstanding and range from the prime rate plus to prime plus with respect to domestic rate loans  and from the libor rate plus to libor plus with respect to libor rate loans 
in addition  there is a line usage fee imposed in periods in which the outstanding amount of the line exceeds million 
the credit agreement contains financial and other covenants  including a minimum level of earnings  as defined in the agreement  and limitations on certain types of transactions  including the ability of our subsidiaries to declare and pay dividends 
as of december   we were not in compliance with the minimum level of defined earnings covenant  which resulted in the imposition of million of additional reserves against availability 
at december   we had million of loans and million of letters of credit outstanding under the credit facility and approximately million in additional borrowing availability 
the letters of credit were issued against the credit facility as collateral on our self insured workers compensation program 
the weighted average interest rate on borrowings as of december  was 
the facility is secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of our inventories  accounts receivable  property  plant and equipment and related intangibles 
this facility expires in march in  we received million from the exercise of common stock warrants resulting in the issuance of  of our common shares 
on july   we redeemed million in principal amount of our senior secured notes at par plus accrued interest using existing cash balances 
in addition  repayments of long term debt in included the early retirement of million of principal amount of our senior secured notes 
long term debt maturities for each of the next five years are less than million 
in july we filed a universal shelf registration statement for the issuance and sale from time to time to the public of up to million in securities  including debt  preferred stock  common stock and warrants 
the shelf registration was declared effective by the sec in september we have not sold any securities pursuant to the shelf registration 
see note in the accompanying financial statements for more information on the credit facility and shelf registration 
we believe the shelf registration affords us the financial flexibility to react to future opportunities in the market 
during  we repurchased  of our outstanding shares in open market transactions for million 
at december   we had regular tax net operating loss carryforwards which will fully eliminate the regular tax liability on approximately million of future regular taxable income 
while we may have alternative minimum tax amt liability  we also have amt net operating loss carryforwards which will eliminate of the amt liability on approximately million of future amt income 
while future tax provisions will depend in part on our ongoing assessment of our future ability to utilize our tax benefits  we expect that the tax provisions that we record on approximately the next million in pre tax income will be substantially less than the amounts at full statutory rates 
you should read note to the consolidated financial statements for further information concerning our federal tax status 
critical accounting policies and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to customer claims  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventories  investments  long lived assets  assets held for sale  income taxes  product liability  workers compensation claims  restructuring liabilities  environmental contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from product sales when the product is shipped from our facilities and risk of loss and title has passed to the customer or  at the customer s request  the goods are set aside in storage and are paid for in full 
for transactions where we have not obtained customer acceptance  revenue is deferred until the terms of acceptance are satisfied 
accounts receivable allowances we evaluate the collectibility of our receivables based on a combination of factors 
we regularly analyze our customer accounts and  when we become aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us  such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration of the customer s operating results or financial position  we record a specific reserve for bad debt to reduce the related receivable to the amount we reasonably believe is collectible 
we also maintain a reserve for customer claims for returns of defective materials 
this reserve is recorded as a percentage of sales and estimated based upon historical experience 
the adequacy of reserve estimates is periodically reviewed by comparison to actual experience 
claims in any future period could differ from our estimates and impact the net sales we report 
inventory valuation we value our inventories principally at the lower of cost or market and regularly review the book value to determine if items are properly valued 
we record adjustments to the value of our inventory based on sales and production forecasts 
these adjustments are estimates  which can vary significantly  either favorably or unfavorably  from actual amounts if future costs or levels of business activity differ from our expectations 
generally  we do not experience issues with slow moving or obsolete inventory due to the nature of our products 
if we are not able to achieve our expectations of the net realizable value of the inventory at its current value  we would have to adjust our reserves accordingly 
long lived asset impairment we evaluate our long lived assets used in operations  consisting of property  plant and equipment  when indicators of impairment  such as reductions in demand or significant economic factors are present 
when such indicators of impairment exist  an evaluation is performed to determine whether the carrying value of an asset is impaired based on a comparison to the undiscounted estimated future cash flows from the asset 
the evaluations involve a significant amount of judgment since the results are based on estimated future events 
assets held for sale are reviewed for impairment when we approve the plan to sell  and thereafter while the asset is held for sale 
estimates of anticipated sales prices are highly judgmental and subject to material revision in future periods 
because of the uncertainty inherent in these factors  we cannot predict when or if future impairment charges will be recorded 
during  and  we recorded impairment losses on our long lived assets primarily related to the restructuring of our operations employee benefits plans we record liabilities and expense for deferred compensation agreements  salary continuation agreements sca and postretirement health benefit costs based on actuarial valuations 
all benefits paid under the agreements are unfunded and benefits are paid from operating cash flows 
the net present value of the benefits provided under the deferred compensation agreements were accrued over the period of the employee s active employment from the time the contract was signed to the employee s retirement date using a discount rate of eleven percent  which approximated our incremental borrowing rate at that time 
inherent in the valuations for the sca and postretirement health benefits are key assumptions including assumptions about discount rates 
these assumptions are updated on an annual basis at the beginning of each fiscal year 
we are required to consider current market conditions  including changes in interest rates  in making these assumptions 
to develop our discount rate  we considered the available yields on high quality fixed income investments with maturities corresponding to our benefit obligations 
we used a discount rate of and to determine the sca and postretirement health benefit liability as of december  and  respectively 
the decline in the discount rate used to estimate the sca and postretirement health benefit liability is a result of declining interest rates in the united states 
changes in the related sca and postretirement health benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in the assumptions primarily as a result of changes in the discount rate 
restructuring reserves our restructuring reserves reflect many estimates  including those pertaining to settlements of contractual obligations and environmental remediation obligations 
we reassess the reserve requirements for completing the restructuring program at the end of each reporting period 
actual experience has been and may continue to be different from these estimates 
for example  we recognized million and million of restructuring charges in and  respectively  related to revisions of our estimates for the restructuring plan initiated in as of december  and  liabilities associated with our restructuring program were million and million  respectively 
additional charges may be required in the future if the expected results of litigation and estimates of environmental remediation costs are not realized 
refer to notes and to our consolidated financial statements for more information 
reserves for contingencies we have other potential exposures  such as workers compensation claims  environmental claims  product liability  litigation and recoverability of deferred income taxes 
establishing loss reserves or valuation allowances for these matters requires us to estimate and make judgments with regard to risk exposure and ultimate liability 
we establish accruals for these exposures  however  if our exposure exceeds our estimates  we could be required to record additional charges

purchased steel  in the form of hot rolled coils and steel scrap  represents the largest portion of our cost of goods sold 
the price and availability of steel coils and scrap that we use in our manufacturing processes are highly competitive and volatile 
various factors  most of which are beyond our control  affect the supply and price of steel coils and scrap 
we believe that changes in steel coil and scrap costs have had a significant impact on our earnings  and we expect that future changes will continue to significantly impact our earnings 
reference is made to recent developments in item of this report for recent developments regarding steel costs 
we are exposed to market risk for changes in interest rates for borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at variable rates  and the fair value of the borrowings are not significantly affected by changes in market interest rates 
if the interest rates on our credit facility were to increase by  assuming our borrowings level at december   the increase in our interest expense would be less than million on an annualized basis 
we purchase natural gas and electricity for our operations and  therefore  have a market risk related to gas and electricity purchases in the open market at spot prices 
the prices of such purchases and futures positions are subject to wide fluctuations due to unpredictable factors such as weather  government policies and demand for natural gas and competitive fuels 
as a result  our earnings could be affected by changes in the price and availability of gas and electricity 
as market conditions dictate  we from time to time will lock in future gas and electricity prices using fixed price contracts
