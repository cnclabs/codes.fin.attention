item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  cont d 
significant critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the company s financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
significant accounting policies are defined as those that involve significant judgment and potentially could result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
management believes the following significant accounting policies are affected by our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the company s financial statements 
for a detailed description of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to the company s consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
management has discussed each of these significant accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors 
real estate investments the company applies financial accounting standards board statement no  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  statement to measure impairment in real estate investments 
rental properties are individually evaluated for impairment when conditions exist which may indicate that it is probable that the sum of expected future cash flows on an undiscounted basis without interest from a rental property is less than its historical net cost basis 
these expected future cash flows consider factors such as future operating income  trends and prospects as well as the effects of leasing demand  competition and other factors 
upon determination that a permanent impairment has occurred  rental properties are reduced to their fair value 
for properties to be disposed of  an impairment loss is recognized when the fair value of the property  less the estimated cost to sell  is less than the carrying amount of the property measured at the time there is a commitment to sell the property and or it is actively being marketed for sale 
a property to be disposed of is reported at the lower of its carrying amount or its estimated fair value  less its cost to sell 
subsequent to the date that a property is held for disposition  depreciation expense is not recorded 
securities available for sale investments in non real estate assets consist primarily of marketable equity securities 
management reviews our marketable securities for impairment on an annual basis  or when events or circumstances occur 
if a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary  an impairment charge is recognized in earnings and the cost basis of the individual security shall be written down to fair value as the new cost basis 
management s evaluation includes consideration of events that may be attributable to the unrealized loss  including  among other things  the credit worthiness of the issuer  length of time that a security had a continuous unrealized loss  and the financial position of the issuing company
