overview competitive  economic and industry factors we are an energy company 
we mine coal  which is used to produce electric power  and we own interests in power generating plants 
we will also begin to earn royalties from the production of coalbed methane gas in all of our five mines supply baseloaded power plants that comply with all applicable environmental laws  several of these power plants are located adjacent to our mines  and we sell virtually all our coal under long term contracts 
consequently  our mines enjoy relatively stable demand and pricing compared to competitors who sell more of their production on the spot market 
in partnership with others  we have successfully developed eight independent power projects totaling mw of generating capacity 
we have sold our interests in five of those projects 
we currently own a interest in the rova i and ii coal fired plants  which have a total generating capacity of mw 
we also retain a interest in the fort lupton project  which provides peaking power to the local utility 
the rova project  which accounted for of our equity in earnings from independent power in  is baseloaded and supplies power pursuant to a long term contract 
while the use of gas for electric power generation has grown in recent years  coal provides approximately of the electricity generated in this country and we expect demand for power to grow at approximately per year 
consequently  we believe demand for our products will grow 
sources and uses of revenue and cash in  approximately two thirds of our operating income came from coal operations  and one third came from independent power projects 
the principal uses of revenue were the cost of coal sales  heritage health benefit costs  and selling  general and administrative expenses 
in  in order to finance the purchase of the rosebud  jewett  beulah  and savage mines  westmoreland mining borrowed million from institutional lenders under a term loan agreement 
by the end of  westmoreland mining had repaid million of that million and deposited an additional million into two restricted accounts for the benefit of its lenders 
in early march  westmoreland mining made arrangements to borrow an additional million from the lenders pursuant to what we call the add on facility 
the million fixed rate series c was drawn immediately and the additional million floating rate series d must be drawn before the end of the add on facility will permit westmoreland mining to undertake certain significant capital projects in the near term without adversely affecting cash available to the parent 
we may also seek additional equity in for these purposes 
challenges our five principal challenges today are inflation in medical costs  which can increase our expense for active employees and heritage health benefit costs  bonding issues  transitioning from an approach that maximizes the use of our net operating loss carryforwards to one that considers the impact of the alternative minimum tax  managing the costs of our operations  and addressing the claims for potential taxes asserted by various governmental entities 
we discuss these issues  as well as the other challenges we face  elsewhere in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  including under trends and uncertainties 
we remain committed to meeting our obligation for accumulated dividends to preferred shareholders 
as of january   million has accumulated 
dividends of per depositary share per quarter are now being paid 
the accumulated amount will continue to increase until quarterly dividends of per depositary share are paid in full 
critical accounting estimates and related matters our discussion and analysis of financial condition  results of operations  liquidity and capital resources is based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
generally accepted accounting principles require that we make estimates and judgments 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates 
we have made significant judgments and estimates in connection with the following accounting matters 
our senior management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of the accounting estimates in the section below with the audit committee of our board of directors 
in connection with our discussion of these critical accounting matters  and in order to reduce repetition  we also use this section to present information related to these judgments and estimates 
postretirement benefits and pension obligations our most significant long term obligation is the obligation to provide postretirement medical benefits  pension benefits  workers compensation and pneumoconiosis black lung benefits 
we provide these benefits to our current and former employees and their dependents 
estimates and judgments we estimate the total amount of these obligations with the help of third party professionals using actuarial assumptions and information 
our estimate is sensitive to judgments we make about the discount rate  about the rate of inflation in medical care  about mortality rates  and about the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of the medicare reform act 
we review these estimates and obligations at least annually 
we pay these obligations currently and will in the future although presumably at an eventually declining rate determined by the number of people covered 
under generally accepted accounting principles  we are required to estimate the present value of these obligations 
in order to do this  we make a judgment about the discount rate  which is an estimate about the current interest rate at which these obligations could be effectively settled on the date we estimate them 
the discount rate used to calculate the present value of these future obligations was in  in  and in significant changes to interest rates result in substantial volatility to our financial statements by influencing our estimate of these amounts 
in order to estimate the total cost of our obligation to provide medical benefits  we must make a judgment about the rate of inflation in medical costs 
as our estimate of the rate of inflation of medical costs increases  our calculation of the total cost of providing these benefits increases 
during  we increased our assumption about this rate to  and we also assumed that the rate would ultimately decline to in and beyond 
if we were to increase our assumption of the ultimate medical inflation rate from to  then all other things being equal  the present value of our postretirement medical cost obligation would increase by approximately million 
our accrual for postretirement medical benefits is also impacted by the mortality rate of the population for which we provide benefits 
as people live longer  our costs to provide postretirement medical care increases 
however  the number of assigned beneficiaries for our company under the coal act is fixed  since we discontinued our eastern underground operations  and the primary beneficiaries are elderly 
the medicare reform act provides certain prescription drug benefits 
we have estimated that the medicare reform act reduced the present value of our future health care obligations by million as of december  there is no authoritative guidance on accounting for the medicare reform act  and we may be required to revise our estimate when guidance becomes available 
related information the present value of our actuarially determined liability for postretirement medical costs increased approximately million between december  and  principally because of an increase in actual costs over prior estimates and for the reasons described above 
actuarial valuations project that our retiree health benefit costs will continue to increase in the near term and then decline to zero over the next approximately sixty years as the number of eligible beneficiaries declines 
we incurred cash costs of million for postretirement medical costs during compared to million in  and we expect to incur approximately million for these costs in including the combined fund s retroactive assessment balance of million  which we must pay pending the outcome of that litigation 
we incurred cash costs of million for workers compensation benefits during compared to million in we expect to incur fewer cash costs for workers compensation benefits in and expect that amount to steadily decline to zero over the next approximately eighteen years 
we anticipate that these costs will decline because we are no longer self insured for workers compensation benefits and have had no new claimants since we do not pay black lung benefits directly 
these benefits are paid from a trust that we established 
the trust is overfunded by million as of december  we do not expect to be required to make additional contributions to the trust 
the coal act  passed in  established three benefit plans 
first  the statute merged the umwa and plans into the combined fund 
the combined fund provides benefits to a completely closed pool of beneficiaries  retirees who were actually receiving benefits from either the or plan as of july  the coal act requires the benefits provided to this group to remain substantially the same as provided by the and plans as of january  this group is essentially medicare eligible and the combined fund serves as a medicare supplement 
second  the coal act requires individual employer plans iep established in prior collective bargaining agreements to be maintained and requires the level of benefits to be substantially the same as beneficiaries received as of january  the statutorily required iep applies to retirees meeting age and service requirements as of february  and who actually retired before september  third  the coal act establishes the umwa benefit plan to serve three distinct populations miners who were eligible to retire as of february  and actually retired before september  and whose employers are no longer in business miners receiving benefits under an iep but whose former employer goes out of business new spouses or new dependants of retirees in the combined fund we maintain an iep for our own retirees and the premiums we pay cover a portion of the retired miners whose previous employers have gone out of business 
in addition to these coal act requirements  we continue to provide similar benefits under another iep to a smaller group of former umwa employees who retired under the company s last collective bargaining agreement which ended in this plan is known as the plan 
as noted above  we expect that the medicare reform act will reduce our prescription drug costs 
the medicare reform act provides a prescription drug benefit under medicare as well as a federal subsidy  starting in so long as an employer maintains qualifying health plans that provide prescription drug benefits 
we currently estimate that the medicare reform act will reduce our retiree medical costs by approximately million in and annually thereafter until total drug costs begin to decline 
asset retirement obligations  reclamation costs and reserve estimates asset retirement obligations primarily relate to the closure of mines and the reclamation of land upon cessation of mining 
we account for reclamation costs  along with other costs related to mine closure  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
asset retirement obligations sfas no 
 which we adopted on january  this statement requires us to recognize the fair value of an asset retirement obligation in the period in which we incur that obligation 
we capitalize the present value of our estimated asset retirement costs as part of the carrying amount of our long lived assets 
the liability  asset retirement obligations  represents our estimate of the present value of the cost of closing our mines and reclaiming land that has been disturbed by mining 
this liability increases as land is mined and decreases as reclamation work is performed and cash expended 
the asset  property  plant and equipment capitalized asset retirement costs  remains constant until new liabilities are incurred or old liabilities are re estimated 
we estimate the future costs of reclamation using standards for mine reclamation that have been established by the government agencies that regulate our operations as well as our own experience in performing reclamation activities 
these estimates may change 
developments in our mining program also affect this estimate by influencing the timing of reclamation expenditures 
adopting sfas no 
significantly affected our financial statements 
see the summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements  which includes a discussion of the effect on our financial statements of adopting sfas no 
however  the adoption of sfas no 
did not affect our cash costs  because the annual cash requirements for reclamation activities are the same using sfas no 
and the units of production accrual method  the accounting method we used prior to adopting sfas no 
we amortize our acquisition costs  development costs  capitalized asset retirement costs and some plant and equipment using the units of production method and estimates of recoverable proven and probable reserves 
we review these estimates on a regular basis and adjust them to reflect our current mining plans 
the rate at which we record depletion also depends on the estimates of our reserves 
if the estimates of recoverable proven and probable reserves decline  the rate at which we record depletion increases 
such a decline in reserves may result from geological conditions  coal quality  effects of governmental  environmental and tax regulations  and assumptions about future prices and future operating costs 
deferred income taxes estimates and judgments our net income is sensitive to estimates we make about our ability to use our federal net operating loss carryforwards  or nols 
as of december   we had approximately million of nols 
these nols expire at various dates through when we have taxable income  we can use our nols to shield that income from regular us federal income tax 
our ability to use our nols thus depends on all the factors that determine taxable income  including operational factors  such as new coal sales  and non operational factors  such as increases in heritage health benefit costs 
under federal tax law  our ability to use our nols would be limited if we had a change of ownership within the meaning of the federal tax code 
our nols are one of our deferred income tax assets 
we have reduced our deferred income tax assets by a valuation allowance 
the valuation allowance is primarily an estimate of the deferred tax assets that may not be realized in future periods 
on a quarterly and annual basis  we estimate how much of our nols we will be able to use to shield future taxable income and make corresponding adjustments in the valuation allowance 
if we increase our estimated utilization of nols  we decrease the valuation allowance and increase our net deferred income tax assets and recognize an income tax benefit in earnings 
if we decrease our estimated utilization of nols  we increase the valuation allowance and decrease our net deferred income tax assets and increase income tax expense 
these changes can materially affect our net income and our assets 
in  for example  we reduced the valuation allowance by million  in part because we signed a new coal supply agreement and because we negotiated improved terms of an existing coal supply agreement 
we also made other adjustments in our net deferred tax assets 
as a result of these estimates and adjustments and changes in temporary differences between book and tax accounting  our net deferred income tax assets increased from million at december  to million at december   and we recognized income tax benefit from continuing operations of million 
related information our nols are important to our strategy 
and under the federal tax laws  there are two types of nols  regular nols and alternative minimum tax  or amt  nols 
nols can offset our future taxable income  permit us to avoid payment of regular federal income tax and thereby increase our cash flow and return from profitable investments as compared to the return a tax paying entity would receive that cannot shield its income from federal income taxation 
however  regular nols will not shield our income from amt 
under the federal tax laws  there are two types of taxable income  regular taxable income and alternative minimum taxable income  or amti 
to determine amti  items such as percentage depletion are added to our regular taxable income 
we have significant percentage depletion because of our mining activities 
we are subject to amt at a rate 
as of december   we had amt net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million reduced from million as of december  only of amti can be shielded each year by amt nols 
any amt paid is available as a credit against future regular federal income tax  and the credits do not expire 
based upon our estimates of our future taxable income  we expect to fully utilize our remaining amt nols in and begin paying the full amt in we may owe more than million per year in amt until we fully utilize our regular nols 
as a strategic matter  we may face choices between business strategies intended to reduce amt and strategies that increase the use of our regular nols 
some of these may involve decisions about business activities that generate amti  and many of these choices will require us to make judgments about matters that will arise in the future and that are therefore inherently uncertain 
contractual obligations and commitments the following table presents information about our contractual obligations and commitments as of december  some of the figures below are estimates 
we discuss these obligations and commitments elsewhere in this filing 
payments due by period in thousands of dollars contractual obligations and commitments total after westmoreland mining term debt       westmoreland coal company revolving debt other debt    operating leases    heritage health benefit pension undiscounted obligations workers compensation       umwa pension discounted obligations combined benefit fund multiemployer       postretirement medical       qualified pension benefits    serp benefits   pneumoconiosis       reclamation costs       preferred dividends     per year at december   westmoreland mining had deposited million in two restricted accounts as collateral against these obligations 
we have settled the umwa pension obligation  as discussed in item legal proceedings 
except for retroactive premium assessments of approximately million that we are contesting  we have not accrued the present value of this obligation  because this plan is a multiemployer plan 
we expense our premium payments when due 
the table presents our estimate of our gross benefit obligation 
the accrued liability  net of the unrecognized net actuarial loss and the unrecognized net transition obligation  was million as of december the fair value of plan assets at december  was million 
pension benefits will be paid from these assets 
the table presents our estimate of our gross benefit obligation 
the accrued liability  net of the unrecognized net actuarial gain and an unrecognized prior service cost  was million as of december  the plan was unfunded at december  the fair value of plan assets at december  was million 
pneumoconiosis benefits will be paid from these assets 
the table presents our estimate of our gross cost of final reclamation 
the accrued liability of million as of december  will increase in present value as acres are disturbed in mining operations and as mine closures draw nearer 
the accrued liability reflects the present value of contractual obligations of our customers and washington group  the contract miner at the absaloka mine  to perform reclamation  we estimate that the gross amount of their obligations is million 
the table also does not reflect million  the amount held in escrow as of december  from contributions by customers for reclamation of the rosebud mine 
we estimate that the present value of our net expense for final reclamation that is  the costs of final reclamation that are not the contractual responsibilities of others is million 
represents quarterly dividends that are accumulated through and including january  as provided in the certificate of designation establishing the series a preferred stock  the holders of the series a preferred stock are entitled to receive dividends when  as and if declared by the board of directors out of funds of the corporation legally available therefore 
in general  dividends that are not paid cumulate  as provided in the certificate of designation 
growth and development strategy our growth and development strategy is founded on the ownership and operation of profitable physical assets 
we strive to identify assets that are low cost producers and environmental leaders and that supply customers who share our orientation for low cost production and our environmental concern 
we believe that we will be more likely to achieve success in niche markets 
our goal is to acquire stable  long term earnings 
we will use our nols to shield that income from regular us federal income tax 
our acquisitions of the four coal operations in reflect the implementation of this strategy 
examples of our current development efforts include the following in  property we own in southern colorado was leased and development of coalbed methane gas commenced 
twelve wells were drilled by year end and in early the wells were completed and production began 
in  as part of our transaction with knife river  we acquired rights to develop the lignite deposits at gascoyne  north dakota 
our subsidiary  westmoreland power  inc  has joined with mdu resources group  inc 
to pursue development of a baseloaded lignite fired power plant near gascoyne as part of the state of north dakota s lignite vision lv program 
lv is a partnership between north dakota and the lignite energy council lec that is administered by the north dakota industrial commission ndic 
westmoreland power and mdu executed a joint development agreement in  and we each own half of the venture that is seeking to develop the power plant 
in september  ndic awarded the westmoreland mdu joint venture up to million in matching funds to finance feasibility and technical studies 
in january  as a result of these studies  we and mdu sought additional support from ndic to study the feasibility of substituting a mw or mw power plant for the mw plant that had originally been proposed 
ndic awarded the funds sought  and we and mdu completed studies of generation technology  and lignite mining issues in air quality evaluation will be completed in an existing source of future income and cash flow relates to the caballo mine in campbell county  wyoming 
in connection with the acquisitions  we acquired the stock of horizon coal services  inc horizon s only asset is a royalty interest in coal reserves located at the caballo mine  which is owned by another company 
the royalty of 
per ton covers the mining of million tons of coal  making the gross royalty amount million 
the latest mine plan projects that mining of coal subject to the royalty will begin in another source of potential future income may involve rova 
lg e power inc lpi has informed us that lpi may be interested in selling all of its independent power operations  including its interest in the partnership that owns the rova project 
lpi has initiated a bid process to identify potential purchasers 
westmoreland energy has certain rights under its partnership agreement with lpi to acquire lpi s interest in the rova project 
liquidity and capital resources as discussed in the overview section above  we believe that our recent add on term debt facility substantially improves our near term liquidity 
in addition  even though the requirements of westmoreland mining s basic term loan agreement  including debt service requirements  restrict our access to some of westmoreland mining s cash  westmoreland mining itself generates significant liquidity 
as discussed in more detail in the liquidity outlook section below  we expect to achieve increasing cash from operations in  offset by higher capital expenditures at our mines that will reduce free cash flow 
cash provided by operating activities was million in  million in and million in cash from operations in compared to declined primarily because we had less operating income because of the anticipated change in the pricing structure at the jewett mine 
the coal supply agreement changed from a cost plus fees contract to a market based contract in july of the decline in our cash from operations was affected by an increase in our deferred tax assets  gains from the sale of dta  and a net increase in our other assets 
the net change in assets and liabilities was million in compared to million in  resulting from higher non cash expenses for pension and postretirement medical obligations 
also  cash from operations in benefited by approximately million from a favorable judgment in a dispute with the us army concerning a power project in fort drum  new york  in which we owned an interest 
working capital was million at december  compared to million at december  the change resulted primarily from a million reduction in the current portion of our deferred income tax assets and an increase in the current portion of our postretirement medical costs  mostly attributable to the accrual of the retroactive premiums assessed by the combined fund 
we used million of cash in investing activities in  million in and million in cash used in investing activities in included million of additions to property  plant and equipment for mine equipment and leases for coal reserves 
cash used in investing activities in also includes million that we deposited in restricted accounts  pursuant to our term loan agreement and as collateral for our bonds 
during  net proceeds from sales of assets of million included million cash received from the sale of dta and million received from the sale of land and mineral rights in colorado 
in  additions to property and equipment using cash totaled million  and we received million from the absaloka mine s mining contractor to settle a dispute regarding repair of the dragline at that mine 
also during  we deposited million into restricted cash accounts for debt service  security deposits and reclamation deposit accounts 
those deposits were offset by the million refund of collateral we received from the umwa 
in  we used million of cash in investing activities to purchase the rosebud  jewett  beulah  and savage mines 
other additions to our property  plant and equipment totaled million in cash provided by investing activities in included million in proceeds from the sale of our interests in three independent power projects 
we used million of cash in financing activities in  including million for the net repayment of long term debt and million for the net repayment of revolving debt 
cash used in financing activities in primarily represented repayment of long term debt of million and the net repayment of revolving debt of million 
cash provided by financing activities for totaled million  mainly from the proceeds of long term and revolving debt used in the acquisitions 
dividends paid to westmoreland resources shareholder in  and were million  million and million  respectively 
consolidated cash and cash equivalents at december  totaled million including million at westmoreland mining  million at westmoreland resources  and million at our captive insurance subsidiary 
at december   cash and cash equivalents totaled million including million at westmoreland mining  million at westmoreland resources  and million at the captive insurance subsidiary 
the cash at westmoreland mining is available to us through quarterly distributions  as described below 
the cash at westmoreland resources is available to us through dividends 
in addition  we had restricted cash and bond collateral  which were not classified as cash or cash equivalents  of million at december  and million at december  the restricted cash at december  included million in westmoreland mining s accounts 
our reclamation  workers compensation and postretirement medical cost obligation bonds were collateralized by interest bearing cash deposits of million  which amount we have classified as a non current asset 
in addition  we have reclamation deposits of million  which we received from customers of the rosebud mine to pay for reclamation 
we also have million in interest bearing debt reserve accounts for the rova project 
this cash is restricted as to its use and is classified as part of our investment in independent power projects 
in early march  westmoreland mining entered into the add on term debt facility 
this facility will make million available to us 
the add on facility will permit westmoreland mining to undertake certain significant capital projects in the near term without adversely affecting cash available at the parent 
although the terms of the add on facility permit westmoreland mining to distribute this million to westmoreland coal company  the original term loan agreement  which financed our acquisition of the rosebud  jewett  beulah  and savage mines  continues to restrict westmoreland mining s ability to make distributions to westmoreland coal company from ongoing operations 
until westmoreland mining has fully paid the original acquisition debt  which is scheduled for december   westmoreland mining may only pay westmoreland coal company a management fee and distribute to westmoreland coal company of westmoreland mining s surplus cash flow 
westmoreland mining is depositing the remaining into an account that will fund the million balloon payment due december  at the same time that westmoreland mining entered into the add on facility  it also extended its revolving credit facility to and reduced the amount of the facility to million 
westmoreland mining reduced the amount of the revolving facility to better align its capacity to its expected usage and borrowing base 
as of december   westmoreland coal company had million of its million revolving line of credit available to borrow 
westmoreland coal company is seeking to increase its revolving credit facility from to million and extend that facility for one year  from to we may also seek additional equity to finance our growth and development strategy and for general corporate needs 
liquidity outlook significant anticipated variances between and we anticipate that the following events and developments  which we expect will occur in but which did not occur in  and the following events and developments  which we expect will not occur in but which did occur in  will affect our liquidity and our net income 
we anticipate that our coal revenues will be higher  principally because of increased sales from the absaloka and rosebud mines  partially offset by decreased sales from the jewett mine 
we anticipate that our cost of coal sales will increase commensurate with the increase in production  and because of higher near term costs at the jewett mine 
in the fourth quarter of  operations at the jewett mine encountered an area where the stripping ratio the ratio between the volume of overburden to the volume of the coal was higher 
we anticipate that capital expenditures related to our mining activities will be higher in than in we expect that most of the increase in will be associated with mine development at the jewett mine  which is necessary to improve mining conditions 
the settlement with the plan permitted us to reverse an accrued liability and recognize million of income in this is a non recurring item  but we will also avoid payments of approximately million per year in each of the next three and one half years 
in  we received million upon the sale of our interest in dta  million from north central s sale of surface and mineral rights  and  in bonus payments from north central s lease of coalbed methane rights 
we do not anticipate having significant asset sales in in  we did not receive royalties from sales of coalbed methane 
we anticipate that we will receive royalties from sales of coalbed methane in in  we received a  distribution from the fort lupton project 
we call this a catch up distribution because most of it related to periods prior to we may receive a relatively small quarterly distribution from ft 
lupton in we sold our interest in dta effective june  we were incurring losses from dta at an annual rate of about million  and our share of those losses in was about million 
we will not have losses from dta in arbitration of the profit component of the price reopener with the owners of colstrip units took place in the first week of march we expect that the arbitration will result in a price increase  retroactive to  and that we will receive a lump sum payment in for the retroactive piece 
we anticipate that our interest income will be higher in than it was in because of continued deposits to westmoreland mining restricted accounts 
we anticipate higher interest costs in because of the additional million in fixed rate borrowed as of march we accrued the entire amount of the combined fund s retroactive assessment in our cash cost will increase in as compared with as we pay this assessment 
we are challenging this assessment  as discussed in item legal proceedings 
during the next eighteen months  we plan to implement a common  corporate wide enterprise resource planning system it system to enhance our reporting and analysis capability 
the initial investment is expected to be approximately million but is also expected to deliver an acceptable return on investment through improved efficiencies and reduced costs associated with our current  separate systems 
we anticipate that the expense associated with the performance unit plan will be lower in than it was in in  we adopted a long term incentive plan to promote the successful implementation of our strategic plan and link the compensation of our key managers to the appreciation in the price of our common stock 
the value of the performance units awarded in was based on the absolute increase in market value of our common stock over the period july  to june  because the value of our common stock appreciated per share over that period  the value of the performance units at the end of the performance period was million 
this obligation is being paid out over time and may be paid in cash or stock 
the board s compensation benefits committee also awarded performance units in and the value of the and awards is based on the appreciation of our common stock compared to that of our peers  and the value of these awards is capped 
the potential maximum value of the performance units awarded in and is million and million  respectively 
because stockholders had approved a long term stock incentive plan at our annual meeting  we were able to use stock options as the sole vehicle for the long term incentive program 
we have three defined benefit pension plans for full time employees 
we were not required to make any contributions to those plans in however  we will be required to contribute million to the plans in  and we may be required to make additional contributions in future years unless the return on the plans investments materially improves or the plans funding requirements change 
significant factors affecting our liquidity the matters discussed above focus on anticipated differences between and it will be readily apparent that a number of non recurring events significantly influenced our results 
our operational performance  our financial results  and our liquidity may also be affected by all of the other matters discussed in this annual report on form k  including the legal proceedings discussed in item and the matters discussed in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
primarily because of our size and the multitude of issues related to our transition from an eastern underground producer of coal  to a western niche surface producer with significant reliance on independent power operations  we have been subject to the impact of many matters beyond our control 
for all of the foregoing reasons  and while we anticipate that we will be profitable in  we cannot project our overall level of profitability 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements within the meaning of the rules of the securities and exchange commission 
results of operations compared to coal operations 
we sold about million more tons of coal in than we did in  but our coal revenues decreased million 
revenues declined because  for part of  the jewett mine benefited from a cost plus fees pricing structure in its contract with texas genco 
we sold more tons at all of our mines in than we did in  with the exception of the beulah mine  which was adversely affected by a longer than expected major maintenance outage at the coyote station 
in addition  the rosebud mine was adversely affected by an unscheduled outage at the colstrip station 
costs  as a percentage of revenues  increased to in compared to in  again largely as a result of the lower average sales price in at the jewett mine 
also  the implementation of sfas no 
increased non cash accretion costs at all mines for future reclamation activities and reduced margins in the following table shows comparative coal revenues  sales volumes  cost of sales and percentage changes between the periods year ended change revenues thousands   volumes millions of equivalent coal tons cost of sales thousands   depreciation  depletion and amortization increased to million in compared to million in due to capital expenditures and increased depreciation resulting from the increase in production levels 
independent power 
our equity in earnings from independent power operations increased from million in to million in during and  the rova project produced  and  megawatt hours  respectively  and achieved average capacity factors of and  respectively 
also  we recognized  in equity in earnings in from our interest in the ft 
lupton project  most of which was retroactive 
costs and expenses 
selling and administrative expenses increased from million in to million in contributing to the increase were higher heritage health benefit costs and a higher compensation expense for long term employee performance incentives 
heritage health benefit costs were million in compared to million in five factors contributed to the increase the combined fund assessed the million retroactive premium discussed above 
we incurred an additional million expense for postretirement medical obligations  principally because of a change in the discount rate and inflation in medical costs 
we incurred an additional million expense resulting from negative actuarial valuation adjustments for our workers compensation and black lung obligations 
we eliminated million in previously recognized obligations to the umwa pension plan 
we incurred increased legal fees associated with coal contract negotiations and litigation 
a redesign of our health care plans for active employees in and aggressive management of medical expenses reduced our health care costs by promoting better employee consumerism and increasing employees premium payments 
long term incentive compensation increased from million in to million in this expense was entirely attributable to the performance unit plan  described above 
this expense is a non cash expense until it is paid 
as permitted by the plan  we paid about of the expense   in cash and  in shares of common stock in  leaving an obligation of million as of december  absent the impact of heritage health benefit costs and long term compensation expense  selling  and administrative expenses in were consistent with those in interest expense was million and million for and  respectively 
the decrease was mainly due to the continued repayment of westmoreland mining s debt 
interest income decreased in because of lower rates 
other income in includes a million gain in connection with the favorable judgment in the dispute with the us army 
terminal operations 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  effective june   we sold our interest in dta and recognized a pre tax gain of approximately million 
our consolidated financial statements for and earlier periods reflect dta as discontinued operations 
our share of operating losses from dta was approximately million for the six months we owned it in compared to million related to a full year s ownership in during  we expensed as a non cash impairment charge our remaining investment of million in dta as a result of continuing losses and an agreement by one of the terminal s other owners to sell its interest for a loss 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
we adopted sfas no 
during first quarter  as described in the section on critical accounting policies above 
the cumulative effect of the change was a gain of  net of tax expense of  we also reduced our recorded liability for mine reclamation from million to million as of january  and reduced the net book value of our property  plant and equipment from million to million as a result of adopting this standard 
results of operations compared to coal operations 
the following table shows comparative coal revenues  sales volumes  cost of sales and percentage changes between the periods year ended change revenues thousands   volumes millions of equivalent coal tons cost of sales thousands   depreciation  depletion and amortization increased to million in compared to million in due to capital expenditures and a full year of coal production from the rosebud  jewett  beulah  and savage mines 
independent power 
equity in earnings from the independent power operations was million in compared to million in three projects contributed million in earnings in before we sold them in march during and  the rova project produced  and  megawatt hours  respectively  and achieved average capacity factors of and  respectively 
the decrease in was attributable to a small increase in the number of forced outage days for repairs 
terminal operations 
our share of losses from dta was million in compared to million in  principally because of reduced demand in foreign countries for us coal and our obligation to pay our share of dta s expenses 
we took an impairment charge during the third quarter of in an amount equal to the book value of our remaining investment in dta million 
this was a non cash charge 
we took this charge in part because of the terms pursuant to which one of our partners had agreed to sell its interest in dta 
this charge did not reduce our obligation to pay our share of dta s operating expenses 
we sold our interest in dta effective june  costs and expenses 
selling and administrative expenses were million for compared to million in the amounts for and include million and million  respectively  incurred by the four mines acquired in partially offsetting the increase was lower non cash compensation expense for long term employee performance incentives  with an expense of million in compared to an expense of million during the overall increase in selling and administrative expenses in is also due to higher legal costs related primarily to westmoreland resources dispute with washington group and an adverse judgment  with associated legal costs totaling million  in the basin landowner case described in item  to annual salary increases  and to the addition of employees associated with our growth 
medical claims under our self insured plan for active employees were also higher in benefited from a reduction of approximately  in the estimated liability for reclamation of a site we previously operated in virginia while had a  additional benefit when we transferred that site to another operator 
heritage health benefit costs increased to million in compared to million in  reflecting increased costs for the postretirement medical plans as actuarially determined  despite a decrease in payments made to the combined fund 
during  we recognized a million gain in connection with a dispute with the us army 
interest expense was million and million for and  respectively 
the increase was mainly due to the acquisition financing obtained during the second quarter of  despite repayment of million term debt of the acquisition financing during interest income decreased in because of lower rates 
as a result of our acquisitions  we recognized a million deferred income tax asset in april this assumes that a portion of previously unrecognized nols will be utilized because we projected that we would generate taxable income in the future 
the deferred asset increased to million as of december  from million at december  because of temporary differences such as accruals for pension and reclamation expense  which are not deductible for tax purposes until paid arising during the intervening period and because of a reduction of the deferred income tax valuation allowance discussed above 
deferred tax assets are comprised of both a current and long term portion 
when taxable income is generated  the deferred tax asset relating to our nols is reduced and a deferred tax expense non cash is recognized  although no regular federal income taxes are paid 
income tax benefit for represents a current income tax obligation for state income taxes  and the utilization of a portion of our nols  net of the impact of changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
other comprehensive income 
total other comprehensive loss in was million net of income taxes of million  primarily due to the recognition of an additional minimum pension liability of million 
this additional minimum liability was required to be recorded due to the underfunded status of our pension obligations 
the remaining other comprehensive loss of  net of income taxes of  recognized during represents the change in the unrealized loss on an interest rate swap agreement on rova s debt caused by changes in market interest rates during the period 
this compares to other comprehensive loss relating to this arrangement of million net of income taxes of million for new accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
revised december  consolidation of variable interest entities fin r  which addresses how a business enterprise should evaluate whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity through means other than voting rights and accordingly should consolidate the entity 
fin r replaces fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  which was issued in january we do not have interests in any variable interest entities and  therefore  fin r will not affect us 
fasb statement no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity  was issued in may this statement establishes standards for the classification and measurement of certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
the statement also includes required disclosures for financial instruments within its scope 
the statement was effective for us for instruments entered into or modified after may  and otherwise will be effective as of january   except for mandatorily redeemable financial instruments 
for certain mandatorily redeemable financial instruments  the statement will be effective for us of january  the effective date has been deferred indefinitely for certain other types of mandatorily redeemable financial instruments 
we currently do not have any financial instruments that are within the scope of this statement 
trends and uncertainties in addition to the trends and uncertainties described in items and of this annual report on form k and elsewhere in this management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition  we are subject to the trends and uncertainties set forth below 
operational risks associated with the coal business 
our coal mining operations are all surface mines 
these mines are subject to conditions or events beyond our control that could disrupt operations  affect production and the cost of mining at particular mines for varying lengths of time and have a significant impact on our operating results 
these conditions or events have included unplanned equipment failures and the need to repair and maintain our capital equipment  including our draglines  geological conditions  such as variations in the quality of the coal produced from a particular seam  variations in the thickness of coal seams  and variations in the amounts of rock and other natural materials that overlie the coal that we are mining  and weather conditions 
issues related to several of our coal supply agreements 
we face risk due to potential disputes and expiration of our coal supply agreements 
our contract disputes with texas genco have been addressed through under our recent settlement agreement  but differences may occur as to the interpretation of various contract provisions after we have settled the cost component under the colstrip price reopener and have concluded arbitration proceedings related to the profit component 
the arbitrators decision is pending and may or may not meet or exceed our profit expectations 
expiring contracts in the near term include westmoreland resources contract with midwest energy resources company at the end of and dakota westmoreland s contract with the heskett station at the end of as a general matter  the company s mines are dedicated to supply a relatively small number of customer plants 
interruptions in the operations of our primary customer plants pose risk due to limited alternate coal sales outlets 
events causing the discontinuation of operations at any one of our primary customer plants or causing a negative modification to any one of our primary coal sales contracts could result in material consequences to the company 
we are a party to numerous legal proceedings  some of which  if determined unfavorably to us  could affect us materially and adversely 
we are a party to the legal proceedings described in item of this annual report on form k 
some of these proceedings  including the dispute with halifax county  north carolina  could require us to pay significant sums to various parties 
halifax county asserts that the rova project owes million in back taxes  penalty and interest 
if the assessment is upheld  in addition to the amounts assessed  the rova project s future taxes would increase approximately  per year  of which we would be responsible for half 
the mcgreevey litigation challenges our transaction with entech in which we acquired the rosebud and jewett mines and other assets 
although we believe our position in this case is meritorious  the litigation is in a very preliminary stage  and there can be no assurance about the outcome 
we would be materially and adversely affected by a decision that required us to surrender ownership of the rosebud and jewett mines without compensating us fairly 
we may face difficulties managing our growth 
at the end of  we owned one mine and employed people 
in the spring of  we acquired the rosebud  jewett  beulah  and savage mines  and at the end of  we employed people 
this growth has placed significant demands on our management as well as our financial and operational resources and systems 
among other things  we inherited systems developed by entech and knife river for their operations 
we expect to begin deploying an enterprise resource planning system throughout our company in although we expect that this system will be expensive  we also expect that it will improve our ability to manage our operations 
to manage our expanded operations and growth effectively  we must maintain and enhance our financial and accounting systems  our safety programs  and our other operational systems 
one of the principal challenges associated with our growth has been  and we believe will continue to be  our need to attract and retain highly skilled employees and managers 
we cannot assure you that the deployment of our enterprise resource planning system will be successful or that we will be able to attract and retain the personnel we need to manage our increasingly large and complex operations 
our growth and development strategy may not be successful 
we describe our growth and development strategy above 
we regularly seek opportunities to make additional strategic acquisitions  to expand existing businesses  to develop new operations and to enter related businesses 
we consider potential acquisition opportunities as they are identified  but we may not be able to consummate any particular acquisition 
we anticipate that we would finance acquisitions and development activities by using our existing capital resources  borrowing under existing bank credit facilities  issuing equity securities or incurring additional indebtedness 
we may not have sufficient available capital resources or access to additional capital to execute potential acquisitions or take advantage of development opportunities  and we may not find suitable acquisition candidates at acceptable prices 
our current or future acquisition and development efforts may not be successful  and we may not be able to complete any acquisition or project on terms that are favorable to us 
acquisitions and the development of projects involve risks  including difficulties in integrating acquired and new operations  diversions of management resources  debt incurred in financing such activities and unanticipated problems and liabilities 
any of these risks could have a material adverse effect upon our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our substantial indebtedness may affect our financial performance 
as of december   our total indebtedness was approximately million  which included westmoreland mining s obligations under the term loan agreement 
in march  westmoreland mining made arrangements to borrow an additional million through an add on facility  million of which was drawn immediately and million of which must be drawn in the fourth quarter of all of this money is distributable to wcc without restriction 
we may also incur additional indebtedness in the future 
westmoreland mining s underlying term loan agreement restricts its ability to distribute cash to westmoreland coal company through and limits the types of transactions that westmoreland mining and its subsidiaries can engage in with westmoreland coal company and our other subsidiaries 
after payment of principal and interest  of westmoreland mining s surplus cash flow is dedicated to an account that will fund the final payment of its acquisition debt due on december  westmoreland mining has pledged or mortgaged substantially all of its assets and the assets of the rosebud  jewett  beulah  and savage mines as security for its indebtedness 
in addition  westmoreland mining must comply with financial ratios specified in the agreement 
failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default which  if not cured or waived  could have a material adverse effect on us 
the degree to which we are leveraged could have important consequences  including reducing the availability of the cash flow to fund working capital  capital expenditures or other general corporate uses  increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital  capital expenditures or other general corporate requirements  and limiting our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and in the industry 
if we or westmoreland mining do not have sufficient cash flows and capital resources to meet our debt service obligations  we or westmoreland mining may be forced to sell assets  seek additional capital or seek to restructure or refinance our indebtedness 
these alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us or westmoreland mining to meet scheduled debt service obligations 
in the absence of such operating results and resources  we or westmoreland mining could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to sell material assets or operations to attempt to meet debt service and other obligations 
if westmoreland mining were to default on its debt service obligations  a note holder may be able to foreclose on assets that are important to our business 
exposure to bonding and insurance costs 
bonding capacity and insurance costs continue to challenge us and our industry 
we are required to post surety bonds under smcra and other mining laws to ensure that reclamation will be performed  and we are also required to post bonds to secure our obligations under the coal act 
many participants in the coal industry have been informed by their insurance companies that the insurance companies no longer will provide surety bonds without collateral 
we may be required to post additional collateral for our bonds in the future 
depending on the amount that our insurers require  we may not be able to provide cash collateral 
if we were unable to provide cash collateral  we may seek to provide a letter of credit or other assurance of payment 
we may not be able to obtain letters of credit on satisfactory terms  if at all  and letters of credit may be significantly more costly to us than surety bonds 
if we or westmoreland mining fail to maintain statutorily required bonds  we and westmoreland mining may be in default under our agreements with our respective lenders 
a default under these agreements would have a material and adverse effect on us 
the failure to maintain bonds could itself have a material and adverse effect on us by disrupting our mining operations 
our insurance costs have increased and may continue to increase 
we have been able to address a portion of these costs by organizing westmoreland risk management and retaining a portion of the risk associated with our operations 
however  westmoreland risk management has limited capacity and has not been able to protect us completely from the increases in rates for property and casualty insurance since september  the creditworthiness of certain of our customers has declined 
our ability to receive payment for the coal we sell depends on the creditworthiness of our customers 
in general  the creditworthiness of certain of our customers has declined 
because the plants that we supply are baseloaded  we believe that we are protected from a portion of the credit risk associated with this decline 
for example  on september   northwestern corporation  a owner of colstrip units  filed for bankruptcy protection 
on september   northwestern corporation defaulted on its obligations to make payments to the rosebud mine 
in late october  the bankruptcy court entered an order approving western energy as a critical vendor and permitting northwestern corporation to pay all of the amounts claimed by western energy at that time  and thereafter northwestern corporation has continued to make timely payments 
however  northwestern s bankruptcy is illustrative of the pressures affecting the energy industry generally 
we face significant competition 
the coal industry is highly competitive and we compete with many producers who are larger and better capitalized than we are 
we compete principally on price  quality and transportation costs of coal with other coal producers of various sizes 
we have a transportation advantage where our mines are located adjacent to our customers power plants  or where  as with the absaloka mine  we are closer than our competitors to our customers 
our coal also competes with other energy sources in the production of electricity 
factors such as the price of natural gas and the cost of environmental compliance are major considerations in the decision to operate or build and bring on line substantial new coal fired generation 
the price of natural gas has been volatile over the past year ranging from a high of per mmbtu in february to a low of per mmbtu in october and increasing to as of january  henry hub spot making the relative price stability in the coal market a significant contributor to renewed interest in constructing new  environmentally sound coal fired generation 
the rova project generates electricity directly and sell it on a wholesale  long term contract basis to utilities under rates established in power purchase agreements and approved by regulatory agencies 
the independent power industry has grown rapidly over the past twenty years  accelerating in the s due  in part  to electric utility deregulation initiatives 
the principal sources of competition in this market for additional capacity include traditional regulated utilities seeking to maximize utilization of existing capacity  unregulated subsidiaries of regulated utilities  energy brokers and traders  energy service companies in the business of developing  operating  and marketing energy producing projects  equipment suppliers and other non utility generators like our subsidiaries 
competition in this industry is substantially based on price 
the lowest cost generating units will be the most competitive in the market place and will run more frequently 
the deregulation of the energy business could significantly affect us 
throughout the last several years the electrical generation industry has suffered several disruptions  notably the breakdown of deregulation in california  episodic failure of the transmission system in the eastern us and canada and an oversupply of natural gas generation capacity 
as a consequence  interest in building new coal fired generation has increased 
many new generating facilities  including our potential lv project  have been publicly announced 
we anticipate that  as the economy grows  the demand for power will also grow and interest in new generating capacity and transmission should reemerge 
at the national and state level  the debate continues about deregulation of electricity and the creation of competitive markets for wholesale and retail sale of electricity 
system reliability and transmission issues  including wheeling power from one system to another and system constraints insufficient transmission line capacity to add more electricity  are among the factors being analyzed  and the pace at which these problems are solved will affect how quickly competitive power markets may become a reality 
we cannot predict how the market for coal  the independent power business  or the energy industry as a whole might be affected by this debate 
if the coal industry experiences overcapacity in the future  our profitability could be impaired 
during the mid s and early s  a growing coal market and increased demand for coal attracted new investors to the coal industry  spurred the development of new mines and resulted in added production capacity throughout the industry  all of which led to increased competition and lower coal prices 
increases in coal prices similarly could encourage the development of expanded capacity by new or existing coal producers 
any overcapacity could reduce coal prices in the future 
we may be adversely affected by proposed rules regulating mercury and by the proposed interstate air quality rule 
coal contains impurities  including sulfur  mercury and other elements or compounds  many of which are released into the air when coal is burned 
stricter environmental regulations of emissions from coal fired electric generating plants could increase the costs us using coal  thereby  reducing demand for coal as a fuel source and the volume of our coal sales 
stricter regulations could make coal a less attractive fuel alternative in the planning and building of utility power plants in the future 
on january   epa published two major draft rules concerning the regulation of mercury  sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions proposed national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants mercury  and the rule to reduce interstate transport of fine particulate matter and ozone interstate air quality rule  or iaqr 
these draft rules effectively overshadow the bush administration s clear skies initiative and for the affected states  the iaqr replaces epa s state implementation plan call 
epa proposes to regulate for the first time emissions of mercury by electrical generating units  in one of three ways a rigid plant by plant approach commonly referred to as mact  maximum available control technology whereby power plants would have to meet emission standards determined by the rank of coal burned  by  a pure cap and trade approach modeled on title iv of the clean air act and the sulfur dioxide emissions allowance trading program  or a combination of a mact and cap and trade 
the interstate air quality rule is also based on the clean air act 
epa proposes to use a cap and trade program utilizing and modeled on the acid rain program to further reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide in states and the district of columbia  primarily states in the eastern part of the country 
we have operations or customers in states covered by these regulations  and the epa s sulfur dioxide proposal could result in national impacts by utilizing the existing title iv sulfur dioxide allowance market 
air quality in each state is affected by both emissions emanating from activities in that state as well as emissions transported from adjacent states 
the draft rule proposes to regulate both 
epa is accepting comments on the iaqr until march  and on the mercury rules until april  we are currently assessing the potential implications of these rules for our operations 
at this time  we cannot predict the effect of these initiatives on us 
the rova project currently utilizes state of the art emission control technologies and has consistently been rated among the cleanest coal fired power plants in the country 
the rova project is also evaluating its strategies for complying with these proposals  should they be adopted 
the passage of legislation responsive to the framework convention on global climate change or similar international initiatives could result in restrictions on coal use 
the united states and more than other nations are signatories to the framework convention on global climate change which is intended to limit or capture emissions of greenhouse gases  such as carbon dioxide 
in december  in kyoto  japan  the signatories to the convention established a binding set of emissions targets for developed nations 
the united states declined to sign the treaty 
president bush believed that the treaty severely limited the ability of the united states to compete in the global marketplace 
on december   russia announced its decision not to sign the kyoto accord stating that the treaty limited russia s economic growth 
with the russian decision not to sign  the treaty must be renegotiated or it is effectively terminated 
although the specific emissions targets vary from country to country  the united states would be required to reduce emissions to of levels over a five year budget period from through if the kyoto protocol or other comprehensive legislation focusing on greenhouse gas emissions is enacted by the united states  it could have the effect of restricting the use of coal 
other efforts to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and federal initiatives to encourage the use of natural gas also may affect the use of coal as an energy source 
we may be affected by environmental initiatives at the state level 
environmental initiatives by the states may affect our operations 
for example  texas has passed regulations requiring all fossil fuel fired generating facilities in the state to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions to pounds per million btu on an annual average basis beginning in may this standard may be met by the application of new technology  fuel characteristics  or emission credits 
texas genco may assert that the texas nitrogen oxide regulations impact lignite usage at the limestone station 
other states are evaluating various strategies for improving air quality and reducing emissions 
passage of other state specific environmental laws may further affect our operations 
we are monitoring events and issues to evaluate the effects of any new environmental law or regulations 
we have significant reclamation and mine closure obligations 
if the assumptions underlying our accruals are materially inaccurate  we could be required to expend greater amounts than anticipated 
we accrue for the costs of current mine disturbance and of final mine closure 
estimates of our gross reclamation and mine closing liabilities  which are based upon permit requirements and our experience  were million with a present value of million at december  a significant portion of these costs are the financial responsibility of our customers  or have been funded by our customers and the absaloka mine s mining contractor 
our customers have secured a portion of their obligations by posting bonds in the amount of million and funding reclamation escrow accounts in the amount of approximately million  in each case at december   but our obligations will be funded from future operations 
our future results could be affected by our reclamation obligations 
we have significant obligations for long term employee benefits for which we accrue based upon assumptions that  if inaccurate  could result in our being required to expend greater amounts than anticipated 
we provide various long term employee benefits under the coal act and contracts and to our current and former employees 
we accrue amounts for these obligations 
our accruals are estimated based on assumptions that are described above 
however  if our assumptions are inaccurate  we could be required to expend greater amounts than anticipated 
new regulations have expanded the definition of black lung disease and generally made it easier for claimants to assert and prosecute claims  which could increase our exposure to black lung benefit liabilities 
in january  the united states department of labor amended the regulations implementing the federal black lung laws to give greater weight to the opinion of a claimant s treating physician  expand the definition of black lung disease and limit the amount of medical evidence that can be submitted by claimants and respondents 
the amendments also alter administrative procedures for the adjudication of claims  which  according to the department of labor  results in streamlined procedures that are less formal  less adversarial and easier for participants to understand 
these and other changes to the federal black lung regulations could increase our exposure to black lung benefits liabilities 
in recent years  legislation on black lung reform has been introduced but not enacted in congress 
it is possible that this legislation will be reintroduced for consideration by congress 
if any of the proposals included in this or similar legislation is passed  the number of claimants who are awarded benefits could significantly increase 
any such changes in black lung legislation  if approved  may adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our results could be affected if the major maintenance outage at rova i scheduled for lasts longer than we anticipate or by unscheduled outages at the power plants we supply 
our equity in earnings from independent power could be adversely affected if a scheduled outage at rova i lasts longer than we anticipate 
rova i is currently scheduled to be out of service for days for major maintenance in if that maintenance uncovers matters beyond those anticipated  the outage may be prolonged beyond the day period 
rova i s contract with virginia power is structured so that our equity in earnings from independent power will not be adversely affected by a day outage for major maintenance this year  but a prolonged outage could adversely affect our equity in earnings from independent power 
our coal sales may be adversely affected by unscheduled outages at the power plants we supply 
we cannot anticipate if or when unscheduled outages may occur 
increases in fuel  electricity and materials costs could affect our profitability 
under several of our existing coal supply agreements  our mines bear the cost of the gasoline  lubricants and other petroleum products  electricity  and other materials and supplies necessary to operate their draglines and other mobile equipment 
the prices of certain of these commodities have increased in the last year  and continued escalation of these costs could affect our profitability 
we face significant capital expenditures in the next several years 
the coal mines we own incur capital expenditures for the equipment necessary to maintain operations and need to make large investments in development costs to expand mining operations into new areas of each mine 
the actual costs could exceed estimates and infringe upon our available cash 
we depend on key personnel 
the loss of key senior management personnel could adversely affect us 
we depend on the continued services and performance of senior management and other key personnel  particularly christopher k 
seglem  chairman of the board  president and chief executive officer 
we do not have key person life insurance policies 
the unexpected loss of any of our executive officers or other key employees could harm our business 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk  including the effects of changes in commodity prices as discussed below 
commodity price risk the company  through its subsidiaries wri and wml  produces and sells coal to third parties from coal mining operations in montana  texas and north dakota and through its subsidiary  wellc  produces and sells electricity and steam to third parties from its independent power projects located in north carolina and colorado 
nearly all of the company s coal production and all of its electricity and steam production are sold through long term contracts with customers 
these long term contracts serve to minimize the company s exposure to changes in commodity prices although some of the company s contracts are adjusted periodically based upon market prices 
the company has not entered into derivative contracts to manage its exposure to changes in commodity prices  and was not a party to any such contracts at december interest rate risk the company and its subsidiaries are subject to interest rate risk on its debt obligations 
long term debt obligations have both fixed and variable interest rates  and the company s revolving line of credit has a variable rate of interest indexed to either the prime rate or libor 
interest rates on these instruments approximate current market rates as of december  based on the balances outstanding as of december   a one percent change in the prime interest rate or libor would increase interest expense by  on an annual basis 
the company s heritage health benefit costs are also impacted by interest rate changes because its pension  pneumoconiosis and post retirement medical benefit obligations are recorded on a discounted basis
