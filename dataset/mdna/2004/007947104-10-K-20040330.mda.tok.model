item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations three year comparison change change net sales cost of goods sold of net sales gross margin of net sales selling and administrative costs of net sales legal settlement research and development subtotal of net sales operating income of net sales other income expense insurance proceeds related to lost income gain loss on disposition of equipment net interest expense income loss before extraordinary item and accrued premium on preferred stock of net sales extraordinary gain on involuntary conversion of non monetary assets due to fire income before accrued premium on preferred stock of net sales accrued premium on preferred stock net income applicable to common stock of net sales net sales change change springdale facility junction facility total net sales year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales increased in to million from million in increased national demand for our choicedek premium products and additional production capacity caused net sales at the springdale facility to increase to million from million in net sales in the junction facility decreased from million in to million in due to the major fire in march that temporarily shut down plant operations 
the facility resumed operations with one extrusion line in may  and we have been operating at capacity since then 
as previously discussed in item business operations  we are now rebuilding the second line and the material transfer system 
we plan to have junction fully rebuilt by the end of the second quarter of 
table of contents cost of goods sold our cost of goods sold  as a percent of sales  increased significantly in versus primarily due to the rising cost of acquiring recyclable plastics 
a sharp increase in petroleum prices early in the year drove up virgin resin prices  which caused industrial consumers to turn to recycled plastics  which then forced up the price that we had to pay for waste plastic 
to help offset rising material costs  we are expanding the plastic recovery process capacity at the second northwest arkansas facility and seeking new sources of waste plastic materials 
selling and administrative expenses the increase in selling and administrative costs as a percentage of sales from in to in is the result of the decrease in revenue at the junction facility  the additional sales staff and increased marketing and brand building expenses related to decking sales 
income income before the extraordinary gain decreased from to primarily because we had to pay more for raw materials  junction sales fell due to the fire  and we experienced delays in automating portions of our production process 
additionally  net interest expense increased approximately  in over  due primarily to the completion of the bond financing in the fourth quarter of  which resulted in higher interest costs and the write off of debt issuance costs related to the arkansas state bank loan see note to the financial statements 
extraordinary item there were no extraordinary items in the extraordinary event in was the major fire at the junction facility 
the junction facility was  and is  fully insured 
damage caused by the fire required us to write down gross assets by approximately million 
we simultaneously adjusted accumulated depreciation on those assets by million  resulting in a net book value decrease in assets of about  at december   we had invested approximately million in reconstructing the junction facility 
insurance proceeds received to reimburse costs incurred to reconstruct the facility resulted in a gain of  through december  additionally  we received  in business interruption insurance during  including  to replace lost income and  to cover fixed expenses 
at december   approximately  was included in accounts receivable for expected insurance reimbursements 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales net sales increased in versus the increase in sales were primarily at the springdale facility  which produces choicedek premium 
sales were driven by higher demand for the choicedek premium decking 
sales at the junction facility increased slightly in  up over 
table of contents cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales  cost of goods sold decreased in as compared to in  the cost of raw material decreased and was the major contributor to the lower cost 
however  in the last quarter of  the cost of acquiring plastics began to increase 
we began to increase our internal capacity to lessen our dependence on third party processors for our plastic 
selling and administrative costs selling and administrative costs were approximately million in  an increase of approximately  from  which is a decrease in total selling and administrative costs as a percentage of sales 
net income the increase in net income  when comparing to  was due to higher sales and slower growth in operating costs 
we believe increased production and sales  improved product focus  increased job training  and increased throughputs have allowed us to attain and increase profitability 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had a working capital deficit of million compared to a working capital deficit of million at december  excluding the million spent to reconstruct the junction facility  we spent approximately million on capital expansion during expenditures were primarily for improving our equipment at both production facilities in the areas of extrusion  raw material processing and plastic production 
although the refinancing decreased the working capital deficit  it was not eliminated because our gross margin and profitability fell and we continued to fund capital improvements through cash flow and short term loans 
as of december   the working capital deficit involved total current liabilities of approximately million  of which million was for miscellaneous accrued liabilities  million was in payables and million was a combination of short term notes payable and the current portion of long term debt 
the million working capital deficit reflects management s decision to enter into short term debt financing to build and improve production and sales capacities to increase cash flows from operations 
our plan continues to be using short term debt  which can be refinanced in the future  rather than more expensive and dilutive equity financing 
on october   we finalized a long term financing package with the city of springdale  arkansas and allstate insurance company that resulted in the release to us of most of the funds previously held in the restricted bond escrow fund and terminating such escrow agreement 
the package consists of million tax exempt industrial development bonds and a million loan that is subordinated to the bonds 
net proceeds from the financing were used to repay short term loans  pay down accounts payable incurred to develop qualified solid waste disposal facilities  purchase the springdale  arkansas extrusion facility  purchase the lowell  arkansas plastic facility  pay issuance fees and provide limited capital for further expansion 
the obligations are secured by substantially all of our real estate assets and personal property  although provision is made for us to incur additional working capital lines of credit subject to compliance with financial covenants that would be secured by 
table of contents accounts receivable and inventory on a basis senior to obligations 
marjorie s

cash increased  to  in significant components of that increase were i cash provided by operating activities of  which consisted of the net income for the period of  increased by depreciation and amortization of  and decreased by other uses of cash of  ii cash used in investing activities of  and iii cash provided by financing activities of  payments on notes during the period were  and proceeds from the issuances of notes amounted to  at december   we had bonds and notes payable in the amount of  of which  was current notes payable and the current portion of long term debt 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported on our financial statements 
the estimates made in applying the accounting policies described below are material to the financial statements and notes thereto due to the level of judgment involved in arriving at those estimates 
accounts receivable trade accounts receivable are stated at the amount management expects to collect from outstanding balances 
delinquency fees are not assessed 
payments of accounts receivable are allocated to the specific invoices identified on the customers remittance advice 
accounts receivable are carried at the original invoice amount less an estimated reserve made for returns and discounts based on quarterly review of historical rates of returns and expected discounts to be taken 
the carrying amount of accounts receivable is reduced  if needed  by a valuation allowance that reflects management s best estimate of the amounts that will not be collected 
management individually reviews all accounts receivable balances that exceed sixty days from invoice date and based on an assessment of current creditworthiness  estimates the portion  if any  of the balance that will not be collected 
management provides for probable uncollectible amounts through a charge to earnings and a credit to a valuation based on its assessment of the current status of the individual accounts 
balances that remain outstanding after management has used reasonable collection efforts are written off through a charge to the valuation allowance and a credit to trade accounts receivable 
changes in the valuation allowance have not been material to the financial statements 
recoveries of trade receivables previously written off are recorded when received 
inventories we state inventories at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
our inventories are not prone to obsolescence  and therefore we have not included a reserve for obsolescence in our financial statements 
buildings and equipment property additions and betterments include capitalized interest and acquisition  construction and administrative costs allocable to construction projects and property purchases 
provision for depreciation of buildings and equipment is provided on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
gains or losses on sales or other dispositions of property are credited or charged to income in the period incurred 
repairs and maintenance costs are charged to income in the period incurred  unless it is determined that the useful life of the respective asset has been extended 
we account for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets in accordance with the provisions of the statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
sfas requires an assessment of the recoverability of our investment in long lived assets to be held and used in 
table of contents operations whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
such assessment requires that the future cash flows associated with the long lived assets be estimated over their remaining useful lives and an impairment loss recognized when the future cash flows are less than the carrying value of such assets 
stock based compensation we account for our stock option plans and other stock based compensation under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
 which allows us to use the intrinsic value method of accounting set forth in accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations see note to the financial statements 
accordingly  compensation cost for stock options is measured as the excess  if any  of the quoted market price of our common stock at the date of the grant over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock

we depend on the market for favorable long term mortgage rates to help generate sales of our product for use in the residential construction industry 
should mortgage rates increase substantially  our business could be impacted by a reduction in the residential construction industry 
important raw materials that we purchase are recycled plastic and wood fiber  which are subject to price fluctuations 
we attempt to limit the impact of price increases on these materials by negotiating with each supplier on a term basis
