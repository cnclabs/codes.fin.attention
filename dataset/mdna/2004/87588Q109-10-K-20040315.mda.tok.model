item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview tanox discovers and develops therapeutic monoclonal antibodies to address significant unmet medical needs in the areas of asthma  allergy  inflammation  other diseases affecting the human immune system and infectious diseases 
our products are genetically engineered antibodies that target a specific molecule or antigen 
our first product  xolair  was developed in collaboration with genentech and novartis 
xolair received us fda marketing approval in june   and was launched in the us in july we received million of milestone payments under our collaboration agreements with novartis and genentech upon the fda approval of xolair  million of which is due to our former attorneys under the terms of an adverse arbitration award see note commitments and contingencies 
xolair generated approximately million in us sales in and is being distributed through five specialty pharmacy distributors 
xolair is currently labeled for treatment of adults and adolescents years of age and above with moderate to severe persistent asthma who have a positive skin test or in vitro reactivity to a perennial aeroallergen and whose symptoms are inadequately controlled with inhaled corticosteroids 
xolair has been shown to decrease the incidence of asthma exacerbations in these patients 
safety and efficacy have not been established in other allergic conditions 
clinical trials to test the safety and efficacy of xolair to treat pediatric asthma patients and peanut allergy patients are expected to begin in in  we recorded royalty income of million from sales of xolair 
under our collaboration agreements with genentech and novartis  we receive royalties on the net sales of xolair and will share in novartis net profits from sales of xolair in the united states 
over the next several years  we expect our principal revenues will be royalties and profit sharing payments relating to sales of xolair 
during  we completed a single dose patient phase a trial and a multiple dose patient phase b trial with tnx  an anti cd antibody  in hiv infected patients 
in both trials  the drug was well tolerated in all dose groups mg kg without evidence of cd cell depletion 
in these two open label  monotherapy trials patients were on a failing haart regimen or on no other antiretroviral therapy  transient  clinically important log 
reductions in viral load were observed 
a more definitive assessment of efficacy will depend upon results from a planned phase trial in which patients will be randomized to optimized background therapy obt plus tnx or to obt alone 
subject to drug availability  this phase trial is expected to begin in the first half of on october   the fda granted fast track status designation to tnx critical accounting policies use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and footnotes thereto 
actual results may differ from those estimates 

table of contents revenue recognition revenues from development agreements include payments for milestone achievements and sponsored research and development costs 
milestone payments are received under best efforts contracts and are not refundable 
they are recognized as revenue when the milestones are achieved and there are no remaining performance obligations 
revenues for sponsored research and development are recognized as revenue as we complete our obligations related to such activities 
any revenue contingent upon future performance is deferred and recognized as the performance is completed 
under our collaboration agreements with genentech and novartis  we receive a royalty on the net sales of xolair worldwide and share in novartis net profits from xolair sales in the united states 
royalty income is recorded monthly based on contractual terms and information provided by genentech and novartis 
royalties are reconciled and adjusted if actual results differ from those previously reported to us 
revenues recognized are net of certain milestone credits and amounts due to our former attorneys under the arbitration award 
research and development research and development expenses consist of direct costs and indirect overhead costs  including facilities costs  salaries and related benefit costs and material and supply costs 
expenses may also include upfront fees and milestones paid to licensors and collaborative partners 
such amounts are expensed as incurred 
research and development costs also include estimates for clinical trial costs  which are based on patient enrollment and clinical trial progress 
actual costs may differ from estimates 
results of operations this discussion of our results of operations contains forward looking statements regarding revenue  research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses

years ended december   and total revenues 
our total revenues for were million  a million increase from primarily due to milestone revenue received upon fda approval of xolair and to xolair royalty revenue for the period july through december total revenues for were  a  increase from primarily due to licensing fee revenues 
revenues in were primarily grants 
milestone revenue for included million in milestone revenue associated with the fda approval of xolair in june per our collaboration agreements with novartis and genentech 
this revenue was reduced by million of the genentech milestone payment which is payable to our former attorneys under the arbitration ruling 
royalty revenue of million from the sale of xolair in was net of  payable to our former attorneys under the arbitration award 
research and development expenses 
research and development expense consists of costs incurred for product development and discovery research programs 
the major components of research and development costs include salaries and employee benefits  clinical trial expenses  clinical manufacturing costs  consulting and other third party costs  supplies and materials  equipment depreciation and allocations of various overhead and facilities costs 

table of contents our research and development activities can be divided into clinical stage programs  which currently include tnx and tnx  and research and preclinical stage programs  which include anti factor d  anti ca antibodies and other discovery projects 
the cost associated with research and development programs  including overhead allocation  approximate the following in thousands clinical stage programs research and preclinical stage programs total research and development expenses research and development expenses decreased in compared to by million 
the decrease was primarily due to a winding down of tnx development which was partially offset by increased tnx development activities 
research and development expense increased million in compared to as a result of a significant increase in tnx development in in preparation for phase clinical trials 
spending on research and preclinical stage programs was lower in than in resulting from the closure of our former dutch facility tanox pharma  bv and a reduction of discovery research projects 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million  compared to million in and million in in compared to  general and administrative expense decreased by million due to reduced litigation spending of million and reduced personnel related costs 
this was partially offset by increased directors and officers insurance expense 
general and administrative expenses increased in compared to  primarily due to a million increase in litigation related expenses and recruiting and relocation costs 
restructuring charge 
in june  tanox recorded a million restructuring charge associated with the closure of the research operations of tanox pharma bv see note tanox pharma bv restructuring charge 
during  the estimated cost to complete these activities was reduced by  tanox completed the restructuring activities in april other income expense 
other income decreased to in from million in and million in this decrease was principally due to reduced interest income in compared to and in compared to resulting from lower average interest rates and lower amounts available for investment 
in  other expense also includes a loss of  on the sale of assets associated with closing our taiwan office in may in  higher interest income was offset by a  other than temporary decline in the fair value of an available for sale investment 
income tax benefit 
during the year ended december   we received a refund related to alternative minimum taxes paid in and which we recorded as a credit benefit to our income tax provision 
there was no provision for income taxes in  or  due to pre tax losses of million  million and million  respectively 
these pre tax losses generated a tax benefit  which was fully offset by an increase in tanox s valuation allowance 
net loss 
the net loss decreased to million in or per share  as compared to million or per share in and million or per share in 
table of contents liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations since inception primarily through sales of equity securities  collaboration and grant revenues  interest income and equipment financing agreements 
during the year ended december   we sold  shares of common stock at per share in an initial public offering and received net proceeds of million 
as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and investments  of which million were classified as current assets 
at december   million of cash and investments was pledged against our outstanding borrowings under its line of credit or was deposited with the district court in connection with our appeal of an unfavorable arbitration ruling 
during the year ended december   we used milestone payments  reimbursement of clinical trial expenses  licensing revenue  proceeds from investment maturities  interest income and proceeds from stock option exercises  together with cash and cash equivalents on hand at december   to fund operating activities and capital expenditures 
the combination of the above items and the increase in short and long term investment securities resulted in a net decrease in cash  cash equivalents and investments of  including the restricted amount of million for the year ended december  we have been engaged in litigation in connection with a fee dispute with the law firms that represented us in litigation with genentech relating to  among other things  the intellectual property rights surrounding the development of anti ige technology 
an arbitration panel issued an award entitling the attorneys to receive i approximately million  including interest  ii payments ranging from to of the future milestone payments  in excess of the first million  we would receive from genentech following product approval  and iii of the royalties that we would receive on all sales of certain anti ige products  including xolair 
tanox sought a court order vacating this arbitration award  but a judgment was entered confirming the award  and that judgment was affirmed by the court of appeals  th district of texas 
on october   the texas supreme court denied our petition for review 
during the appeals process  we were required to place amounts in escrow to secure payment of the award  and had escrowed million with the harris county district court as of december  these funds  recorded as restricted cash at december   were released to the former attorneys during february in september  we entered into a million revolving line of credit note agreement with a bank 
under the terms of the agreement  tanox may secure advances up to the aggregate principal amount of million  the proceeds of which can be used to finance the purchase of property  plant and equipment 
the outstanding principal balance is payable in full on september   and advances bear interest at the lesser of the prime rate or libor  the london interbank offered rate  plus 
accrued interest is payable on the last day of each month 
as of december   we had borrowed million under the agreement 
from through  novartis advanced tanox million  pursuant to a loan agreement  to finance our pilot manufacturing facility 
tanox has pledged all of the assets of the pilot manufacturing facility as security for the loan 
the loan bears interest at the libor rate plus 
through december   novartis has agreed to forgive interest on the loan 
subject to modifications agreed to in principle concurrent with completion of the tripartite collaboration among tanox  novartis and genentech in july  the principal and future interest payments may be partially or totally forgiven by novartis based on the future use of the facility 
under the loan agreements  upon activation of the facility for production  tanox is required to make principal and interest payments on the loan in amounts equal to of net cash flow  if any  from the facility 
if the net cash flow payments during the ten years following the date the facility first became operational are not sufficient to repay the principal and accrued interest on the loan  novartis has agreed to forgive the remaining principal and accrued interest 
the facility was activated in and  until october  produced clinical trial materials for tnx during  the facility was used to produce clinical trial materials for tnx accordingly  we have 
table of contents accrued interest of  and  on the loan for and  respectively 
in connection with the settlement of litigation and completion of the collaboration agreements with novartis and genentech in february  the principal and accrued interest on this loan were forgiven in full by novartis see item legal proceedings 
on september   we purchased a  square foot office and warehouse building adjacent to our research and manufacturing facility for million which we are renovating into a research lab and administrative office facility 
on september   we purchased the  square foot research and pilot manufacturing facility in houston  texas that we had been leasing  together with approximately acres of adjacent land  for million 
the million purchase price was funded under the bank line of credit described above 
the draw is collateralized with cash and investments at the bank 
we intend to pursue permanent financing options  including a possible sale and lease back for both buildings 
during the year ended december   we invested approximately million in equipment and facility improvements 
the following table represents tanox s contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period in thousands more less than to to than contractual obligations total year years years years operating leases notes payable purchase obligations and license fees total purchase obligations and license fees include commitments related to capital expenditures  collaboration agreements  manufacturing and research operations 
our current and anticipated development projects require substantial additional capital to complete 
we do not expect to generate positive cash flow from operations until at least because we anticipate that the amount of cash we need to fund operations  including research and development  manufacturing and other costs  and for capital expenditures  will grow in the future as our projects move from research to clinical development to commercialization 
we also expect that we will need to expand our clinical development  manufacturing capacity  facilities  business development and marketing activities to support the future development of our programs 
based on cash projections  we expect that cash on hand and revenue from operations will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next four years 
however  our future capital needs will depend on many factors  including the successful commercialization of xolair  progress in our research and development activities  commercialization activities  the costs and magnitude of product or technology acquisitions  the cost of preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  competing technological and market developments  changes in or terminations of existing collaboration and licensing arrangements  establishing additional collaboration and licensing arrangements  potential merger and acquisition activities  and manufacturing scale up costs and marketing activities  if we undertake those activities 
consequently  we may need to raise additional funds 
we do not have external committed sources of funding and we cannot assure that we will be able to obtain additional funds on acceptable terms  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our programs  obtain funds through arrangements with collaboration partners or others that may require 
table of contents us to relinquish rights to technologies  product candidates or products that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize ourselves  or license rights to technologies  product candidates or products on terms that are less favorable to us than might otherwise be available 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a variety of risks  including changes in interest rates 
in the normal course of business  we have established policies and procedures to manage these risks 
foreign currency exchange rates 
we were subject to foreign currency exchange risk because we conducted operations through two foreign subsidiaries prior to the closing of tanox pharma bv and our taiwan office in interest rate risk 
cash  cash equivalents and investments were approximately million including the restricted cash and investments of million at december  these assets were primarily invested in investment grade corporate bonds and commercial paper with maturities of less than three years  which we have the ability and intent to hold to maturity 
we do not invest in derivative securities 
although our portfolio is subject to fluctuations in interest rates and market conditions  no gain or loss on any security would actually be recognized in earnings unless we sell the asset 
in addition  our bank line of credit and our loan from novartis are based on a premium over libor 
as such  if general interest rates increase  our interest costs will increase
