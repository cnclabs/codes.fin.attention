item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our financial position and results of operations for each year in the three year period ended december  you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements 
for a description of limitations inherent in forward looking statements  see cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements on page ii 
overview and strategy our primary objective is to increase shareholder value of our common stock through increasing reserves  production  cash flow and earnings 
we are shifting the balance of our investments from properties having high rates of production in early years to properties with more consistent production over a longer term 
we attempt to reduce our financial risks by dedicating a smaller portion of our capital to high risk projects  while reserving the majority of our available capital for exploitation and development drilling opportunities 
obtaining positions in long lived oil and gas reserves will be given priority over properties that might provide more cash flow in the early years of production  but which have shorter reserve lives 
we also attempt to further reduce risk by emphasizing acquisition possibilities over high risk exploration projects 
during the latter part of  we reduced our emphasis on high risk exploration efforts and started focusing on established geologic trends where we can utilize the engineering  operational  financial and technical expertise of our entire staff 
although we anticipate participating in exploratory drilling activities in the future  reducing financial  reservoir  drilling and geological risks and diversifying our property portfolio are important criteria in the execution of our business plan 
in summary  our current business plan 
focuses on projects having less geological risk  
emphasizes exploitation and enhancement activities  
focuses on acquiring producing properties  and 
expands the scope of operations by diversifying our exploratory and development efforts  both in and outside of our current areas of operation 
although the direction of our exploration and development activities has shifted from high risk exploratory activities to lower risk development opportunities  we will continue our efforts  as we have in the past  to maintain low general and administrative expenses relative to the size of our overall operations  utilize advanced technologies  serve as operator in appropriate circumstances  and reduce operating costs 
the extent to which we are able to implement and follow through with our business plan will be influenced by 
the prices we receive for the oil and gas we produce  
the results of reprocessing and reinterpreting our d seismic data  
the results of our drilling activities  
the costs of obtaining high quality field services  
our ability to find and consummate acquisition opportunities  and 
our ability to negotiate and enter into work to earn arrangements  joint venture or other similar agreements on terms acceptable to us 
significant changes in the prices we receive for our oil and gas drilling results  or the occurrence of unanticipated events beyond our control may cause us to defer or deviate from our business plan  including the amounts we have budgeted for our activities 
operating performance our operating performance is influenced by several factors  the most significant of which are the prices we receive for our oil and gas and our production volumes 
the world price for oil has overall influence on the prices that we receive for our oil production 
the prices received for different grades of oil are based upon the world price for oil  which is then adjusted based upon the particular grade 
typically  light oil is sold at a premium  while heavy grades of crude are discounted 
gas prices we receive are influenced by 
seasonal demand  
weather  
hurricane conditions in the gulf of mexico  
availability of pipeline transportation to end users  
proximity of our wells to major transportation pipeline infrastructures  and 
to a lesser extent  world oil prices 
additional factors influencing our overall operating performance include 
production expenses  
overhead requirements  and 
costs of capital 
our oil and gas exploration  development and acquisition activities require substantial and continuing capital expenditures 
historically  the sources of financing to fund our capital expenditures have included 
cash flow from operations  
sales of our equity securities  
bank borrowings  and 
industry joint ventures 
depletion per boe in was versus in and in the decrease per boe in was a result of lower cost reserves associated with our acquisition of the fullerton properties as of december  our oil and gas producing activities are accounted for using the full cost method of accounting 
under this accounting method  we capitalize all costs incurred in connection with the acquisition of oil and gas properties and the exploration for and development of oil and gas reserves 
see note to the financial statements 
these costs include lease acquisition costs  geological and geophysical expenditures  costs of drilling productive and non productive wells  and overhead expenses directly related to land and property acquisition and exploration and development activities 
proceeds from the disposition of oil and gas properties are accounted for as a reduction in capitalized costs  with no gain or loss recognized unless a disposition involves a material change in reserves  in which case the gain or loss is recognized 
depletion of the capitalized costs of oil and gas properties  including estimated future development costs  is provided using the equivalent unit of production method based upon estimates of proved oil and gas reserves and production  which are converted to a common unit of measure based upon their relative energy content 
unproved oil and gas properties are not amortized  but are individually assessed for impairment 
the cost of any impaired property is transferred to the balance of oil and gas properties being depleted 
results of operations our business activities are characterized by frequent  and sometimes significant  changes in our 
reserve base  
sources of production  
product mix gas versus oil volumes  and 
the prices we receive for our oil and gas production 
year to year or other periodic comparisons of the results of our operations can be difficult and may not fully and accurately describe our condition 
the following table shows selected operating data for each of the three years ended december  year ended december  in thousands except per unit data production  prices and lifting costs oil bbls natural gas mcf    boe  oil price per bbl natural gas price per mcf boe price average production lifting cost per boe average price received at the wellhead for our oil and natural gas 
the increase in is attributable to increased lifting costs associated with our waterflood projects 
critical accounting policies and practices full cost and impairment of assets 
we account for our oil and natural gas exploration and development activities using the full cost method of accounting 
under this method  all costs incurred in the acquisition  exploration and development of oil and natural gas properties are capitalized 
costs of non producing properties  wells in process of being drilled and significant development projects are excluded from depletion until such time as the related project is developed and proved reserves are established or impairment is determined 
at the end of each quarter  the net capitalized costs of our oil and natural gas properties  as adjusted for asset retirement obligations  is limited to the lower of unamortized cost or a ceiling  based on the present value of estimated future net revenues  net of income tax effects  discounted at  plus the lower of cost of fair market value of our unproved properties 
revenues are measured at unescalated oil and gas prices at the end of each quarter  with effect given to our cash flow hedge positions 
if the net capitalized costs of our oil and gas properties exceed the ceiling  we are subject to a ceiling test write down to the extent of the excess 
a ceiling test write down is a non cash charge to earnings 
it reduces earnings and impacts stockholders equity in the period of occurrence and results in lower depreciation  depletion and amortization expense in future periods 
the risk that we will be required to write down the carrying value of oil and gas properties increases when oil and gas prices decline 
if commodity prices deteriorate  it is possible that we could incur an impairment in future periods 
depletion 
provision for depletion of oil and gas properties  under the full cost method  is calculated using the unit of production method based upon estimates of proved oil and gas reserves with oil and gas production being converted to a common unit of measure based upon their relative energy content 
investments in unproved properties and major development projects are not amortized until proved reserves associated with the projects can be determined or until impairment occurs 
the cost of any impaired property is transferred to the balance of oil and gas properties being depleted 
proved reserve estimates 
our discounted present value of proved oil and natural gas reserves is a major component of the ceiling calculation  and represents the component that requires the most subjective judgments 
estimates of reserves are forecasts based on engineering data  projected future rates of production and the timing of future expenditures 
the process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves requires substantial judgment  resulting in imprecise determinations  particularly for new discoveries 
different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserve quantities based on the same data 
our reserve estimates are prepared by outside consultants 
the passage of time provides more qualitative information regarding estimates of reserves  and revisions are made to prior estimates to reflect updated information 
however  there can be no assurance that more significant revisions will not be necessary in the future 
if future significant revisions are necessary that reduce previously estimated reserve quantities  it could result in a full cost ceiling writedown 
in addition to the impact of these estimates of proved reserves on calculation of the ceiling  estimates of proved reserves are also a significant component of the calculation of depreciation  depletion and amortization 
while the quantities of proved reserves require substantial judgment  the associated prices of oil and natural gas reserves that are included in the discounted present value of the reserves do not require judgment 
accounting principles generally accepted in the united states require that prices and costs in effect as of the last day of the period are held constant indefinitely 
accordingly  the resulting value is not indicative of the true fair value of the reserves 
oil and natural gas prices have historically been cyclical and  on any particular day at the end of a quarter  can be either substantially higher or lower than prices we actually receive in the long term  which are a barometer for true fair value 
use of estimates 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported assets  liabilities  expenses  and some narrative disclosures 
hydrocarbon reserves  future development costs and certain hydrocarbon production expense are the most critical estimates to our financial statements 
derivatives 
the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
and sfas no 
requiring that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their respective values 
sfas no 
and sfas no 
are effective for all fiscal quarters of all fiscal years beginning after june  we adopted sfas no 
and sfas no 
on january  for the periods prior to january   derivative contracts were not designated as hedges 
accordingly  the unrealized gains or losses were recorded in income 
as of january  we designated costless collars  oil and gas swaps  and interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges 
accordingly  the effective portion of the unrealized gain or loss on cash flow hedges is recorded in other comprehensive income until the forecasted transaction occurs 
we continued to record the unrealized loss on put positions outstanding in income during the purpose of our hedges is to provide a measure of stability in our oil and gas prices and interest rate payments and to manage exposure to commodity price and interest rate risk under existing sales contracts 
overhead reimbursement joint operations 
as compensation for administration  supervision office services and warehousing cost  an operator may charge drilling and producing overhead costs based upon rates negotiated in the joint operating agreement 
overhead reimbursements charged to working interest owners for properties that we operate are treated as reductions in general and administrative expense for producing overhead 
for  capital costs were reduced by approximately  and general and administrative costs were reduced by approximately  for drilling and producing overhead reimbursements 
prior to  overhead was recorded as other income 
the amounts reimbursed to us for and were  and  respectively 
years ended december  and december  oil and gas revenues 
our total oil and gas revenues for were million  an increase of million  or approximately  from for the increase in revenues for  compared to  is related to a increase in oil and gas production due to the fullerton acquisition on december   two additional productive wells drilled in in the cook mountain along with a full year s production of the murphy and a increase in the average sales price per boe including hedges 
on an equivalent barrel basis  production totaled million boe compared with  boe in  approximately a  boe increase 
lease operating expense 
the increase in lease operating expense for  compared with  was primarily the result of increased lease operating expense associated with the waterfloods on fullerton and diamond m properties 
lease operating costs increased million or  to million for the twelve months ended december   from million for the same period of general and administrative costs 
overall general and administrative expenses increased million or approximately to million for the year ended december  general and administrative expenses for the same period of were million 
the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to additional personnel in conjunction with the implementation of our new business plan in june and increased public reporting costs 

general and administrative expense included in oil and gas properties is  and million for and respectively 
depreciation depletion and amortization expense 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses for increased million or approximately to million as compared to million in the increase was primarily attributable to the increase in production volumes for the year ended december  and associated depletable property base in connection with our property acquisitions 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses did not increase at a comparable rate to production volume increases because with the addition of the fullerton properties in late  our depreciation  depletion and amortization rate on a boe basis decreased from in to in equity in income of first permian  lp as discussed in note to the financial statements  first permian  lp sold all of its oil and gas properties on april  as the owner of a interest in first permian  we received our prorata share of the net sales proceeds  or million in cash and  shares of common stock of energen corporation 
our pro rata share of the net income and distributions for was million 
incentive awards attributable to the sale of first permian  lp the incentive awards reflect bonus payments made to certain officers and employees in as a result of first permian s sale of all of its assets 
loss on marketable securities 
we recognized a loss in marketable securities for the year ended december  in the amount of approximately  which resulted from our sales of  shares  all of our investment of energen common stock 
this loss represents the difference in energen s stock price of per share at the time of the first permian sale and our realized net price of approximately per share 
change in fair value of derivatives 
we recognized a loss of approximately  for the year ended december  compared to a loss of  for the same period of the loss of  in was attributable to the expiration of put options not designated as cash flow hedges 
the decrease from to is primarily due to our adopting cash flow hedge accounting which allows us to record changes in fair value of contracts designated as cash flow hedges through other comprehensive income until realized 
when realized  we reflect the gain or loss on commodity derivatives designed as cash flow hedges in revenue and on interest rate derivative designated as cash flow hedges in interest expense 
see note to the financial statements 
gain loss in ineffective portion of hedges 
the gain on the ineffective portion of our hedges was  for we did not use hedge accounting for derivatives prior to dividend income 
dividend income during was approximately  associated with our investment in and ownership of energen common stock 
all of our investment in energen stock was sold in interest expense 
interest expense increased million or to million for the year ended december   from approximately  for the same period of this increase was due principally to increased bank borrowings associated with our acquisitions  partially offset by a decrease in the minimum interest rate under our revolving credit facility 
the minimum interest rate decreased from to in december income tax benefit expense deferred 
for the period ended december   we recorded federal and state income tax expense of million and a credit of  which was a reduction of our estimate of state income tax liability  respectively compared to an income tax expense of million and  respectively in see note to the financial statements 
net income 
our net income for was million a decrease of million or approximately compared to million for the decrease was principally due to the gain on sale of first permian  lp and dividend income from the energen stock recognized in other items affecting net income include 
a increase in oil and gas production due to the fullerton acquisition and increased production at cook mountain along with a increase in sales price per boe  
a increase in lease operating expense due to increased production and operating costs associated with water flood projects  
a increase in general and administrative costs due to a full year of our business plan in place  which included increased staffing needs and associated costs 
we are also experiencing increased public reporting costs due to expanded reporting requirements and activity 
years ended december  and december  oil and gas revenues 
our total oil and gas revenues for were million  a decrease of million  or approximately  from million for the decrease in revenues for  compared to  is related to a decline in the average price we received for our oil and natural gas production volumes  and a decline in oil and natural gas production volumes on a boe basis 
on an equivalent barrel basis  production totaled  boe compared with  boe in the decrease in natural gas production was primarily due to production declines  which was partially offset by our drilling activities in lease operating expense 
the decrease in lease operating expenses for  compared with  was primarily the result of decreased production volumes and  to a lesser extent  reduction in ad valorem taxes and other direct operating expenses 
production costs decreased  or  to million for the twelve months ended december   from million for the same period of general and administrative costs 
overall general and administrative expenses increased  or to million for the year ended december  general and administrative expenses for the same period of were million 
the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increased public reporting costs  increased costs associated with our new office and increased staffing for six months ending associated with our new business plan 
general and administrative expense included in oil and gas properties is million and  for and respectively 
depreciation depletion and amortization expense 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses for were slightly lower at million  as compared to million in the decline was attributable to an increase in reserves as of december   which was partially offset by an increase in net depletable property basis 
impairment of oil and gas properties 
we recognized a noncash impairment charge of million in related to our oil and gas reserves and unproved properties 
the impairment of oil and gas assets was primarily the result of significantly lower oil and natural gas prices on both proved and unproved oil and gas properties 
an impairment was not recognized in equity in income of first permian  lp as discussed in note to the financial statements  first permian  lp sold all of its oil and gas properties on april  as the owner of a interest in first permian  we received our prorata share of the net sales proceeds  or million in cash and  shares of common stock of energen corporation 
our pro rata share of the net income and distributions for was million 
incentive awards attributable to the sale of first permian  lp the incentive awards reflect bonus payments made to certain officers and employees in as a result of first permian s sale of all of its assets 
loss on marketable securities 
we recognized a loss in marketable securities in the amount of approximately  which resulted from our sales of  shares  all of our investment  of energen common stock during this loss represents the difference in energen s stock price of per share at the time of the first permian sale and our realized net price of approximately per share 
change in fair value of derivatives 
we also recognized a loss of  which represented the decrease in fair value of our natural gas puts of  and mark to market accounting for approximately  see note to the financial statements 
dividend income 
dividend income during was  associated with our investment in and ownership of energen common stock 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased  or to  for the year ended december   from  for the same period of this decrease was principally a result of a decrease in average borrowings associated with the redeployment of cash from the sale of the energen stock and lower interest rates 
income tax benefit expense deferred 
for the period ended december   we recorded federal and state income tax expense of million and  respectively 
see note to the financial statements 
net income loss 
our income  before preferred stock dividends  was million for the year ended december   compared with a loss of million for the year ended december  in  income of million resulted entirely from the sale of first permian s oil and gas properties  net of incentive awards attributable to first permian s sale of its assets 
other items affecting net income included 
a decrease in oil and gas revenues related to a decline in volumes and average price received  
decreased production costs of approximately primarily related to decreased production volumes and  to a lesser extent  reductions in ad valorem taxes and other direct operating expenses  
increased general and administrative expenses of  increased public reporting costs  increased costs associated with our new office and increased staffing needs associated with our new business plan  and 
non cash charges associated with the sale of energen stock  fair market value of our put options and mark to market of the crude oil swaps 
capital resources and liquidity our capital resources consist primarily of cash flows from our oil and gas properties and bank borrowings supported by our oil and gas reserves 
our level of earnings and cash flows depends on many factors  including the prices we receive for oil and natural gas we produce 
working capital increased or million as of december  compared with december  current assets exceeded current liabilities by million at december  the working capital increase was primarily due to the private placement of million shares of common stock with gross proceeds of million and no current maturities on our revolving credit facility and increased receivables associated with increased oil and gas volumes and prices 
see note the following table summarizes our cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities year ended december  in thousands operating activities    investing activities    financing activities   cash from operating activities in increased million over largely due to increased operating income from the fullerton acquisition  increased production in the cook mountain gas project and increased sales prices in investing and financing activities decreased in compared to primarily as a result of the fullerton acquisition in these declines were partially offset by proceeds from the first permian asset sale also recorded in cash provided from operating activities declined million in compared to primarily due to reduced production and product prices 
investing and financing activities increased in compared to primarily as a result of the fullerton acquisition 
we incurred net property costs of million for the period ended december   primarily for our oil and gas property leasehold acquisition  development  and enhancement activities 
also added to our property basis were asset retirement costs of million for the adoption of sfas see note 
the property leasehold acquisition  development and enhancement activities were financed by the utilization of cash flows provided by operations 
based on our projected oil and gas revenues and related expenses and available bank borrowings  we believe that we will have sufficient capital resources to fund normal operations and capital requirements  interest expense and principal reduction payments on bank debt  if required  and preferred stock dividends 
we continually review and consider alternative methods of financing 
bank borrowings on december   parallel and its subsidiary  parallel  lp  entered into a first amended and restated credit agreement with first american bank  ssb  western national bank and bnp paribas 
the credit facility provides for revolving loans 
this means that we can borrow  repay and reborrow funds drawn under the credit facility 
however  the aggregate amount that we can borrow and have outstanding at any one time is subject to a borrowing base 
the borrowing base calculation is based primarily upon the estimated value of our oil and gas reserves 
generally  we can borrow only up to the borrowing base in effect from time to time 
the borrowing base amount is redetermined by the banks on or about april and october of each year or at other times required by the banks or at our request 
if  as a result of the banks redetermination of the borrowing base  the outstanding principal amount of our loan exceeds the borrowing base  we must either provide additional collateral to the banks or prepay the principal of the note in an amount equal to the excess 
except for the principal payments that may be required because of our outstanding loans being in excess of the borrowing base  interest only is payable monthly 
the credit agreement was amended in september the amendment included 
the deletion of the monthly commitment reduction  a provision that would have required us to begin amortizing our loan beginning august   
the modification of certain financial ratio tests  
an increase in our borrowing base to million  
changes in certain reporting requirements to the banks  and 
the revision of covenants in the credit agreement governing our hedging activities 
the principal amount outstanding under the revolving credit facility was million at december  this facility bears interest at first american bank s base rate or the libor rate  at our election 
generally  first american bank s base rate is equal to the prime rate published in the wall street journal  but not less than 
the libor rate is generally equal to the sum of a the rate designated as british bankers association interest settlement rates and offered on one  two  three or six month interest periods for deposits of million  and b a margin ranging from to  depending upon the outstanding principal amount of the loans 
the interest rate we are required to pay  including the applicable margin  may never be less than 
if the principal amount outstanding is equal to or greater than of the borrowing base established by the banks  the margin is 
if the principal amount outstanding is equal to or greater than  but less than of the borrowing base  the margin is 
if the principal amount outstanding is less than of the borrowing base  the margin is 
in the case of base rate loans  interest is payable on the last day of each month 
in the case of libor loans  interest is payable on the last day of each applicable interest period 
if the total outstanding borrowings under the facility are less than the borrowing base  an unused commitment fee is required to be paid to the bank lenders 
the amount of the fee is 
of the daily average of the unadvanced amount of the borrowing base 
the fee is payable quarterly 
all outstanding principal under the revolving credit facility is due and payable on december  the loan is secured by substantially all of our oil and gas properties  including the properties parallel  lp parallel  llc  a subsidiary of parallel petroleum corporation  guaranteed payment of the loans 
we are highly dependent on bank borrowings to fund our exploration and drilling activities 
the borrowing base calculation is based upon the estimated value of oil and gas reserves 
if our borrowing base declines significantly  our liquidity would be suddenly and materially limited 
if the borrowing base is increased  we are required to pay a fee of 
on the amount of any increase in the borrowing base 
our obligations to the bank are secured by substantially all of our oil and gas properties 
our bank borrowings have been incurred to finance our property acquisition  d seismic surveys  enhancement and drilling activities 
in addition to customary affirmative covenants  the credit agreement contains various restrictive covenants and compliance requirements  including 
maintaining certain financial ratios  
limitations on incurring additional indebtedness  
prohibiting the payment of dividends on our common stock  
limitations on the disposition of assets  and 
prohibiting liens other than in favor of the lenders to exist on any of our properties 
if we have borrowing capacity under our credit agreement  we intend to borrow  repay and reborrow under the revolving credit facility from time to time as necessary  subject to borrowing base limitations  to fund 
interpretation and processing of d seismic survey data

is senior to the common stock with respect to dividends and on liquidation  dissolution or winding up of parallel  
has a liquidation value of per share  plus accrued and unpaid dividends 
commodity price risk management transactions during  we did not use derivative contracts 
for the year ended december   we used mark to market accounting for all our derivative contracts 
as of january  we designated the costless collars  oil and gas swaps and interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges under the provisions of sfas  as amended 
we continued mark to market accounting for our put positions 
the purpose of our hedges is to provide a measure of stability in our oil and gas prices and interest rate payments and to manage exposure to commodity price and interest rate risk 
our objective is to lock in a range of oil and gas prices and a fixed interest rate for certain notional amounts 
under cash flow hedge accounting  the quarterly change in the fair value of the commodity derivatives is recorded in stockholders equity as other comprehensive income loss and then transferred to revenue when the production is sold 
ineffective portions of cash flow hedges changes in realized prices that do not match the changes in the hedge price are recognized in other expense as they occur 
while the cash flow hedge contract is open  the ineffective gain or loss many increase or decrease until settlement of the contract 
under cash flow hedge accounting for interest rate swaps  the quarterly change in the fair value of the derivatives is recorded in stockholders equity as other comprehensive income loss and then transferred to interest expense when the contract settles 
ineffective portions of cash flow hedges are recognized in other expense as they occur 
we are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by the counterparty in its derivative instruments 
however  we periodically assess the creditworthiness of the counterparty to mitigate this credit risk 
certain of our commodity price risk management arrangements have required us to deliver cash collateral or other assurances of performance to the counterparties in the event that our payment obligations with respect to our commodity price risk management transactions exceed certain levels 
for additional information about our price risk management transactions  see item a of this annual report on form k  beginning on page future capital requirements our capital expenditure budget for is approximately million and is highly dependent on future oil and gas prices and the availability of funding 
these expenditures will be governed by the following factors 
internally generated cash flows  
availability of borrowing under our revolving credit facility  
additional sources of financing  and 
future drilling successes 
in  we have focused on drilling lower risk natural gas prospects that could have a meaningful effect on our reserve base and cash flows 
in selected cases  we may elect to reduce our interest in higher risk  higher impact projects 
we may also sell certain non core producing properties to raise funds for capital expenditures 
contractual obligations  commitments and off balance sheet arrangements we have contractual obligations and commitments that may affect our financial position 
however  based on our assessment of the provisions and circumstances of our contractual obligation and commitments  we do not feel there would be an adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations  financial condition or liquidity 
the following table is a summary of significant contractual obligations obligation due in period after contractual cash obligations years total in thousands revolving credit facility secured   office lease dinero plaza preferred stock dividend  other long term liabilities  derivative obligations    total     assets retirement obligations of oil and natural gas assets  excluding salvage value 
payments of preferred dividends so long as preferred stock remains outstanding and not converted 
deferred taxes are not included in the table above 
the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards combined with our plans for development and acquisitions may offset any major cash outflows 
however  the ultimate timing of the settlements cannot be precisely determined 
purchase obligations are not included in the table because they are not considered material 
in addition to our principal payment obligations under the revolving credit facility payment noted in the table above  we are subject to interest payments on such indebtedness 
see note to the financial statements 
we have no off balance sheet financing arrangements or any unconsolidated special purpose entities 
outlook the oil and gas industry is capital intensive 
we make  and anticipate that we will continue to make  substantial capital expenditures in the exploration for  development and acquisition of oil and gas reserves 
historically  our capital expenditures have been financed primarily with 
internally generated cash from operations  
proceeds from bank borrowings  and 
proceeds from sales of equity securities 
the continued availability of these capital sources depends upon a number of variables  including 
our proved reserves  
the volumes of oil and gas we produce from existing wells  
the prices at which we sell oil and gas  and 
our ability to acquire  locate and produce new reserves 
each of these variables materially affects our borrowing capacity 
we may from time to time seek additional financing in the form of 
increased bank borrowings  
sales of parallel s securities  
sales of non core properties  or 
other forms of financing 
we do not have agreements for any future financing and there can be no assurance as to the availability or terms of any such financing 
inflation inflation has not had a significant impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
we do not believe that inflation poses a material risk to our business 
recent accounting pronouncements fin no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of other 
fin no 
requires that a liability be recorded in the guarantor s balance sheet upon issuance of certain guarantees 
initial recognition and measurement of the liability will be applied on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  fin no 
also requires disclosures about guarantees in financial statements for interim or annual periods ending after december  the adoption of fin no 
did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
fin no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
in december  the fasb issued interpretation no 
r  consolidation of variable interest entities fin  which requires the consolidation of certain entities that are determined to be variable interest entities vie 
an entity is considered to be a vie when either i the entity lacks sufficient equity to carry on its principal operations  ii the equity owners of the entity cannot make decisions about the entity s activities or iii the entity s equity neither absorbs losses or benefits from gains 
the company owns no interests in variable interest entities  and therefore this new interpretation has not affected the company s consolidated financial statements 
in march  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  which amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas no 
provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
as of september   the company adopted the prospective method which applies prospectively the fair value recognition method to all employee and director awards granted  modified or settled after the beginning of the fiscal year in which the fair value based method of accounting for stock based compensation is adopted 
sfas also amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
in april   the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities  which clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the statement is effective for contracts entered into or modified after june  the adoption of sfas did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in may   the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
this statement establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
this statement was effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise was effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  the adoption of sfas did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
a reporting issue has arisen regarding the application of certain provisions of sfas no 
and sfas no 
to companies in the extractive industries  including oil and gas companies 
the issue is whether sfas no 
requires registrants to classify the costs of mineral rights held under lease or other contractual arrangements associated with extracting oil and gas as intangible assets in the balance sheet  apart from other capitalized oil and gas property costs  and provide specific footnote disclosures 
historically  parallel has included the costs of such mineral rights associated with extracting oil and gas as a component of oil and gas properties 
if it is ultimately determined that sfas no 
requires oil and gas companies to classify costs of mineral rights held under lease or other contractual arrangement associated with extracting oil and gas as a separate intangible assets line item on the balance sheet  the company would be required to reclassify approximately million at december  and million at december  out of oil and gas properties and into a separate intangible assets line item 
parallel s cash flows and results of operations would not be affected since such intangible assets would continue to be depleted and assessed for impairment in accordance with full cost accounting rules 
effects of derivative instruments for the year ended december   we used mark to market accounting for all our derivative contracts 
as of january  we designated the costless collars  oil and gas swaps and interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges under the provisions of sfas  as amended 
the adoption of cash flow hedge accounting allows us to record changes in fair value of contracts designated as cash flow hedges through other comprehensive income until realized 
when realized  we reflect the gain or loss on commodity derivatives designated as cash flow hedges in revenue and on interest rate derivatives designated as cash flow hedges in interest expense 
we continued mark to market accounting for our put positions 
the purpose of our hedges is to provide a measure of stability in our oil and gas prices and interest rate payments and to manage exposure to commodity price and interest rate risk 
our objective is to lock in a range of oil and gas prices and a fixed interest rate for certain notional amounts 
under cash flow hedge accounting  the quarterly change in the fair value of the derivatives is recorded in stockholders equity as other comprehensive income loss and then transferred to earnings when the production is sold 
ineffective portions of cash flow hedges changes in realized prices that do not match the changes in the hedge price are recognized in other expense as they occur 
while the cash flow hedge contract is open  the ineffective gain or loss many increase or decrease until settlement of the contract 
we are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by the counterparty in its derivative instruments 
however  we periodically assess the creditworthiness of the counterparty to mitigate this credit risk 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following quantitative and qualitative information is provided about market risks and derivative instruments to which parallel was a party at december   and from which parallel may incur future earnings  gains or losses from changes in market interest rates and oil and natural gas prices 
interest rate sensitivity as of december  our only financial instrument sensitive to changes in interest rates is our bank debt 
as the interest rate is variable and reflects current market conditions  the carrying value approximates the fair value 
the table below shows principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
weighted average interest rates were determined using weighted average interest paid and accrued in december  you should read note to the financial statements for further discussion of our debt that is sensitive to interest rates 
total in thousands  except interest rates variable rate debt   revolving facility secured average interest rate at december   we had bank loans in the amount of approximately million outstanding at an average interest rate of 
borrowings under our credit facility bear interest  at our election  at i the bank s base rate or ii the libor rate  plus libor margin  but in no event less than 
as a result  our annual interest cost in will fluctuate based on short term interest rates 
as the interest rate is variable and is reflective of current market conditions  the carrying value approximates the fair value 
under our credit facility  we may elect an interest rate based upon the agent lender s base lending rate  or the libor rate  plus a margin ranging from to per annum  depending on our borrowing base usage 
the interest rate we are required to pay  including the applicable margin  may never be less than 
in january   we entered into a month libor fixed interest rate swap contract with bnp paribas 
we will receive fixed day libor interest rates for the month period beginning march  through december  a recap for the period of time  notional amounts  libor fixed interest rates  expected margin rates and expected fixed interest rates for the contract are as follows libor expected expected period of time notional amounts fixed interest rates margin rates fixed interest rates dec  thru dec   dec  thru dec   dec  thru dec   based on the anticipated principal reductions under our credit facility

commodity price sensitivity as of december  our major market risk exposure is in the pricing applicable to our oil and natural gas production 
market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in oil and natural gas prices 
realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing domestic price for crude oil and spot prices applicable to the region in which we produce natural gas 
historically  prices received for oil and gas production have been volatile and unpredictable 
we expect pricing volatility to continue 
oil prices ranged from a low of per barrel to a high of per barrel during natural gas prices we received during ranged from a low of per mcf to a high of per mcf 
a significant decline in the prices of oil or natural gas could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
put options 
on may  we purchased put floors on volumes of  mcf per month for a total of  mcf during the seven month period from april through october at a floor price of per mcf for a total consideration of  these derivatives are not held for trading purposes 
a decrease in fair value of the put floors of approximately  was recognized for the period ended december  in our consolidated statements of operations 
costless collar 
collars are created by purchasing puts to establish a floor price and then selling a call which establishes a maximum amount the producer will receive for the oil or gas hedged 
calls are sold to offset or reduce the premium paid for buying the put 
we did not have any collars in place during in  we entered into several costless  seven month houston ship channel gas collars 
a majority of our natural gas production is sold based on houston ship channel prices 
a recap for the period of time  number of mmbtu s and gas prices is as follows houston ship channel gas prices mmbtu of period of time natural gas floor cap january  thru march   april thru october   swaps 
generally  swaps are an agreement to buy or sell a specified commodity for delivery in the future  but at an agreed fixed price 
swap transactions convert a floating price into a fixed price 
for any particular swap transaction  the counterparty is required to make a payment to the hedge party if the reference price for any settlement period is less than the swap price for such hedge  and the hedge party is required to make a payment to the counterparty if the reference price for any settlement period is greater than the swap price for such hedge 
in  we entered into oil and gas swap contracts with bnp paribas 
a recap for the period of time  number of mmbtu s  number of barrels  and swap prices are as follows barrels houston ship of nymex oil mmbtu of channel period of time oil swap price natural gas gas swap price january  thru december   april  thru december   january  thru december   january  thru march   january  thru december
