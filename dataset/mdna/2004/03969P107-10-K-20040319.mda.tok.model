item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this form k 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
the actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including but not limited to those set forth under factors that could affect future results 
all forward looking statements included in this document are based on information available to us on the date of this document and we assume no obligation to update any forward looking statements contained in this form k 
overview intrabiotics pharmaceuticals  inc is a biopharmaceutical company currently focused on the development of an oral solution of iseganan hydrochloride iseganan hcl  an antimicrobial drug  for the prevention of ventilator associated pneumonia vap 
vap is a bacterial pneumonia that can develop in patients receiving mechanical artificial ventilation and is the most common infection occurring in patients in intensive care units 
in september  we launched the first of two pivotal trials of iseganan hc oral solution for the prevention of vap 
the us food and drug administration fda have granted fast track designation status and a special protocol assessment agreement spa on the design of the two pivotal efficacy trials for this indication 
the fast track designation is intended to facilitate the development and expedite the review of a new drug that is intended to treat a serious or life threatening condition  and that demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need 
the spa agreement specifies in writing the pivotal clinical trial requirements for registration of iseganan hcl for the prevention of vap 
under our spa  we are required to conduct two identical pivotal  randomized  double blind  placebo controlled  multinational clinical trials 
we expect to announce the results of the first pivotal trial by the end of our research and development expenses are expected to at least double in as compared to  primarily as a result of the costs associated with the first pivotal trial 
if this trial is successful  we will then conduct the second pivotal trial to support registration of iseganan hcl 
a product s completion date and completion costs are difficult to predict  and delays may be caused by many factors  including slower than expected rate of patient enrollment  our inability to adequately obtain data about patients after their treatment in our clinical trials  additional regulatory requests  inability to manufacture sufficient quantities of materials used for clinical trials  the failure by contract research organizations to appropriately manage clinical trials  or unforeseen safety issues 
as a result  our research and development expenses may fluctuate significantly  and past trends are not indicative of future spending 
we will need to raise substantial additional funds to continue our operations  complete the second pivotal efficacy trial of iseganan hcl for vap  complete the fda approval process  and commence commercialization 
we cannot be certain that the results of either of the two pivotal trials for vap or trials for other indications will be successful  and product revenues may only be generated if we receive the required regulatory approvals and can successfully commercialize a product 
our cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash and short term investments totaled million as of december   including the proceeds of two private placements during in may we completed a preferred stock placement resulting in net cash proceeds of million  and in october we completed a common stock placement resulting in net cash proceeds of million 
the primary purpose of the financings was to provide additional funding for the two pivotal trials of iseganan hcl for the prevention of vap  as well as for other general corporate purposes and working capital 
as of december   the company has received and accepted over eight kilograms of finished iseganan hcl drug substance  which was booked to research and development expense in in accordance with our standard accounting practices 
the quantity is sufficient to complete the two pivotal clinical trials of 
table of contents iseganan hcl for the prevention of vap  but further quantities will be required to validate the manufacturing process  and for commercial use if we successfully obtain fda registration for this indication 
in  we wrote off million of prepaid iseganan hc drug substance to research and development expense  relating to an order of seven kilograms of drug substance that was expected to be delivered in  but that we have not yet been satisfied was manufactured in accordance with a validation plan or that related documentation is adequate 
we are currently discussing this matter with our contract manufacturer  and the write off was recorded due to significant uncertainty over the timing and outcome of these discussions 
in  we recorded non cash stock compensation expense of approximately million for  unexercised stock options that were cancelled and re granted in a one for one exchange and  options that were re granted in connection with the cancellation of  unexercised stock options in february  upon approval by the board of directors 
the re granted options have an exercise price equal to the closing price of the company s common stock on the nasdaq national market on february   or per share 
the options generally vest over a four year period and will expire in february if not previously exercised 
variable accounting is being applied to the re granted options throughout their term 
the related compensation expense depends on both the cumulative vesting of outstanding options and the price of the company s common stock at each quarter end  and therefore may have a significant impact on the company s future results of operations 
on april   the company s stockholders authorized a for reverse stock split of all outstanding shares of the company s common stock  which was effected on april  all share and per share amounts have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split for all periods presented 
we intend that the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations will provide information to assist in the understanding of our financial statements  the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year  and the primary factors that accounted for those changes  as well as how certain accounting principles  policies and estimates affect our financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates general our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and expenses  and related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate these estimates  including those related to clinical trial accruals and stock based compensation 
estimates are based on historical experience  information received from third parties and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could therefore differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact the financial statements 
management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect its more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the financial statements 
clinical trial accruals the company s accrued costs for clinical trial activities are based upon estimates of the services received and related expenses incurred that have yet to be invoiced by the contract research organizations cros  investigators  drug processors  laboratories  consultants  or other clinical trial service providers that perform the activities 
related contracts vary significantly in length  and may be for a fixed amount  a variable amount 
table of contents based on actual costs incurred  capped at a certain limit  or for a combination of these elements 
activity levels are monitored through close communication with the service provider  including detailed invoice and task completion review  analysis of expenses against budgeted amounts  and pre approval of any changes in scope of the services to be performed 
each cro provides an estimate of costs incurred but not invoiced at the end of each period for each individual trial 
the estimates are reviewed and discussed with the cro as necessary  and included in research and development expenses for the related period 
for investigator study grants  which are paid quarterly on a per patient basis to the institutions performing the clinical study  the company accrues an estimated amount based on patient enrollment in each quarter 
all estimates may differ significantly from the actual amount subsequently invoiced 
no adjustments for material changes in estimates have been recognized in any period presented 
stock based compensation in february  the board of directors approved a cancellation and re grant of  unexercised stock options held by existing employees and directors of the company in a one for one exchange and  options that were re granted in connection with the cancellation of  unexercised stock options held by a director of the company 
the options generally vest over a four year period and will expire in february if not previously exercised 
variable accounting is being applied to the re granted options throughout their term 
the related compensation expense depends on both the cumulative vesting of outstanding options and the price of the company s common stock at each quarter end  and therefore may have a significant impact on the company s future results of operations 
no adjustments for material changes in estimates have been recognized in any period presented 
as permitted by statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by statement of financial standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  the company has elected to follow apb and related interpretations in accounting for stock based employee compensation 
under apb  if the exercise price of an employee or director stock option is set equal or in excess of the fair market value of the underlying stock on the date of grant  no compensation expense is recognized 
in february  certain employee and director stock options for which the exercise prices had originally been set at less than the fair market value of the underlying stock on the grant date  were cancelled and re granted in a one for one exchange 
the company had recorded deferred compensation for the difference between the original exercise price and the fair market value of the underlying stock on the grant date as a component of stockholders equity  and the total was being amortized on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the original awards  ranging from four to six years 
the related re granted options all vest over a four year period  and the remaining unamortized deferred compensation as of the re grant date is now being amortized over the new four year vesting schedule  commencing at the date of re grant 
the amount of deferred stock compensation expense to be recorded in future periods could decrease if options  for which accrued but unvested compensation has been recognized  are forfeited prior to vesting 
no adjustments for material changes in estimates have been recognized in any period presented 
options or stock awards issued to non employees are recorded at their fair value as determined in accordance with sfas and the fasb s emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services  and are recognized over the related service period and are periodically re measured as the underlying options vest 
the fair values are estimated using the black scholes option pricing model  and are periodically re measured as the underlying options vest 
the option pricing model is dependent on a number of inputs  which may change over time 
other option pricing models may produce fair values that are substantially different from the black scholes model 
no adjustments for material changes in estimates have been recognized in any period presented 

table of contents results of operations comparison of years ended december   and revenues intrabiotics had no product sales or contract revenue for the years ended december   and we do not anticipate any product revenues until we obtain fda approval for  and commence commercialization of  any product candidate 
expenses research and development change change in thousands research and development research and development expenses primarily include clinical trial expenses  research and development payroll expense  drug substance expense  allocated facilities costs and non cash stock compensation charges 
research and development expenses decreased in by million from  primarily due to a million reduction in clinical trial expenses and a million reduction in research and development payroll expense  allocated facilities costs and non cash stock compensation charges as a result of restructuring activities in the clinical trial expenses of million in relate to the first pivotal trial of iseganan hc for the prevention of vap  which commenced in september in and  clinical trial expenses of million and million  respectively  primarily related to studies of iseganan hcl for oral mucositis  an indication that we are no longer pursuing 
research and development expenses decreased in by million from  primarily due to reductions of million in research and development payroll expense  million in outside services related to clinical trials and million in license fees 
in  research and development expenses include a write off of million for prepaid iseganan hc drug substance  relating to an order of seven kilograms of iseganan hcl bulk drug substance that was expected to be delivered in we have not yet been satisfied that the lot was manufactured in accordance with a validation plan or that related documentation is adequate  and we are currently discussing this with our contract manufacturer 
due to significant uncertainty over the timing and outcome of these discussions  the entire million prepaid amount was written off in september in  research and development expenses included a million charge in relation to the delivery of certain other lots of iseganan hcl bulk drug substance as a result of the termination of a supply agreement with the same contract manufacturer 
a discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with the manufacture of drug substance and drug product is set forth in the factors that could affect future results  under the heading we will be dependent on third party contract manufacturers for the future production of iseganan hcl and for producing information required to register iseganan hcl with the fda if our trials are successful 
if our manufacturing partners fail to manufacture iseganan hcl in accordance with set specifications or fail to produce the necessary information  our operations and related results could be adversely affected 
non cash stock compensation charges were   and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decreases between each period are primarily due to the cancellation of options for terminated employees and consultants 
we expect research and development expenses to at least double in compared to as patients continue to be enrolled in the first pivotal trial of iseganan hcl for the prevention of vap  which is currently our primarily focus 
drug development in the united states is a process that includes several steps defined by the fda 
the process begins with the filing of an investigational new drug ind application that  if successful  allows clinical study of the potential new drug 
clinical development typically involves three phases of study phase i  ii and iii 
pivotal trials are trials that are suitable for submission to the fda for regulatory approval  and generally comprise either phase ii iii or phase iii trials 
the most significant costs associated with 
table of contents clinical development are for phase iii trials  as they tend to be the longest and largest studies conducted during the drug development process 
after completion of clinical trials  a new drug application nda may be filed with the fda 
in responding to an nda  the fda may grant marketing approval  request additional information or deny the application if it determines that the application does not provide an adequate basis for approval 
the lengthy process of seeking regulatory approvals  and the subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations  require the expenditure of substantial resources 
any failure by us to obtain  or any delay in obtaining  regulatory approvals could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
a discussion of the related risks and uncertainties are set forth in the factors that could affect future results under the heading if we fail to complete any clinical trial  or fail to obtain fda approval for any product candidate that we develop  acquire or license  we may never achieve profitability and we may have to cease operations 
general and administrative change change in thousands general and administrative general and administrative expenses in decreased by million from  primarily due to reduced headcount and facility related costs as a result of a restructuring in october the decrease in of  from was primarily attributed to the reduction in headcount as a result of a restructuring implemented in may  partially offset by the acquisition of apothogen in april  which increased general and administrative headcount  and a  charge in conjunction with the termination of two property leases in the fourth quarter of we expect total general and administrative expenses to be similar in compared to  although a number of factors may significantly impact the total expense in  including the impact of changes in our stock price on non cash stock compensation charges 
a discussion of the related risks and uncertainties are set forth in the factors that could affect future results under the heading the change in our stock price over time may significantly impact our results of operations through certain stock compensation charges that depend upon our closing stock price at the end of each quarter 
general and administrative costs primarily include administrative payroll expense  outside contractors  legal and accounting fees  insurance  non cash stock compensation charges  facilities  travel and other general administrative expenses 
non cash stock compensation charges were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
restructuring and other charges change change in thousands restructuring and other charges there were no restructurings during in  restructuring expenses were primarily comprised of million as a result of a facilities lease termination agreement and  of severance costs as a result of a restructuring in october due to the failure of two phase iii clinical trials 
the restructuring reduced our headcount to as of december  from as of december  the million lease termination expense included cash payments  the issuance of common stock and the write off of a deferred rent balance 
of the  severance costs   was paid in and the remaining  was paid in january restructuring charges of million were recorded in resulting from a restructuring plan implemented in may in order to conserve capital and focus resources on the development of iseganan hcl 
the restructuring charges included asset write down charges of million  costs related to work force reduction of million  termination costs for collaboration agreements of million and facilities consolidation costs of million 

table of contents the workforce reduction comprised employees  who were all terminated in  representing a reduction in force 
the estimated cost of terminating the collaboration agreements was increased by  in the fourth quarter of and  in the facilities consolidation costs related to the vacating of three facilities in mountain view  california  totaling  square feet 
one of the vacated facilities was subleased during  the second was terminated in october and the third in january in  an adjustment was made to increase restructuring charges associated with facilities consolidation by million for additional costs related to the third vacated facility 
in november  we reached agreements with the landlords of this building and the facility  which we had subleased  to terminate the leases 
the additional expense recorded during was million and included cash payments  the issuance of common stock and the write off of a deferred rent balance 
additionally as a part of the may restructuring plan  we wrote down to estimated fair value million of leasehold improvements  laboratory equipment  computers and other assets that were no longer being used 
in the fourth quarter of we received proceeds from the disposition of certain leasehold improvements and other assets previously written down in excess of the amounts originally estimated 
as a result  we recognized a gain of million that offset restructuring and other charges in the statement of operations for arbitration settlement during the year ended december   we received million from a contract vendor as a result of an arbitration settlement relating to a drug dispensing error in a phase iii trial of iseganan hcl for oral mucositis 
we had no comparable item in or interest income and expense change change in thousands interest income interest expense interest income decreased in both and  primarily resulting from decreases in average interest earning investment balances and lower interest rates in each year 
interest expense decreased to zero in due to the repayment of our line of credit and bank loan in october the decrease in from was primarily attributed to a reduction in the average balance of our line of credit and a reduction in applicable interest rates 
other income  net change change in thousands other income  net other income  net in includes  from the sale of two pre clinical anti infective programs to micrologix biotech inc  a canadian company  in may  for  in cash and  shares of series a preferred stock of micrologix 
the shares are redeemable at per share or convertible into common stock at the election of micrologix upon the occurrence of certain time and achievement milestones as follows shares converted into common stock with a value of  upon the four month anniversary of the effective date of the agreement  shares will convert into common stock with a value of  upon commencement of certain toxicology studies  and shares will convert into common stock with a value of  upon filing for marketing approval for certain drugs in certain countries

table of contents shares at per share  which was triggered by the first milestone set forth above 
no other income was recorded in either or as a result of this transaction 
income taxes since inception  we have incurred operating losses and accordingly have not recorded a provision for income taxes for any of the periods presented 
as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes of approximately million and million  respectively 
we also had federal and state research and development tax credits each of approximately million 
if not utilized  the net operating losses and credits will expire in the years through utilization of net operating losses and credits may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code of  as amended 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of our net operating losses and credit carryforwards before they can be used 
please read note of the notes to the financial statements included in item of this form k for further information 
liquidity and capital resources change change in thousands cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash and short term investments at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  representing an increase of million from december  short term investments were million in as compared to million in  and restricted cash remained at  we had no debt outstanding as of december  we invest excess funds in short term money market funds and securities pursuant to our investment policy guidelines 
the following is an analysis of changes in our cash and cash equivalents in each respective year 
in thousands net cash used in operating activities net cash provided by used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents the net cash used in operating activities decreased in from  primarily due to a reduction in the net loss from million to million  which primarily resulted from lower clinical trial expenses between the respective years and restructuring actions taken in the decrease from to was primarily due to a reduction in net loss from million to million  which primarily resulted from million of restructuring expenses in  and related reductions in operating cash outflows as a result of lower clinical trial activity and internal operating costs in the net cash used in investing activities in relates to the purchase of million of short term investments  partially offset by the maturity of short term investments of million 
in  the cash used primarily relates to the purchase of million of short term investments  partially offset by the proceeds from the sale of two pre clinical programs to micrologix for  the change from to was primarily due to the maturities of short term investments totaling million in the cash provided by financing activities in primarily related to two private placement transactions 
in may  the company sold shares of a newly created series a convertible preferred stock and issued warrants to purchase  shares of common stock  resulting in net cash proceeds of million  and in october  the company sold  shares of newly issued common stock and issued warrants to purchase  shares of common stock  resulting in net cash proceeds of million 
cash provided by 
table of contents financing activities in was primarily due to net proceeds of approximately million and million from two private placements of common stock  partially offset by million in payments on financing obligations to a bank 
the cash used in financing activities in was primarily due to payments on financing obligations of million  partially offset by proceeds from financing obligations of million 
contractual obligations the impact that our contractual obligations as of december  are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods is as follows  in thousands payments due by period less more than between between than total year years years years drug substance operating leases total contractual commitments drug substance commitments are to the same contract manufacturer to which we prepaid million for an order of seven kilograms of iseganan hcl bulk drug substance 
in  the commitment represents the potential payment of  upon acceptance of this order  when and if this occurs  and  in fees for storage of iseganan hc the remaining  represents storage fees for iseganan hc through operating leases relate to the lease for our facility in palo alto  california  which expires on may   and includes an option to extend until november  under the terms of the lease we have committed to pay  in there were no purchase obligations as of december  that included material penalties for cancellation and were enforceable and legally binding 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements as that term is defined in rule of regulation s k that are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
indemnifications in the ordinary course of business  we enter into contractual arrangements under which we may agree to indemnify the third party to such arrangement from any losses incurred relating to the services they perform on behalf of intrabiotics or for losses arising from certain events as defined within the particular contract  which may include  for example  litigation or claims relating to past performance 
such indemnification obligations may not be subject to maximum loss clauses 
historically  payments made related to these indemnifications have been immaterial 
in addition  we have entered into indemnity agreements with each of our directors and executive officers 
such indemnity agreements contain provisions which are in some respects broader than the specific indemnification provisions contained in delaware law 
we also maintain an insurance policy for our directors and executive officers insuring against certain liabilities arising in their capacities as such 
future capital requirements we expect to continue to incur substantial operating losses and will not receive any product revenues until a product candidate has been approved by the fda and successfully commercialized 
we currently anticipate our cash  cash equivalents and investments to be sufficient to fund operations for at least the next months 
we expect  however  that we will need to raise significant additional funds to continue our operations  
table of contents complete the second pivotal efficacy trial of iseganan hcl for vap if the first trial is successful  and for the fda approval process and commercialization if fda approval is received 
this forecast is a forward looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties  and actual results could vary 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the timing  delay  cost  extent and results of clinical trials  future opportunities for raising capital  payments to third parties for manufacturing scale up  the costs and timing of regulatory approvals  the costs of establishing sales  marketing and distribution capabilities  and the progress of our development activities 
until we can generate sufficient cash from our operations  which we do not expect for the foreseeable future  we expect to finance future cash needs through private and public financings  including equity financings 
we may also generate cash through collaboration or licensing arrangements  although no such transactions are currently under negotiation 
we intend to raise additional capital in in one or more transactions 
we cannot be certain  however  that additional funding will be available when needed or on favorable terms 
if additional funding is not available  we may need to delay or curtail our development and clinical trial activities to a significant extent  or we may be forced to cease operations 
recent accounting pronouncements see note of the financial statements for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements including the respective effects on the company s financial condition  results of operations and disclosure 
factors that could affect future results our future financial condition results of operations and disclosures could be materially affected by the risks and uncertainties discussed below  or otherwise  and historic trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods 
if either of our two pivotal clinical trials of iseganan hcl for the prevention of vap or any future clinical trials of iseganan hcl for other indications are unsuccessful  we may be forced to cease operations 
we currently have only one product candidate  iseganan hcl 
in  we completed two phase iii clinical trials of iseganan hcl for the prevention of ulcerative oral mucositis  a complication that develops in certain cancer patients receiving chemotherapy or radiation therapy that results in painful ulcer like sores in the mouth and throat 
both of these clinical trials failed to meet their primary endpoints and we are no longer pursuing iseganan hcl for the prevention of ulcerative oral mucositis 
we are currently pursuing iseganan hcl for the prevention of vap 
enrollment in the first of two pivotal trials commenced in september  and we expect to announce its results by the end of the failure of either of the two pivotal trials in meeting their primary endpoint  or of any other future clinical trials of iseganan hcl for alternative indications  will negatively impact our future operating results and may force us to cease operations 
if we fail to complete any clinical trial  or fail to obtain fda approval for any product candidate that we develop  acquire or license  we may never achieve profitability and we may have to cease operations 
we do not have a drug approved for sale in the united states or any foreign market and we do not know whether we will be successful in developing iseganan hcl for the prevention of vap or other indications  or in developing  acquiring or licensing any other products and successfully obtaining fda or foreign approvals for them 
we must successfully complete clinical trials and demonstrate manufacturing capability before we can file with the fda for approval to sell any product in the united states or with foreign regulatory authorities in 
table of contents order to sell to other countries 
the fda could require us to repeat or perform amended clinical trials as a result of their regulatory review  and there is no guarantee that foreign regulatory authorities will acknowledge approvals by the fda  and we may be required to perform additional clinical trials before being approved to sell in foreign markets 
delays in obtaining or failure to obtain regulatory approvals may delay or prevent the successful commercialization of our drug candidate  diminish any competitive advantage we may have  and defer or decrease our receipt of revenues or royalties 
the regulatory review and approval process is lengthy  expensive and uncertain 
extensive pre clinical and clinical data and supporting information must be submitted to the fda for each indication to establish safety and effectiveness in order to secure fda approval 
a number of new drugs for certain indications  iseganan hcl for the prevention of oral mucositis included  have shown promising results in early clinical trials  but subsequently failed to establish sufficient safety and efficacy data to obtain necessary regulatory approvals 
a number of companies have also suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials  including issues related to the design or conduct of those trials 
we have had to re perform a phase iii clinical trial in the past  following a drug dispensing error by a contract vendor 
we have limited experience in obtaining drug approvals  and cannot be certain when  if ever  we will receive these regulatory approvals 
if we are unable to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of any drug candidate  we will be unable to obtain the required regulatory approvals and we will be unable to commercialize a drug candidate and generate product revenue 
in addition to initial regulatory approval  any drug will be subject to extensive and rigorous ongoing domestic and foreign government regulation 
any approvals  once obtained  may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or safety problems are identified  and failure to comply with these requirements may subject us to stringent penalties 
we must raise capital to continue our operations  and if we fail to obtain the capital necessary to fund our operations  we will be unable to develop our drug candidates and may have to cease operations 
we expect  that we will need to raise significant additional funds to complete the second pivotal efficacy trial of iseganan hcl for vap if the first trial is successful  and for the fda approval process and commercialization if fda approval is received 
we also believe that additional financing will be required in the future to fund our operations  to conduct any trials of iseganan hc for other indications  to acquire or license any other products  or to commercialize any other product candidates 
we do not know whether additional financing will be available when needed or on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to raise additional financing when necessary  we may have to delay our product development efforts or any product acquisitions or be forced to cease operations our future liquidity and capital requirements will also depend on many other factors  including the timing  cost  and progress of our current vap trial  the cost to obtain regulatory approval for any product in the united states and other countries  and decisions with respect to strategic alternatives 
if we raise additional capital by issuing securities or through collaboration and licensing arrangements  our existing stockholders may experience dilution or we may be required to relinquish rights to our technologies or product candidates 
additional financing may be raised through public or private equity offerings  debt financings or additional collaboration and licensing arrangements 
to the extent that we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities  our stockholders may experience dilution 
to the extent that we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements  it may be necessary to relinquish some rights to our technologies or product candidates  or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us 

table of contents we will be dependent on third party contract manufacturers for the future production of iseganan hcl and for producing information required to register iseganan hcl with the fda if our trials are successful 
if our manufacturing partners fail to manufacture iseganan hcl in accordance with set specifications or fail to produce the necessary information  our operations and related results could be adversely affected 
we have relied on a single contract manufacturer to manufacture the iseganan hcl bulk drug substance for our pivotal clinical trials 
we currently maintain a sufficient inventory of iseganan hcl to complete planned clinical trials 
however  if no alternate sources of supply are developed  we will depend on this manufacturer to produce iseganan hcl and information required for fda registration and to produce iseganan hcl for future commercial use if our pivotal trials are successful 
in we received a lot from this contract manufacturer that we have not yet been satisfied was manufactured in accordance with a validation plan or that related documentation is adequate 
although the product is not expected to be required for our pivotal clinical trials  it is expected to be used to validate the manufacturing process 
if the manufacturer is unable to validate the manufacturing process  or to produce iseganan hcl and the required information for fda registration  or to produce iseganan hcl for future commercial use on a timely basis and in accordance with set specifications  or we experience similar issues to those experienced on this order  we may not have sufficient quantities of iseganan hcl and sufficient information to meet registration requirements or sufficient quantities of iseganan hcl for future commercial use 
we also rely on a single third party supplier to produce iseganan hcl formulated drug product for use in our clinical trials 
if this supplier is unable or fails to produce the required quantities of iseganan hcl formulated drug product for clinical use or commercial sale on a timely basis  at commercially reasonable prices  and with sufficient purity  we will not have sufficient quantities to complete current and future clinical trials  or to meet commercial demand 
if our contract research organizations assisting in our clinical trials fail to appropriately manage our clinical trials  the trials could be delayed or could fail and our results of operations and financial condition would suffer 
we rely on contract research organizations to assist us in managing and monitoring our clinical trial 
we have entered into agreements with amarex  llc  orion clinical services  ltd and advanced clinical trials  inc  among others  to provide clinical research services 
the fda may inspect some of our clinical investigational sites  our contract research organizations records and our facility and files to determine if the clinical trial is conducted according to good clinical practices 
if the fda determines that the trial is not in compliance with good clinical practices  we may be required to repeat the clinical trial 
if our contract research organizations fail to perform under our agreements with them  we may face delays in completing our clinical trial or failure of our clinical program 
development and commercialization of competitive products or new technologies could reduce or prevent sales of any future products that we develop  acquire or license  and our results of operations would suffer 
we may be unable to compete successfully if other companies develop and commercialize competitive products that are less expensive  more effective  have fewer side effects or are easier to administer than drug candidates which we develop  acquire or license 
if we are unable to compete successfully with any future drug candidate  physicians may not recommend and patients may not buy our drug 
we are not aware of any products that compete with iseganan hcl for the prevention of vap 
however  pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies may develop products in the future that compete with iseganan hcl for the prevention of vap 
many of these companies have substantially greater experience  financial resources and larger research and development staffs than we do 
in addition  many of these companies  either alone or together with their collaborative partners  have significantly greater experience than we do in developing drugs  obtaining regulatory approvals and manufacturing and marketing products 
we also compete with these organizations and other companies for in licensing opportunities for future drug candidates  and for attracting scientific and management personnel 

table of contents if we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property  we may be unable to sell our products or to compete effectively 
we rely on a combination of patents  trade secrets and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property 
if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property  other companies or individuals may prevent us from selling our products or may develop competing products based on our technology 
our success depends in part on our ability to obtain patents  protect trade secrets  operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others  and prevent others from infringing on our proprietary rights 
we will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our proprietary rights are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets 
we expect to protect our proprietary position by filing us and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology  inventions and improvements that are important to the development of our business 
for example  we own or have rights to ten patents and four pending patent applications in the united states 
however  the patent position of biopharmaceutical companies involves complex legal and factual questions 
we cannot predict the enforceability or scope of any issued patents or those that may issue in the future 
patents  if issued  may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
consequently  if any patents that we own or license from third parties do not provide sufficient protection  our competitive position would be weakened 
furthermore  others may independently develop similar technologies or duplicate any technology that we have developed 
in addition  we may not be issued patents for our pending patent applications  those we may file in the future or those we may license from third parties 
in addition to patents  we rely on trade secrets and proprietary know how 
our contract manufacturers perform the manufacturing processes covered by these trade secrets 
accordingly  our contract manufacturers and we must maintain confidentiality 
we have confidentiality and proprietary information agreements with our contract manufacturers and with our employees 
these agreements may not provide meaningful protection or adequate remedies for our technology in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of confidential and proprietary information 
we may be subject to intellectual property litigation that could be costly and time consuming and would affect our results of operations and financial condition 
the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries have been characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights 
although we are not currently a party to any lawsuits  third parties may assert infringement or other intellectual property claims against us 
we may have to pay substantial damages  including treble damages for past infringement if it is ultimately determined that our products infringe a third party s proprietary rights 
the defense and prosecution of intellectual property suits  us patent and trademark office interference proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings in the u 
s and internationally are costly and time consuming to pursue and their outcome is uncertain 
if we become involved in any of these proceedings  we will incur substantial expense  and the efforts of our technical and management personnel will be significantly diverted 
an adverse determination may result in the invalidation of our patents  subject us to significant liabilities or require us to seek licenses that may not be available from third parties on satisfactory terms  or at all 
our stock price could decline because of litigation or interference proceedings initiated or threatened against us 

table of contents if physicians and patients do not accept our products  we may be unable to generate significant revenue  if any  and we may be forced to cease operations 
any drug candidate that we develop  acquire or license may not gain market acceptance among physicians  patients and the medical community 
if any drug candidate fails to achieve market acceptance  we may be unable to successfully market and sell the product  which would limit our ability to generate revenue 
the degree of market acceptance of any drug candidate depends on a number of factors  including demonstration of clinical efficacy and safety  cost effectiveness  in particular with iseganan hcl s anticipated application for the prevention of vap  convenience and ease of administration  potential advantage over alternative treatment methods  and marketing and distribution support 
physicians will not recommend our products until such time as clinical data or other factors demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our drugs as compared to other treatments 
in practice  competitors may be more effective in marketing their drugs 
even if the clinical safety and efficacy of our product is established  physicians may elect not to recommend its use 
for example  physicians may be reluctant to prescribe widespread use of our product because of concern about developing bacterial strains that are resistant to our drugs  or because of the cost of our drug 
the failure to recruit and retain key personnel may delay our ability to execute our business plan and our results of operations could suffer 
we are highly dependent on our management and technical staff 
competition for personnel is intense 
if we lose the services of any of our senior management or technical staff  we may be unable to successfully complete our planned clinical trials for vap 
in particular  the loss of the services of henry j 
fuchs  our president and chief executive officer  or steven ketchum  our vice president  regulatory affairs  could significantly impede our research and development efforts  our relations with potential collaborators and completion of our planned clinical trials for vap 
we do not have employment agreements with mr 
fuchs or mr 
ketchum 
we do not maintain key person life insurance and do not have employment agreements with our other members of management and technical staff 
in october  we completed a restructuring that included a reduction in force of approximately of our workforce 
as of december   we had nine full time employees 
in order to pursue any future product development  marketing and commercialization  we will need to hire additional qualified scientific personnel to perform research and development and personnel with expertise in clinical testing  government regulation  manufacturing  marketing and finance 
we may not be able to attract and retain personnel on acceptable terms given the competition for such personnel among biotechnology  pharmaceutical and other companies 
in addition  we rely on consultants to assist us in formulating our research and clinical development strategy 
these consultants may have commitments to  or relationships with  other entities that may limit their availability to us 
the loss of the services of these personnel may delay our research and development efforts 
directors  executive officers  principal stockholders and affiliated entities beneficially own approximately of our capital stock and may be able to exert control over our activities  and our results of operations and financial condition may suffer 
as of december   our directors  executive officers  principal stockholders and affiliated entities beneficially own  in the aggregate  approximately of our outstanding common stock 
these stockholders  if acting together  will be able to control the outcome of any matter requiring approval by our stockholders  including the election of directors and the approval of mergers or other business combination transactions 

table of contents anti takeover provisions in our charter documents and under delaware law may make an acquisition of us more difficult 
provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders 
these provisions provide for a classified board of directors of which approximately one third of the directors will be elected each year  allow the authorized number of directors to be changed only by resolution of the board of directors  require that stockholder actions must be effected at a duly called stockholder meeting and prohibit stockholder action by written consent  establish advance notice requirements for nominations to the board of directors or for proposals that can be acted on at stockholder meetings  and limit who may call stockholder meetings 
in addition  because we are incorporated in delaware  we are governed by the provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law  which may prohibit large stockholders from consummating a merger with  or acquisition of us 
these provisions may prevent a merger or acquisition that would be attractive to stockholders and could limit the price that investors would be willing to pay in the future for our common stock 
the change in our stock price over time may significantly impact our results of operations through certain stock compensation charges that depend upon our closing stock price at the end of each quarter 
market prices for securities of biotechnology companies are general highly volatile and our stock may be subject to such volatility 
our non cash variable stock compensation expense in relation to  stock options that were cancelled and re granted in a one for one exchange and  options that were re granted in connection with the cancellation of  unexercised stock options in february is dependent upon the price of our common stock at each quarter end 
in  we recorded non cash variable stock compensation expense of approximately million in relation to these options 
these expenses will be incurred through the five year term of the options  unless previously forfeited or exercised 
future changes in the company s stock price may therefore have a significant impact on the company s future results of operations as a result of this dependency 
our stock price may be volatile  and the value of your investment may decline 
after accounting for the effect of our for reverse stock split in april  during our closing stock prices ranged from a low of to a high of  and in ranged from a low of to a high of 
the following factors  in addition to the other risk factors described in this section  may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock announcements regarding strategic alternatives  including a merger or sale of the company or acquisition or license of products or product candidates  publicity regarding actual or perceived adverse events in our clinical trial or relating to products under development by us or our competitors  announcements of technological innovations or new commercial products by our competitors or us  developments concerning proprietary rights  regulatory developments in the united states or foreign countries  litigation  significant short selling in our common stock

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve our capital until it is required to fund operations while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
as of december   we own financial instruments that are sensitive to market risk as part of our investment portfolio 
to minimize this risk  in accordance with our investment policy guidelines  we place investments with high credit quality issuers and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
the average duration of our investment portfolio in and was less than one year 
due to the short term nature of these investments  a basis point movement in market interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair value of our portfolio as of december  and we have no investments denominated in foreign country currencies and therefore our investments are not subject to foreign currency exchange risk
