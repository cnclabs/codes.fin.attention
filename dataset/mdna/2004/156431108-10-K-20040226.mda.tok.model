item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company produces primary aluminum 
the aluminum industry is cyclical and the price of primary aluminum which trades as a commodity is determined by global supply and demand 
the key determinants of the company s results of operations and cash flow from operations are as follows the company s selling price is based on the lme price of primary aluminum and fixed price sales contracts 
the company s plants operate near capacity  and fluctuations in volume  other than through acquisitions  generally are small 
the principal components of cost of goods sold are alumina  power  and labor  which were in excess of of the cost of goods sold 
many of these costs are covered by long term contracts as described below 
average realized price and cost of goods sold per pound shipped are key performance indicators 
revenue varies significantly from period to period due to fluctuations in the lme price of aluminum 
any adverse changes in the conditions that affect the market price of primary aluminum could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and cash flows 
revenue is also impacted by the company s hedging activities 
working capital is relatively stable 
fluctuations in working capital are influenced by the lme price of primary aluminum and by the timing of cash receipts and disbursements from major customers and suppliers 
cost of goods sold  excluding alumina  is expected to remain relatively stable because the company s plants operate near capacity and its major cost drivers are covered by long term contracts 
fluctuations in the cost of alumina are expected as the pricing in these contracts is variable  based on lme prices 
power contracts provide for primarily fixed priced power through  subject to adjustments for fuel costs for mt 
holly 
power usage is expected to be consistent with prior periods 
labor costs should be consistent with modest increases for negotiated salary and benefit increases 
the following discussion reflects the company s historical results of operations  which do not include results from the company s interest in the hawesville facility until the interest was acquired in april and do not include the company s interest in hawesville facility until it was acquired in april accordingly  the results for fiscal years and are not fully comparable to the results of operations for fiscal year and are not indicative of the company s current business

key long term supply agreements alumina supply agreements the company is party to long term supply agreements with glencore and kaiser that supply a fixed quantity of alumina at prices indexed to the price of primary aluminum quoted on the lme

table of contents kaiser filed for bankruptcy under chapter of the bankruptcy code in february subsequent to that date  and with bankruptcy court approval  kaiser agreed to assume the company s alumina supply agreement  and it agreed to a new alumina supply agreement for the company s hawesville facility for the years through to date  kaiser has continued to supply alumina to the company pursuant to the terms of its agreement 
in june  kaiser announced it was exploring the sale of several of its facilities  including gramercy 
the company  together with a partner  is considering purchasing that facility 
if the company were to acquire the gramercy facility  the price the company would pay for alumina used by the hawesville facility would be based on the cost of alumina production  rather than the lme price for primary aluminum 
those production costs may be materially higher than an lme based price 
if the company were not to purchase the gramercy facility  and kaiser or a successor failed to continue to supply alumina to the hawesville facility pursuant to the terms of the agreements  the company s costs for alumina could increase substantially  and it may not be able to fully recover damages resulting from breach of those contracts

facility organization term ravenswood uswa through may  hawesville uswa through march  mt 
holly not unionized not applicable application of critical accounting policies the company s significant accounting policies are discussed in note of the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of the financial statements requires that management make subjective estimates  assumptions and judgments in applying these accounting policies 
those judgments are normally based on knowledge and experience about past and current events and on assumptions about future events 
critical accounting estimates require management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate and a change in these estimates may have a material impact on the presentation of the company s financial position or results of operations 
significant judgments and estimates made by the company include expenses and liabilities related to pensions and other postemployment benefits and forward delivery contracts and financial instruments 

table of contents pension and other postemployment benefit liabilities the company sponsors various pension plans and also participates in a union sponsored multi employer pension plan for the collective bargaining unit employees at the hawesville facility 
the liabilities and annual income or expense of the company s pension and other postemployment benefit plans are determined using methodologies that involve several actuarial assumptions  the most significant of which are the discount rate and the long term rate of asset return 
in developing its expected long term rate of return assumption for pension fund assets  the company evaluated input from its actuaries  including their review of asset class return expectations as well as long term inflation assumptions 
projected returns are based on historical returns of broad equity and bond indices 
the company also considered its historical year compound returns 
century anticipates that  as the economy recovers  the company s investments will generate long term rates of return of 
the company s expected long term rate of return is based on an assumed asset allocation of equity funds and fixed income funds 
the discount rate that the company utilizes for determining future pension and post employment obligations is based on a review of long term bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency 
the discount rate determined on this basis has decreased to at december  from and at december  and  respectively 
lowering the expected long term rate of return by from to would have increased the company s pension expense for the year ended december  by approximately million 
lowering the discount rate assumptions by would have increased the company s pension expense for the year ended december  by approximately million 
the company provides postemployment benefit plans that provide health care and life insurance benefits for substantially all retired employees 
sfas no 
requires the company to accrue the estimated cost of providing postretirement benefits during the working careers of those employees who could become eligible for such benefits when they retire 
the company funds these benefits as the retirees submit claims 
measurement of the company s postretirement benefit obligations requires the use of several assumptions about factors that will affect the amount and timing of future benefit payments 
the assumed health care cost trend rates are the most critical assumptions for measurement of the postretirement benefits obligation 
changes in the health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care benefit obligations 
the company assumes medical inflation is initially  declining to over six years and thereafter 
a one percentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects in one percentage one percentage point increase point decrease in thousands effect on total of service and interest cost components effect on accumulated postretirement benefit obligation forward delivery contracts and financial instruments the company routinely enters into fixed and market priced contracts physical and financial for the sale of primary aluminum and the purchase of raw materials in future periods 
the company applies the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  in accounting for these types of contracts 
for those physical delivery contracts which management believes are probable of future delivery  such contracts are classified as normal purchases and normal sales and are not accounted for as derivatives 
the aluminum based financial and physical delivery contracts that are derivatives  as provided for in current accounting standards  are marked to market using the lme spot and forward market for primary aluminum 
because there is no quoted futures market price for the us midwest premium component of the market price for primary aluminum  it is necessary for management to estimate the us midwest premium 
fluctuations in the lme price of primary aluminum have a significant impact on gains and losses included in the company s financial statements from period to period 
unrealized gains and losses are either included in other comprehensive income loss or net gain loss on forward contracts  depending on criteria as provided for in the accounting standards 

table of contents the forward natural gas purchase contracts are marked to market using the nymex spot and forward market for natural gas 
fluctuations in the nymex price of natural gas can have a significant impact on gains and losses included in the company s financial statements from period to period 
the company has designated these forward contracts as cash flow hedges for forecasted natural gas transactions in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
as amended 
the company assesses the effectiveness of these cash flow hedges quarterly 
the effective portion of the gains and losses are recorded in other comprehensive income loss and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings 
the ineffective portion of the gain or loss is reported in earnings immediately 
the principal contracts affected by these standards and the resulting effects on the financial statements are described in the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto
