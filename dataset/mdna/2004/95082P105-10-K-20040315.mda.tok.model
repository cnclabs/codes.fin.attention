item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
company overview during  we saw a continuation of lower product demand from the majority of the end markets we serve  although demand for our products strengthened in the fourth quarter consistent with an improving us economy 
our financial results in reflected the positive impact of our margin improvement and cost containment programs  in the face of weaker product demand 
operating income increased on the strength of an basis point improvement in gross margins 
lower fees associated with our receivables facility and lower debt levels translated into lower financing costs  which contributed to our income before taxes increasing over performance 
in addition  our effective tax rate was  versus last year s rate of 
the combination of all of these factors led to an improvement of per share to per share 
our sales can be categorized as stock  direct ship and special order 
stock orders are filled directly from existing inventory and generally represent approximately of total sales 
approximately of our total sales are direct ship sales 
direct ship sales are typically custom built products  large orders or products that are too bulky to be easily handled and  as a result  are shipped directly to the customer from the supplier 
special orders are for products that are not ordinarily stocked in inventory and are ordered based on a customer s specific request 
special orders represent the remainder of total sales 
gross profit margins on stock and special order sales are approximately higher than those on direct ship sales 
although direct ship gross margins are lower  operating profit margins are often comparable  since the product handling and fulfillment costs associated with direct shipments are much lower 
we have historically financed our working capital needs  capital expenditures  acquisitions and new branch openings through internally generated cash flow and borrowings under our credit facilities and funding through our accounts receivable securitization program 
during the initial phase of an acquisition or new branch opening  we typically incur expenses related to installing or converting information systems  training employees and other initial operating activities 
with some acquisitions  we may incur expenses in connection with the closure of any of our own redundant branches 
historically  the costs associated with opening new branches  and closing branches in connection with certain acquisitions  have not been material 
we have accounted for our acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting 
cash flow we generated million in operating cash flow during included in this amount was a million cash outflow from a reduction in our receivables facility 
this operating cash flow  coupled with proceeds from our borrowings  was used for million in capital expenditures and million in repurchases of our class b common stock  as more fully described below 
equity activity during  we completed two equity transactions for the benefit of our shareholders 
in november  we purchased from an institutional holder  at a discount to market  approximately million shares of our outstanding class b common stock at a purchase price of million  representing about of our outstanding common stock 
in december  we redeemed at a discount to market  the net equity value of employee held stock options originally granted in and  representing options to purchase approximately million shares or approximately of our common stock outstanding 
the cash payment of million was made in january the company recognized a tax benefit of million as a result of this transaction 
financing activity we completed the following transactions in to improve our liquidity and capital resources in february  we finalized a million mortgage financing facility  million of which was outstanding as of december  total borrowings under the mortgage financing are subject to a year amortization schedule with a balloon payment due at the end of the year term 
this mortgage financing facility provides additional liquidity and financial flexibility for us as well as locks in longer term fixed interest rates 
in june  the issuer called our million in interest rate swap agreements relating to indebtedness under our senior subordinated notes and as a result we received a million payment 
in september  we entered into a new million interest rate swap agreement and in december we entered into two additional million interest rate swap agreements with respect to indebtedness under our senior subordinated notes 
in september  we entered into a new million receivables facility agreement with four financial institutions 
the new facility provides for a million purchase commitment with a term of days and a million purchase commitment with a term of three years 
we recorded liabilities of approximately million relating to earnout agreements associated with past acquisitions 
as of year end  we had approximately million in available borrowing capacity under our financing facilities  including million under our receivables facility  with no significant debt maturities until outlook the improvements in operations and capital structure achieved in have positioned us well for growth in management believes that if the overall economic recovery forecasted for occurs  it will translate into improved product demand and moderate sales growth 
focus on margin expansion and cost containment should continue to drive improved operating performance in our operating cash flow will be utilized to fund any required working capital additions  capital expenditures and to the extent available continue our deleveraging efforts  as well as fund earnout payments related to the bruckner acquisition 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to supplier programs  bad debts  inventories  insurance costs  goodwill  income taxes  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional adjustments to reserve items may be required 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we have a systematic procedure using estimates based on historical data and reasonable assumptions of collectibility made at the local branch level and at the consolidated corporate basis to calculate the allowance for doubtful accounts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was million at december  and million at december  the total amount recorded as selling  general and administrative expense related to bad debts was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
excess and obsolete inventory we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
a systematic procedure is used to determine excess and obsolete inventory using historical data and reasonable assumptions for the percentage of excess and obsolete inventory on a consolidated basis 
the valuation allowance for excess and obsolete inventories was million at december  and million at december  direct write offs against the reserve related to inventory disposals during totaled million 
the total expense related to excess and obsolete inventories  included in cost of goods sold  was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
supplier rebates we receive rebates from certain suppliers based on contractual arrangements with them 
since there is a lag between actual purchases and the rebates received from the suppliers we must estimate the approximate amount of rebates available at a specific date 
the asset recorded for the supplier rebate program is within other accounts receivable and was million at december  and million at december  the total amount recorded as a reduction to cost of goods sold was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
goodwill as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  we test goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently when events or circumstances occur indicating goodwill might be impaired 
this process involves estimating fair value using discounted cash flow analyses 
considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate discounted future cash flows 
assumptions used for these estimated cash flows were based on a combination of historical results and current internal forecasts 
two primary assumptions were an average revenue growth rate of and an average discount rate of 
we cannot predict certain events that could adversely affect the reported value of goodwill  which totaled million at december  and million at december  insurance programs we use commercial insurance for auto  workers compensation  casualty and health claims as a risk reduction strategy to minimize catastrophic losses 
our strategy involves large deductibles where we must pay all costs up to the deductible amount 
we estimate our reserve based on historical incident rates and costs 
the assumptions included in developing this accrual include the period of time from incurrence of a medical claim until the claim is paid by the insurance provider 
presently  this period is estimated to be eight weeks 
the total liability related to the insurance programs was million at december  and million at december  taxes we record our deferred tax assets at amounts that are expected to be realized 
we evaluate future taxable income and potential tax planning strategies in assessing the potential need for a valuation allowance 
should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
we review tax issues and positions taken on tax returns and determine the need and amount of contingency reserves necessary to cover any potential audit adjustments 
accounts receivable securitization program we maintain an accounts receivable securitization program the receivables facility  whereby we sell  on a continuous basis  to wesco receivables corporation  a wholly owned  special purpose company spc  an undivided interest in all domestic accounts receivable 
the spc sells without recourse to a third party conduit  all the eligible receivables while maintaining a subordinated interest  in the form of overcollateralization  in a portion of the receivables 
we account for the receivables facility in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
at the time the receivables are sold  the balances are removed from the balance sheet 
the receivables facility represents off balance sheet financing  since the conduit s ownership interest in the accounts receivable of the spc results in the removal of accounts receivable from our consolidated balance sheets  rather than resulting in the addition of a liability to the conduit 
we believe that the terms of the agreements governing this facility qualify our trade receivable sales transactions for sale treatment under generally accepted accounting principles  which requires us to remove the accounts receivable from our consolidated balance sheets 
absent this sale treatment  our consolidated balance sheet would reflect additional accounts receivable and debt 
our consolidated statements of operations would not be impacted  except that other expenses would be classified as interest expense 
results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage relationship to net sales of certain items in our consolidated statements of operations for the periods presented year ended december net sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization income from operations interest expense loss on debt extinguishment other expenses net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income compared to net sales 
net sales for decreased by approximately million  or  compared with the prior year 
the continuing weakness in the north american economy has adversely affected capital spending and industrial project activity in the major industrial and mro markets where we participate 
these results were somewhat offset by increased sales of approximately million to customers served by our integrated supply and national accounts groups 
in addition  sales to international customers improved principally due to the strength of the canadian dollar 
gross profit 
gross profit in increased to million from million as the gross profit percentage improved by basis points to 
the improvement in gross profit was driven primarily by improved product billing margins which increased basis points over a primary reason for the improvement is a company wide focus on pricing  procurement and administration of supplier contracts 
improved performance with supplier volume rebate programs as well as lower inventory adjustments also contributed to the improvement in gross profit 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a 
sg a expenses include costs associated with all personnel  shipping and handling  travel and entertainment  advertising  utilities and bad debts 
sg a expenses increased by million  or  to million 
the current year s total includes million of expenses associated with discretionary retirement related contributions made in which had not been made since fees and expenses associated with certain legal matters increased sg a by million relating to a settlement agreement with regard to an employment and wages claim which was resolved in bad debt expense was million for compared to million for we have seen an increase in low profile  smaller dollar bankruptcies and troubled accounts as companies try to cope with the prolonged economic downturn 
we are monitoring creditworthiness of our customer base closely and believe our credit limits and reserves are appropriate at this time 
shipping and handling expense included in sg a was million in compared with million in depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased million to million in versus million in amortization increased by million due to increased amortization associated with a non compete agreement and increased amortization of capitalized software due to higher expenditures in prior years 
depreciation increased million principally due to a higher level of spending on assets with shorter estimated lives 
income from operations 
income from operations increased million to million in  compared with million in the increase in operating income is principally attributable to the increase in gross profit partially offset by the increase in sg a expenses and depreciation and amortization 
interest and other expenses 
interest expense totaled million for  a decrease of million from the decline was primarily due to a lower average amount of indebtedness outstanding during the current period as compared to as we continued to improve our liquidity by reducing debt 
loss on debt extinguishments related to our recording net charges of million and million during and  respectively  related to the write off of deferred financing costs associated with our revolving credit facilities 
the loss was partially offset by a million gain on the repurchase of million in outstanding principal amounts of our senior subordinated notes during other expenses totaled million and million in and  respectively  reflecting costs associated with the accounts receivable securitization program 
income taxes 
income tax expense totaled million in  an increase of million from the effective tax rates for and were and  respectively 
the tax provision included a benefit of million as a result of the favorable conclusion of an irs examination 
the tax provision included a million benefit for favorable conclusion to other irs examinations 
in addition  the effective rate was lower than the statutory rate due to deferred taxes being remeasured during the period reflecting the cumulative impact of a change in the expected tax rate that will be applicable when the deferred tax items reverse 
the change in estimate was primarily due to state tax reduction initiatives 
additionally  foreign tax credits contributed to the reduction in the effective rate during both and net income 
net income and diluted earnings per share totaled million and per share  respectively  in  compared with million and per share  respectively  in compared to net sales 
net sales for decreased by approximately million  or  to billion compared with billion in the prior year 
the continuing weakness in the north american economy has adversely affected the major industrial and mro markets where we participate 
gross profit 
gross profit in decreased by million  or  to million from million in the prior year due principally to the decline in net sales 
gross profit margin was in compared with in billing margin improvements of basis points over and a lower level of provision for slow moving and obsolete inventory  were partially offset by lower levels of supplier rebates and cash discounts that resulted from lower purchasing activity and working capital improvements 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a 
sg a expenses decreased by million  or  to million 
the decrease was primarily due to compensation and benefit program expense reductions in the current period 
employee headcount was reduced by since december shipping and handling expense included in sg a was million in compared with million in bad debt expense was million for compared to million for the improvement in resulted primarily from reducing exposure to troubled accounts and industries through more stringent credit policies 
sg a expense expressed as a percentage of sales was for compared with in the increase in sg a expense as a percentage of sales resulted from lower net sales in depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization decreased million to million in reflecting our adoption of sfas no 
we recorded goodwill amortization expense of million in income from operations 
income from operations decreased million to million in  compared with million in the decrease in operating income was principally attributable to lower gross profit caused by the decline in sales  partially offset by the decrease in sg a expenses and discontinuing amortization of goodwill 
interest and other expenses 
interest expense totaled million for  a decrease of million from the decrease in interest expense resulted primarily from a lower level of average debt as well as lower net interest rates including the full year impact in of our interest rate swap agreement 
loss on debt extinguishment of million represented non cash charges recognized upon the replacement of our previous revolving credit agreement 
other expenses totaled million and million in and  respectively  reflecting costs associated with the receivables facility 
the million decrease was principally due to a decrease in the program s advance rates and a lower average level of securitized accounts receivable 
income taxes 
income tax expense totaled million in  a decrease of million from the effective tax rates for and were and  respectively 
the decrease in the rate in was principally related to the reversal of income tax contingency accruals of million upon acceptance by the irs of tax returns filed through and the expected favorable conclusion of the irs examination for  as well as a first quarter income tax benefit of approximately million related to the re measurement of deferred taxes related to the cumulative impact of a change in the expected tax rate that will be applicable when these items reverse 
the decrease in the effective rate was lower as a result of the creation of a foreign finance company and decreased amortization expense from the adoption of sfas no 
liquidity and capital resources total assets were approximately billion at december   a million increase from december  principally attributable to an increase in goodwill of million for amounts earned under acquisition earnout agreements and an increase in accounts receivable attributable to reduced utilization of our receivables facility 
stockholders equity totaled million at december   compared with million at december the following table sets forth our outstanding indebtedness december in millions mortgage facility revolving credit facility senior subordinated notes other less current portion the following table sets forth details of our receivables facility december in millions securitized accounts receivable subordinated retained interest net accounts receivable removed from balance sheet our liquidity needs arise from seasonal working capital requirements  capital expenditures  acquisitions and debt service obligations 
in addition  certain of our acquisition agreements contain earnout provisions based principally on future earnings targets 
the most significant of these agreements relates to the acquisition of bruckner supply company  the terms of which provide for additional contingent consideration to be paid based on achieving earnings targets of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization of bruckner during and under the bruckner acquisition agreement the maximum remaining earnout available was million 
the amount of earnout proceeds earned that is payable in any single year subsequent to achieving the earnings target is capped under this agreement at million per year 
as of december   we accrued an million liability million classified as current and million classified as non current for the estimated amount owed based on performance for contingent consideration relating to the bruckner agreement 
based on performance and the accrual of million no further earnout is available 
certain other acquisitions also contain contingent consideration provisions  only one of which could require a significant payment 
management estimates this payment could be up to million and would be made in to meet our funding requirements  we use a mix of internally generated cash flow  our revolving credit facility  our receivables facility and equity transactions 
in  we anticipate capital expenditures to increase by approximately million from capital expenditures of approximately million 
as of february   we have no specific near term plans to make an acquisition 
the required annual principal repayments for the next five years and thereafter  as of december  in thousands thereafter  mortgage financing facility in february  we finalized a mortgage financing facility of million 
total borrowings under the mortgage financing are subject to a year amortization schedule with a balloon payment due at the end of the year term 
proceeds from the borrowings were used primarily to reduce outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
revolving credit facility in march  wesco distribution  inc entered into a million revolving credit agreement that is collateralized by substantially all inventory owned by wesco and also by the accounts receivable of wesco canada 
during  we executed an amendment reducing the size of this revolving credit facility to million 
we recorded a million non cash charge associated with the write off of deferred financing fees related to this reduction 
availability under the facility  which matures in  is limited to the amount of us and canadian eligible inventory and canadian receivables applied against certain advance rates 
borrowings under the facility were used to retire a previous revolving credit facility 
interest on this facility is at libor plus a margin that ranges between to depending upon the amount of excess availability under the facility 
as long as the average daily excess availability for both the preceding and projected succeeding day period is greater than million  then we would be permitted to make acquisitions and repurchase outstanding public stock and bonds 
the above permitted transactions would also be allowed if such excess availability is between million and million and our fixed charge coverage ratio  as defined by the agreement  is at least to after taking into consideration the permitted transaction 
additionally  if excess availability under the agreement is less than million  then we must maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of to we were in compliance with all such covenants as of december  at december   there were no borrowings outstanding under the facility 
at december   we had approximately million available for borrowing under our facility compared to approximately million available at december  senior notes at december   we have million in aggregate outstanding principal amount of senior subordinated notes due the notes were issued with an average issue price of 
during  we repurchased million in aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes at a net gain of million 
interest rate swap agreements in september and october  we entered into four separate fixed to floating interest rate swap agreements  each with a notional amount of million 
in june  these agreements were called by the issuer and as a result we received a million payment 
the gain resulting from the settlement of these agreements has been deferred and is being amortized as a reduction of interest expense over the remaining term of the senior subordinated notes 
in september  we entered into a new million interest rate swap agreement and in december  we entered into two additional million interest rate swap agreements 
these agreements have terms expiring concurrently with the maturity of our senior subordinated notes and were entered into with the intent of converting million of the senior subordinated notes from a fixed to floating rate 
pursuant to these agreements  we receive semi annual fixed interest payments at the rate of commencing december  and make semi annual variable interest rate payments at six month libor rates plus a premium in arrears 
the libor rates in the agreements reset every six months and at december   the rates ranged from to 
in  for the months they were in existence  the agreements had the effect of reducing the interest cost on million of the senior notes from to 
the agreements can be terminated by the counterparty in accordance with a redemption schedule that is consistent with the redemption schedule for the senior subordinated notes 
we enter into interest rate swap agreements as a means to hedge our interest rate exposure and maintain certain amounts of variable rate and fixed rate debt 
since the swaps have been designated as hedging instruments  their fair values are reflected in our consolidated balance sheets 
net amounts to be received or paid under the swap agreements are reflected as adjustments to interest expense 
off balance sheet arrangements accounts receivable securitization program in september  we entered into a new million receivables facility agreement with four financial institutions 
the new facility provides for a million purchase commitment with a term of days and a million purchase commitment with a term of three years 
presently  we expect the million portion of the facility to be renewed in september under the receivables facility  wesco sells  on a continuous basis  to wesco receivables corporation  a wholly owned spc  an undivided interest in all domestic accounts receivable 
the spc sells without recourse to a third party conduit  all the eligible receivables while maintaining a subordinated interest  in the form of overcollateralization  in a portion of the receivables 
wesco has agreed to continue servicing the sold receivables for the financial institution at market rates  accordingly  no servicing asset or liability has been recorded 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
as of december  and  securitized accounts receivable totaled approximately million and million  respectively  of which the subordinated retained interest was approximately million and million  respectively 
accordingly  approximately million and million of accounts receivable balances were removed from the consolidated balance sheets at december  and  respectively 
wesco reduced its receivables facility by million in and by million in costs associated with the receivables facility totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
these amounts are recorded as other expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and are primarily related to the discount and loss on the sale of accounts receivables  partially offset by related servicing revenue 
cash flow an analysis of cash flows for and follows operating activities 
cash provided by operating activities totaled million for the year ended december   compared to million a year ago 
cash provided by operations in and included net outflows of million and million  respectively  associated with changes related to our receivables facility 
in  cash generated by net income of million plus adjustments for non cash items totaling million along with cash inflows for reductions in inventory of million and increases in accounts payable and other liabilities of million were partially offset by the previously mentioned million reduction in our receivables facility 
in  cash generated by net income of million plus adjustments for non cash items totaling million along with cash inflows for reductions in accounts receivable of million and reductions in inventory of million were partially offset by decreases in accounts payable and the previously mentioned million reduction in our receivables facility 
investing activities 
net cash used by investing activities was million in  compared to million in cash used for investing activities was higher in due to million more in acquisition payments and million more in capital expenditures 
capital expenditures in were million and were for computer equipment and software and branch and distribution center facility improvements 
in  we expect to pay million pursuant to an earnout agreement associated with the bruckner acquisition 
financing activities 
cash used by financing activities in was million primarily due to a million payment relating to the repurchase of our class b common stock from an institutional holder 
additionally  million of outflows related to the repurchase of senior notes and a net million was used to pay down the revolving credit facility 
offsetting these payments were net proceeds from debt attributable to borrowing million from the mortgage financing facility 
cash used by financing activities was million in that was primarily due to net debt repayments of million 
contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments the following summarizes our contractual obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
in millions to to after total contractual cash obligations mortgage facility revolving credit facility senior subordinated notes acquisition earnout agreements non cancelable operating leases other long term obligations total contractual cash obligations in millions to to after total other commercial commitments standby letters of credit purchase orders for inventory requirements and service contracts are not included in the table above 
generally  our purchase orders and contracts contain clauses allowing for cancellation 
we do not have significant agreements to purchase material or goods that would specify minimum order quantities 
management believes that cash generated from operations  together with amounts available under the credit facility and the receivables facility  will be sufficient to meet our working capital  capital expenditures and other cash requirements for the foreseeable future 
there can be no assurance  however  that this will be or will continue to be the case 
inflation the rate of inflation  as measured by changes in the consumer price index  did not have a material effect on our sales or operating results during the periods presented 
however  inflation in the future could affect our operating costs 
price changes from suppliers have historically been consistent with inflation and have not had a material impact on the results of operations 
seasonality our operating results are affected by certain seasonal factors 
sales are typically at their lowest during the first quarter due to a reduced level of activity during the winter months 
sales increase during the warmer months beginning in march and continuing through november 
sales drop again slightly in december as the weather cools and also as a result of a reduced level of activity during the holiday season 
as a result  we report sales and earnings in the first quarter that are generally lower than that of the remaining quarters 
impact of recently issued accounting standards in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
this interpretation requires unconsolidated variable interest entities to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries if the entities do not effectively disperse the risk and rewards of ownership among their owners and other parties involved 
this interpretation  as amended  is effective for all entities subject to this interpretation no later than the end of the first period that ends after march  we are currently evaluating the impact of this interpretation on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s 
foreign currency risks approximately of our sales are denominated in u 
s 
dollars and are primarily from customers in the u 
s 
as a result  currency fluctuations are currently not material to our operating results 
we do have foreign subsidiaries located in north america  europe and asia and may establish additional foreign subsidiaries in the future 
accordingly  we may derive a more significant portion of our sales from international operations and a portion of these sales may be denominated in foreign currencies 
as a result  our future operating results could become subject to fluctuations in the exchange rates of those currencies in relation to the us dollar 
furthermore  to the extent that we engage in international sales denominated in us dollars  an increase in the value of the u 
s 
dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products less competitive in international markets 
we have and will continue to monitor our exposure to currency fluctuations 
interest rate risks our outstanding indebtedness as of december  is comprised of million of fixed rate borrowings 
in september and october  we entered into four fixed to floating interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of million 
in june  these agreements were called by the issuer and we received a payment of million 
in september  we entered into a new million interest rate swap agreement and in december  we entered into two additional million interest rate swap agreements 
at december   the net fair value of outstanding interest rate derivatives designated as fair value hedges was million 
these interest rate swap agreements combined to reduce interest expense by approximately million in our weighted average interest rate was on the notional amount of million as of december  the agreements can be terminated under certain conditions 
there is no assurance we could find comparable interest rate swap agreements to continue to reduce interest expense at current levels 
as a result of million in fixed to floating interest rate swaps  a hypothetical change in interest rates based on these variable rate borrowing levels would result in a million increase or decrease in annual interest expense
