item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements provided under part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
critical accounting policies and estimates general the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including  but not limited to  those related to revenue and cost recognition including estimated medical claims  loss contracts  professional and general liability self insurance retention  other self funded insurance reserves  legal contingencies  impairment of intangible assets and goodwill  and income taxes 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies are affected by its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue and cost recognition the company s contracts with correctional institutions are principally fixed price contracts adjusted for census fluctuations 
such contracts typically have a term of one to three years with subsequent renewal options and generally may be terminated by the correctional institution at will and without cause upon proper notice 
the contracts typically contain certain risk sharing arrangements  such as stop loss provisions and aggregate limits for off site or pharmaceutical costs 
revenues earned under contracts with correctional institutions are recognized in the period that services are rendered 
cash received in advance for future services is recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as income when the service is performed 
revenues are calculated based on the specific contract terms and fall into one of three general categories fixed fee  population based  or cost plus a margin 
for fixed fee contracts  revenues are recorded based on fixed monthly amounts established in the service contract 
revenue for population based contracts is calculated either as a fixed fee adjusted using a per diem rate for variances in the inmate population from predetermined population levels or by a per diem rate times the average inmate population for the period of service 
for cost plus contracts  revenues are calculated based on actual expenses incurred during the service period plus a contractual margin 
for contracts which include provisions limiting the company s exposure to off site medical services utilization or pharmacy utilization  the company recognizes the additional revenue that would be due from clients based on contract to date utilization compared to the corresponding pro rata contractual limit for such costs 
under all contracts  the company records revenues net of any estimated contractual allowances for potential adjustments resulting from performance or staffing related criteria 
if necessary  the company revises its estimates for such adjustments in future periods when the actual amount of the adjustment is determined 
revenues for the distribution of pharmaceutical and medical supplies are recognized upon delivery of the related products 
healthcare expenses include the compensation of physicians  nurses and other healthcare professionals including any related benefits and all other direct costs of providing the managed care including the costs of professional and general liability insurance and other self funded insurance reserves discussed more fully below 
the cost of healthcare services provided or contracted for are recognized in the period in which they are provided based in part on estimates  including an accrual for estimated unbilled medical services rendered through the balance sheet date 
the company estimates the accrual for unbilled medical services using a claims payment lag methodology based upon historical payment patterns using actual utilization data including hospitalization  one day 
table of contents surgeries  physician visits and emergency room and ambulance visits and their corresponding costs 
for contracts which have sufficient claims payment history  an actuarial analysis is also prepared monthly by an independent actuary to evaluate the adequacy of the accrual 
the analysis takes into account historical claims experience including the average historical costs and billing lag time for such services and other actuarial data 
actual payments and future reserve requirements will differ from the company s current estimates 
the differences could be material if significant adverse fluctuations occur in the healthcare cost structure or the company s future claims experience 
changes in estimates of claims resulting from such fluctuations and differences between actuarial estimates and actual claims payments are recognized in the period in which the estimates are changed or the payments are made 
loss contracts the company accrues losses under its fixed price contracts when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
the company performs this loss accrual analysis on a specific contract basis taking into consideration such factors as future contractual revenue  projected future healthcare and maintenance costs  projected future stop loss insurance recoveries and each contract s specific terms related to future revenue increases as compared to increased healthcare costs 
the projected future healthcare and maintenance costs are estimated based on historical trends and management s estimate of future cost increases 
these estimates are subject to the same adverse fluctuations and future claims experience as previously noted 
on a quarterly basis  the company performs a review of its portfolio of contracts for the purpose of identifying loss contracts and developing a contract loss reserve for succeeding periods 
as a result of its fourth quarter review  the company identified five non cancelable contracts that  based upon management s projections  were expected to continue to incur negative gross margins over their remaining terms 
in december  the company recorded a charge of million to establish a reserve for future losses under these non cancelable contracts 
the five contracts covered by the charge had expiration dates ranging from june  through june  ninety percent of the charge related to the state of kansas department of corrections the kansas doc contract  which was to expire on june   and the city of philadelphia contract  which was renewable annually  at the client s option  through june  in june  the company and the city of philadelphia reached a mutual agreement that the contract between phs and the city of philadelphia would expire effective june  as a result of the earlier than anticipated expiration of this loss contract  the company recorded a gain of million  in the second quarter of  to reduce its reserve for loss contracts 
from july  to september   the company provided services to the city of philadelphia under a transition arrangement 
subsequent to september   the company is continuing to provide healthcare services to the city of philadelphia under modified contract terms 
during the quarter ended june   the company utilized its loss contract reserve at a rate greater than previously anticipated due to an unexpected increase in healthcare expenses associated with the company s contract to provide services to the kansas doc 
the primary causes for the increase in healthcare expenses in this contract were hospitalization and outpatient costs 
the company increased its reserve for loss contracts by million  as of june   to cover estimated future losses under the kansas doc contract  which was to expire in june during the second and third quarters of  the company participated in active discussions with the kansas doc related to a proposal from the company that would significantly reduce the remaining length of the current contract 
in response to the proposal  the kansas doc solicited and received proposals from several other vendors to provide healthcare services to the kansas doc 
after the kansas doc s evaluation of the proposals from the other vendors  in august  the company began discussions with health cost solutions  inc hcs and the kansas doc related to a proposal pursuant to which hcs would assume the company s performance obligation under the kansas doc contract 
on august   the company entered into an assignment and novation agreement with the kansas doc to assign the kansas doc contract to hcs effective october  the company also entered into a general assignment  novation and assumption agreement with hcs to transfer the kansas doc contract to hcs  effective october  beginning october   hcs became solely responsible for the performance of the kansas doc contract  and the company has no obligation to the kansas doc or to hcs related to hcs performance of the contract 
under the terms of the company s agreement with hcs  the company agreed to pay hcs net consideration of million in monthly installments  commencing october  and continuing through june  the net consideration of million is comprised of payments of million to assume the company s obligations under the kansas doc contract  less million related to fixed assets and inventory purchased from the company by hcs 
as a result of the financial terms of the company s agreement with hcs  in the third quarter of  the company reclassified million of its reserve for loss contracts to accounts payable and recorded a gain of million  to reduce its reserve for loss contracts 
this reduction in the reserve  as well as the second quarter increase in the reserve of million  are reflected as 
table of contents components of income loss from discontinued operations  net of tax  in the company s statements of operations 
at december   the company s payable to hcs totals million  with million classified as accounts payable and million classified as a non current liability on the company s consolidated balance sheets 
as of december   the company had a loss contract reserve totaling million  which relates to a county contract that expires on june  negative gross margin and overhead costs charged against the loss contract reserve related to loss contracts  including contracts classified as discontinued operations  totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the amounts charged against the loss contract reserve during represented losses associated with all five of the contracts that were identified during the amounts charged against the loss contract reserve during relate only to the kansas doc contract discussed above and the remaining loss contract  a county contract  which expires on june  in the course of performing its quarterly review in future periods  the company might identify additional contracts which have become loss contracts due to a change in circumstances 
circumstances that might change and result in the identification of a contract as a loss contract in a future period include unanticipated adverse changes in the healthcare cost structure or the utilization of outside medical services in a contract where such changes are not offset by increased revenue 
should a contract be identified as a loss contract in a future period  the company would record  in the period in which such identification is made  a reserve for the estimated future losses that would be incurred under the contract 
such a reserve could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations in the period in which it is recorded 
professional and general liability self insurance retention as a healthcare provider  the company is subject to medical malpractice claims and lawsuits 
the most significant source of potential liability in this regard is the risk of suits brought by inmates alleging lack of timely or adequate healthcare services 
the company may also be liable  as employer  for the negligence of healthcare professionals it employs or the healthcare professionals it engages as independent contractors 
the company s contracts generally require it to indemnify the governmental agency for losses incurred related to healthcare provided by the company or its agents 
to mitigate a portion of this risk  the company maintains its primary professional liability insurance program  principally on a claims made basis 
however  the company assumes significant self insurance risks resulting from the use of large deductibles in and and the use of adjustable premium policies in and for and  the company is covered by separate policies each of which contains a month retro premium with adjustment based on actual losses after months 
the company s ultimate premium for its policy and its policy will depend on the final incurred losses related to each of these separate policy periods 
reserves for estimated losses related to known claims are provided for on an undiscounted basis using internal and external evaluations of the merits of the individual claims  analysis of claim history and the estimated reserves assigned by the company s third party administrator 
any adjustments resulting from the review are reflected in current earnings 
in addition to its reserves for known claims  the company maintains a reserve for incurred but not reported claims 
the reserve for incurred but not reported claims is recorded on an undiscounted basis 
the company s estimates of this reserve are supported by an independent actuarial analysis  which is obtained on a quarterly basis 
at december   the company s reserves for known and incurred but not reported claims totaled million 
reserves for medical malpractice liability fluctuate because the number of claims and the severity of the underlying incidents change from one period to the next 
furthermore  payments with respect to previously estimated liabilities frequently differ from the estimated liability 
changes in estimates of losses resulting from such fluctuations and differences between actuarial estimates and actual loss payments are recognized by an adjustment to the reserve for medical malpractice liability in the period in which the estimates are changed or payments are made 
the reserves can also be affected by changes in the financial health of the third party insurance carriers used by the company 
changes in reserve requirements resulting from a change in the financial health of a third party insurance carrier are recognized in the period in which such factor becomes known 
other self funded insurance reserves at december   the company has approximately million in accrued liabilities for employee health and workers compensation claims 
the company is significantly self insured for employee health and workers compensation claims 
as such  its insurance expense is largely dependent on claims experience and the ability to control claims 
the company accrues the estimated liability for employee health insurance based on its history of claims experience and the time lag between the incident date and the date of actual claim payment 
the company accrues the estimated liability for workers compensation claims based on internal and external evaluations of the merits of the individual claims  analysis of claim history and the estimated reserves assigned by the company s third party administrator 
these estimates could change in the future 

table of contents legal contingencies in addition to professional and general liability claims  the company is also subject to other legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business 
such proceedings generally relate to labor  employment or contract matters 
when estimable  the company accrues an estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of these claims 
such estimates are developed in consultation with outside counsel handling the company s defense in these matters and is based upon an estimated range of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
other than the potential impact of the two florida matters discussed above in item legal proceedings  the company does not believe these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position 
however  it is possible that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in assumptions  new developments or changes in approach  such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with such litigation 
intangible assets and goodwill the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  sfas on january   at which time it ceased amortization of goodwill 
in accordance with sfas  goodwill acquired is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the company performed its annual review as of december  based on the results of this annual review  management has determined that goodwill is not impaired as of december  future events could cause the company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill is impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the company s other identifiable intangible assets  such as customer contracts acquired in acquisitions and covenants not to compete  are amortized on the straight line method over their estimated useful lives 
the company also assesses the impairment of its other identifiable intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
important factors taken into consideration when evaluating the need for an impairment review include the following significant underperformance or loss of key contracts relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the company s assets or in the company s overall business strategy  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
if the company determines that the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment or as a result of its annual impairment review  any impairment is measured using a fair value based goodwill impairment test as required under the provisions of sfas fair value is the amount at which the asset could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties and may be estimated using a number of techniques  including quoted market prices or valuations by third parties  present value techniques based on estimates of cash flows  or multiples of earnings or revenues 
the fair value of the asset could be different using different estimates and assumptions in these valuation techniques 
when the company determines that the carrying value of other intangible assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  any impairment is measured using an estimate of the asset s fair value based on the projected net cash flows expected to result from that asset  including eventual disposition 
future events could cause the company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill associated with its acquired businesses is impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial position and results of operations 
the company evaluates the estimated remaining useful life of its contract intangibles on at least a quarterly basis  taking into account new facts and circumstances  including its retention rate for acquired contracts 
if such facts and circumstances indicate the current estimated life is no longer reasonable  the company adjusts the estimated useful life on a prospective basis 
in the third quarter of  the company revised the estimated life of the contract intangibles  acquired in its acquisition of emsa  from years to years 
the revised life impacted contract intangibles with a gross value of million and  beginning october   resulted in an increase to annual amortization expense of income taxes the company accounts for income taxes under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under the asset and liability method of sfas no 
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future 
table of contents tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
the company regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability taking into consideration such factors as historical losses  projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
sfas no 
requires the company to record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
it further states forming a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed is difficult when there is negative evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years 
at december  and december   a valuation allowance has been recorded equal to the deferred tax assets after considering deferred tax assets that can be realized through offsets to existing taxable temporary differences 
the company s assessment of the valuation allowance could change in the future based upon its levels of pre tax income 
removal of the valuation allowance in whole or in part would result in a non cash reduction in income tax expense during the period of removal 
in addition  because a portion of the valuation allowance as of december  was established to reserve certain deferred tax assets resulting from the exercise of employee stock options  in accordance with sfas  removal of the valuation allowance related to these assets would result in a credit to additional paid in capital 
if the valuation allowance of million as of december  were to be removed in its entirety  the credit to paid in capital would amount to approximately million 
to the extent no valuation allowance is established for the company s deferred tax assets in future periods  future financial statements would reflect a provision for income taxes at the applicable federal and state tax rates on income before taxes
