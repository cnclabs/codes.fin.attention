item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is to inform you about our financial position  liquidity and capital resources as of december  and  and the results of operations for the years ended december   and overview in  we saw an improvement in our overall financial condition due to an increase in our cash flow provided from operations which was a result of a favorable commodity price environment during  a successful exploration  exploitation and development capital program resulting in a net increase in our proved reserves  and an increase in our exit daily production rate from mcfe at december   to mcfe at december  conversely  our total production volume decreased approximately from and our general administrative expenses increased from by approximately 
we continue to be optimistic about the long term outlook for natural gas and crude oil but realize that the overall environment for commodity pricing is very volatile and can be materially affected  favorably or unfavorably  by such factors as imports exports  weather trends  power generation and industrial demands 
the discussion in this section regarding and subsequent periods are all subject to the effects of consummating the proposed transaction which is discussed in item business and item properties general petrohawk transaction 
liquidity and capital resources a company s liquidity is the amount of time expected to elapse until an asset can be converted to cash or conversely until a liability has to be paid 
liquidity is one indication of a company s ability to meet its obligations or commitments 
historically  our major sources of liquidity have come from internally generated cash flow from operations  funds generated from the exercise of warrants options and proceeds from public and private stock offerings 
the following table represents the sources and uses of cash for the years indicated 
for the years ended december  beginning cash balance sources of cash cash provided by operations cash provided by financing activities cash provided by sales of oil gas properties and equipment total sources of cash including cash on hand uses of cash oil and gas expenditures  net of prepaid drilling advances other equipment cash used by financing activities total uses of cash ending cash balance our working capital was a surplus of  at december   compared to a deficit of  at december  the significant increase in our working capital and liquidity for the twelve months ended december   was due to an increase in cash flow from operations resulting from a higher natural gas and crude oil price environment  lower operating expense partially offset by an increase in general and administrative expense and lower oil and gas capital expenditures 
additionally  at december   we had no futures derivative liability associated with our future production volume compared to a futures derivative liability at december   of  which represented the potential unrealized reduction in our future oil and gas revenue based on the current outstanding derivative contracts at that time 
our principal source of short term liquidity is from internally generated cash flow 
should natural gas and crude oil prices decrease materially  our current operating cash flow would decrease and our liquidity and working capital position would be negatively impacted and could adversely impact our growth capability 
our borrowing base capacity under the current credit facility is presently not a material source of capital 
historically  we have not used credit facilities for a source of funds in our drilling or leasing activity 
should proved developed reserves not materially increase and or if pricing materially declines  our borrowing base could be reduced below the amount currently borrowed and outstanding under the facility 
if this event were to occur we would be obligated to pay down the outstanding amount to the re determined borrowing capacity 
we would rely on cash flow from operations and funds generated from the sale of unevaluated and or proved undeveloped properties to make this pay down 
it is possible that we would have to sell some non core assets as well in order to meet this obligation 
the current credit agreement  which was re determined and extended during the quarter ended june   has a maturity date of april  and a current borrowing capacity of  subject to an automatic monthly reduction of  which commenced on july  at december   a balance of  was outstanding against the borrowing base and the effective interest rate  which is a libor base rate plus  was 
during  we reduced our outstanding debt balance by  which was lower than projected 
due to unplanned expenditures associated with the pending petrohawk transaction as discussed further below  additional voluntary paydowns to the outstanding debt were deferred 
for the twelve months ended december   we expended approximately million including changes in prepaid drilling advances primarily comprised of million related to our south central kansas drilling program approximately 
million was expended on acreage and seismic and approximately 
million has been incurred for drilling activity through december  in july  we committed to a well drilling program located within a six county area in the mississippian subcrop belt of south central kansas  which covers approximately  gross acres 
we have a working interest in the program 
all of the prospects are at depths of approximately  feet with of the prospects classified as infill development wells and the remaining two prospects classified as new field exploratory wells 
drilling commenced during the rd quarter of and to date  gross net wells have been drilled  with seven gross net wells deemed successful  four gross net wells were dry holes and two gross 
net wells drilling or in the completion stage 
currently  five gross net wells are producing a total of approximately gross net mcfe of natural gas per day 
four gross net wells are awaiting pipeline connection 

million expended on recompletion and drilling activity at wehlu  oklahoma county  ok 
to date seven gross net wells have been recompleted or stimulated and we have participated in the drilling of one gross 
net well that was completed subsequent to the fourth quarter of the new well is currently producing approximately gross net barrels per day and gross net mcf per day 
we estimate that our daily production has increased by approximately gross net barrels and gross net mcf from our recompletion and remediation activity 

million expended for drilling  completion  workovers and conversion to salt water disposal in the brookshire dome area  waller county  tx 
in  we participated in the drilling of gross net wells  of which eight gross 
net wells were successful  two gross 
net well were dry holes 
our current daily production rate from this activity is approximately gross net mcf of natural gas and gross net bbl of oil 

million expended on the drilling and completion of the ma failla no 
 broussard field  lafayette parish  la  which was tested in the first quarter of and commenced sales on september  we have a working interest in the well  increasing to approximately working interest after well payout 
the well is currently producing approximately  gross net mcf of natural gas and gross net bbl of condensate per day 

million expended on drilling and recompletion activity in mcintosh county and tulsa county  ok 
during the twelve months ended december   we participated in the drilling of four gross net wells in mcintosh county  ok of which two gross 
net wells were successful  one gross 
net well was a dry hole and one gross 
net well is awaiting completion 
currently  the two successful wells are producing gross net mcf of natural gas per day 

million expended on the drilling and completion of two prospects located in the lapeyrouse field  terrebonne parish  louisiana 
we participated with a working interest in the am dupont  which was a successful development well and is currently producing approximately  gross net mcf of natural gas and gross net bbl of condensate per day 
subsequent to december   the jc dupont was successfully completed in which we have a working interest 
the well is currently producing approximately  gross net mcf of natural gas per day 

million expended on other projects with minority interest in south texas 
those projects included a participation with a working interest in an exploratory well located in wharton county  tx which was a dry hole and a recompletion attempt in the rubel located in galveston county  tx which was also unsuccessful 
on december   we entered into a securities purchase agreement with petrohawk pursuant to which petrohawk has agreed to a cash investment of  in our common stock  warrants and a convertible note 
subject to approval by our shareholders  we will receive  for the issuance of  shares of our common stock and five year common stock purchase warrants exercisable at a price of per share 
additionally  we will issue a  convertible note that will be an unsecured five year obligation and after two years will be convertible by the holder into our common stock at a conversion price of per share 
interest only will be payable under the note in quarterly installments at the rate of per annum 
the full amount of the principal and accrued and unpaid interest will be payable on the fifth anniversary of the date of the note 
future use of these proceeds would include paying off the existing outstanding debt  acquisitions of oil and gas properties  future development and exploitation of existing and acquired oil and gas properties and exploration activity 
long term liquidity and capital resources we have no material long term commitments associated with our capital expenditure plans or operating agreements 
consequently  we have a significant degree of flexibility to adjust the level of such expenditures as circumstances warrant 
the level of capital expenditures will vary in future periods depending on the success we have with our exploratory drilling activities in future periods  gas and oil price conditions and other related economic factors
