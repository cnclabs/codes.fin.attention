item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction our existing business consists of investments in our core assets  which are subordinated cmbs backed by pools of commercial mortgage loans on multifamily  retail  hotel  and other commercial real estate  investments in non core assets  including direct and indirect investments in government insured mortgage backed securities and a limited number of other assets  and trading in cmbs  residential mortgage backed securities  agency debt securities and other fixed income securities 
we also perform mortgage servicing through our servicing subsidiary  criimi mae services limited partnership cmslp 
cmslp performs special servicing on the commercial mortgage loans underlying our subordinated cmbs 
currently  our primary source of revenue and cash is our subordinated cmbs 
we receive cash flows from our investments in subordinated cmbs in connection with payments made on the underlying commercial mortgage loans 
the net interest margin related to our subordinated cmbs is impacted by  among other things  the credit performance of the mortgage loans underlying our subordinated cmbs and the interest expense on our recourse debt 
during late  we undertook a review of the current market for acquisition of subordinated cmbs in preparation for the expected resumption of such acquisition activities in due to a variety of factors such as increased competition in the sector  less attractive investment yields and underwriting standards that are widely believed to be deteriorating due to the surplus of investment capital dedicated to the subordinated cmbs market  we now believe that it is more prudent for us to focus our investment activity in the manufacturing of subordinated cmbs investments rather than pursuing secondary market acquisition opportunities as we have in the past 
by manufacturing we mean directly originating  or purchasing at origination  commercial mortgage loan  and financing these loans via the periodic issuance of investment grade rated cmbs 
this strategy would continue our historical focus on higher yielding tranches of cmbs  but would allow us to better control the risk inherent in such investments by involving the company in the transactions at inception ie at the time the loans are originated 
as a full service commercial mortgage company  we expect to originate  service and securitize commercial mortgage loans which we believe gives us a competitive advantage over other securitized lenders in terms of level of service provided to mortgage loan borrowers and flexibility in addressing borrower needs over the term of their loans 
our aim would be to use securitization as a financing tool to create attractive long term investment yields as opposed to the current market paradigm in which securitization is primarily used to generate short term arbitrage gains on sale 
our goal is to deliver an attractive return on shareholders equity generated by earnings that are sustainable over the long term 
we remain prepared to augment those returns by selectively participating in the subordinated cmbs acquisition market if market conditions warrant 
we currently face certain significant business risks  including those risks related to owning subordinated cmbs and refinancing risks related to our bear stearns debt and bref debt  which mature in january we are currently exploring refinancing alternatives  including  among others  a collateralized debt obligation  to address our refinancing risk 
liquidity and cash flow liquidity is a measurement of our ability to meet potential cash requirements  including ongoing commitments to repay recourse borrowings  fund investments and lending activities and for other general business purposes 
currently  our primary source of funds for liquidity consists of cash flows from our subordinated cmbs and  to a lesser extent  cash flows from our insured mortgage securities  equity investments and mezzanine loans 
our ability to make mortgage related investments  including direct loan originations  depends on  among other things  our ability to engage in such activities under the terms and conditions of the operative documents evidencing our obligations  our internally generated cash flows  available liquidity  and our ability to access additional capital 
factors which could affect our ability to access additional capital include the amount of our debt  among other things  the cost and availability of such capital  the availability of investment product at attractive rates of return  changes in interest rates and interest rate spreads  changes in the commercial mortgage industry and the commercial real estate market  the effects of terrorism  general economic conditions  perceptions in the capital markets of our business  results of our operations  and our financial leverage  financial condition  and business prospects 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to resume mortgage related investments or obtain additional capital  or that the terms of any such capital will be favorable to us 
summary of significant sources and uses of cash related to existing business the following table is a summary of our significant sources and uses of cash during the years ended december  and in millions for the year ended cash received from cmbs rated bb through unrated cash distribution from the aim limited partnerships net cash received from insured mortgage securities cash received from investment in mezzanine loans cash used to service recourse debt principal payments excluding retirement of recourse debt interest payments cash used to pay interest rate swap cash used to pay current and previously deferred preferred dividends cash used to pay executive contract terminations and severance cash used to pay principal and interest on mortgage payable cash used to prepay fannie mae funding note general and administrative expenses bref maintenance fee cash distributions from the aim limited partnerships are primarily a return on investment 
the general and administrative expenses and bref maintenance fee are the amounts as reflected in our consolidated statements of income 
the decrease in cash received from cmbs rated bb through unrated is primarily the result of increased interest shortfalls on our subordinated cmbs resulting from increased defaults  realized losses and appraisal reduction events during as compared to cash flows from our subordinated cmbs will continue to be affected by additional defaults  realized losses  interest shortfalls  master servicer advance recoveries and appraisal reduction amounts on properties underlying our subordinated cmbs 
estimated cumulative losses on our subordinated cmbs  which have been included in our estimated yields  are expected to continue to increase significantly through and will likely result in further decreased cash received from our subordinated cmbs in future years 
also  we currently face uncertainty regarding the potential impact of the outcome of events involving our most significant borrowing relationship as discussed under the caption financial condition summary of cmbs specially serviced mortgage loans 
our future cash flows from our subordinated cmbs  and the related fair value determination of our subordinated cmbs  could be significantly adversely affected if certain loan modifications and servicer reimbursement arrangements are not resolved satisfactorily 
the increase in cash received from the aim limited partnerships which are four publicly traded limited partnerships that hold insured mortgages and whose general partner is one of our subsidiaries is primarily the result of continuing prepayments of the mortgages held by the aim limited partnerships and the resulting distributions to partners  including one of our wholly owned subsidiaries 
in february  three of the four aim limited partnerships were liquidated  accordingly  we received liquidating distributions aggregating approximately million in february we currently expect our cash flows from the aim limited partnerships to remain at a similar level in as compared to due to the liquidations 
for our insured mortgage securities  the net cash received after debt service  which is generally excess interest and prepayment penalties  decreased during due to the significant prepayment of the mortgage securities during and we expect the net cash flows from our insured mortgages to increase during compared to  due to the prepayment of the freddie mac funding note in march and the expected prepayment of the cmo debt by the end of the second quarter of  as discussed below in capital resources non recourse debt  assuming asset balances and libor remain at current levels 
the repayments of the debt will increase our net interest margin related to these assets since we will be replacing higher  fixed rate debt with libor based debt  which is currently lower 
the increase in cash received from our mezzanine loans was primarily the result of the million repayment of one of the loans 
we currently expect the cash flow from our mezzanine loans to decrease in as compared to the principal payments on our recourse debt decreased by approximately million during as compared to primarily due to the refinancing of the exit debt in january the bear stearns debt required quarterly principal amortization payments of million through january  increasing to approximately million per quarter thereafter 
if we complete the anticipated refinancing of the bear stearns debt during  our principal payments could be significantly higher than the existing payments required under the bear stearns debt 
the bref debt does not require principal amortization payments 
during  substantially all of our net cash flows were required to be used to pay principal and interest payments on the exit debt 
the interest payments on our recourse debt decreased by approximately million during due to a lower average coupon rate and lower average balance of our recourse debt following the recapitalization in january we expect our interest payments to decrease further during under our current recourse debt facilities as compared to interest payments  assuming libor remains constant 
if we complete the anticipated refinancing during  our interest payments could be significantly higher than the interest payments currently required under the bear stearns debt 
we made preferred dividend payments of approximately million during the year ended december  following the board s decision to pay all previously deferred preferred stock dividends and current dividends during we expect our total preferred dividend payments to decrease in as compared to since we will only be paying current dividends in as detailed in the table above  we made payments for general and administrative expenses  executive contract terminations and severance  the bref maintenance fee and the interest rate swap during and see further discussion of these income statement items in our discussion of results of operations in compared to compared to net cash provided by operating activities decreased by approximately million to million during as compared to million during the decrease was primarily attributable to us no longer being required to restrict cash due to the retirement of our exit debt  a decrease in cash received from our subordinated cmbs as previously discussed  million paid to certain executives for contract terminations  and million of severance paid to our former chairman and former president 
net cash provided by investing activities increased by approximately million to million during compared to million during the increase was primarily attributable to a million increase in proceeds from insured mortgage security prepayments during  million of proceeds from the prepayment of a mezzanine loan during  million of purchases of investment grade cmbs by cmslp during  partially offset by million of proceeds from the sale of servicing rights during  and a million reduction in proceeds from the sale of investment grade cmbs by cmslp during net cash used in financing activities increased by approximately million to million during compared to million during the increase is primarily attributable to the payment of approximately million in preferred stock dividends during and a million increase in principal payments on the securitized mortgage obligations due to higher insured mortgage security prepayments as discussed previously 
in connection with the january recapitalization  we repaid approximately million of exit debt through the incurrence of an aggregate million of bear stearns and bref debt  the net proceeds of million from the issuance of common stock to bref fund  and million of our available cash and liquid assets 
during  we also paid approximately million of debt issuance costs  primarily in connection with the january recapitalization 
during  we paid million approximately  of which represented accrued and unpaid dividends to redeem the series e preferred stock 
we redeemed all  outstanding shares of the series e preferred stock at the stated redemption price of per share plus accrued and unpaid dividends through and including the date of redemption 
the approximate million difference between the aggregate liquidation value  including preferred stock issuance costs  and the redemption price is reflected as a dividend on preferred stock in compared to net cash provided by operating activities increased by approximately million during as compared to the increase was primarily attributable to net sales of other mbs during compared to net purchases during the results also reflect a decrease in restricted cash and accounts payable and accrued expenses following the settlement of the first union litigation in march the decrease in receivables and other assets reflects the january receipt of funds withheld related to our interest in cmo iv 
the results also reflect a decrease in restricted cash and accounts payable and accrued expenses caused by cash outflows on the april  chapter effective date  including approximately million to pay off accrued interest on debt incurred prior to the chapter filing  million to pay an emergence financing origination fee related to a portion of the exit debt and million to pay accrued payables related to the chapter filing 
net cash provided by investing activities increased by approximately million to million during compared to million during the increase was primarily attributable to a million increase in proceeds from mortgage security prepayments during  million of proceeds from the sale by cmslp of its servicing rights excludes reimbursement of advances  which are included in operating cash flows during  partially offset by net cash of million that cmslp invested in investment grade cmbs during  and million of cash reflected in as a result of the consolidation of cmslp beginning in july net cash used in financing activities decreased by approximately million to million during compared to million during the decrease is primarily attributable to a million decrease in principal payments on our recourse and other non match funded debt  including the exit debt  during  partially offset by million paid to redeem the series e preferred stock  and a million increase in principal payments on the securitized mortgage debt obligations due primarily to higher mortgage security dispositions in the principal payments on recourse debt include approximately million paid on the april  chapter effective date  which was used to pay off a portion of the aggregate principal relating to debt incurred prior to the chapter filing 
capital resources as of december   our total consolidated indebtedness was million of which million was recourse debt  and our shareholders equity was approximately million 
the following discussion summarizes our existing recourse debt  hedging instruments and non recourse debt as of december  recourse debt certain information regarding our existing recourse debt is as follows in thousands face amount current interest rate annual principal payments maturity date bear stearns debt  libor bps  january bref debt  january bear stearns repurchase agreement  varies varies august total recourse debt  the bear stearns debt is collateralized by first direct and or indirect liens on all of our subordinated cmbs  and is subject to a number of terms  conditions and restrictions including margin requirements 
the bref debt is collateralized by an indirect second lien on all of our subordinated cmbs and is not prepayable 
the bear stearns repurchase agreement is collateralized by approximately million of insured mortgage securities as of december  the interest rate under the bear stearns repurchase agreement  which is currently based on one month libor plus basis points  varies by the type of collateral 
the bear stearns repurchase agreement is also subject to liquidity requirements and  in certain instances  margin requirements 
we expect further borrowings under the bear stearns repurchase agreement during  including borrowings in connection with the anticipated repayment of the freddie mac funding note and the cmo debt  as discussed below 
for a discussion of the related risk factors  see business certain risk factors under the caption we are subject to a number of borrowing risks  including refinancing risk and margin calls 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a more detailed description of these borrowing facilities  and see below for a discussion regarding the anticipated refinancing of the bear stearns debt 
hedging instruments the following is a summary of our derivative financial instruments as of december  in thousands notional amount estimated fair value weighted average interest rate maturity date pay fixed interest rate swaps   october  interest rate cap  november  total   we have entered into an interest rate swap agreement to hedge the variability of the future interest payments on the anticipated cdo attributable to changes in interest rates 
our obligations to bear stearns under the interest rate swap documents are collateralized by certain assets as described in note through december   these swaps were treated as cash flow hedges for gaap 
we have entered into three interest rate swap transactions under this agreement in which we agreed to pay bear stearns a weighted average fixed rate of per annum in exchange for floating payments based on one month libor on the total notional amount of million 
these swaps provide for monthly interest payments which commenced november  we intend to terminate the swaps simultaneously with the issuance of the cdo or other refinancing transaction 
we also maintain an interest rate cap indexed to one month libor to partially limit the adverse effects of potential rising interest rates on our variable rate secured debt 
the interest rate cap provides protection to the extent interest rates  based on a readily determinable interest rate index  increase above the stated interest rate cap  in which case we would receive payments based on the difference between the index and the cap 
see business certain risk factors for a discussion of the related risk factors  under the caption our hedging transactions provide limited protection 
non recourse debt our non recourse debt of million as of december  is collateralized  in general  by either our investment grade cmbs or certain of our insured mortgage securities that are pledged to secure the non recourse debt 
principal payments on these obligations are required to the extent of principal payments made on the underlying investment grade cmbs or insured mortgage securities 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of our non recourse debt 
in january  the face amount of our freddie mac funding note was reduced to approximately million due to principal prepayments on the underlying mortgage securities 
since the face value of the debt is less than of the original face value after the january payment  we have the option of prepaying this debt 
we prepaid this debt in march by using million of our cash and borrowing million under the bear stearns repurchase agreement 
we expect to recognize a loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately  during the three months ended march  due to the write off of unamortized discount and deferred fees 
in february  the face amount of the cmo debt was reduced to approximately million due to principal prepayments on the underlying mortgage securities 
since the face value of the debt is less than of the original face value after the february payment  we have the option of prepaying this debt 
we expect to prepay this debt in the second quarter of by borrowing under the bear stearns repurchase agreement  subject to bear s approval  and or selling certain of the mortgage loans that collateralize the cmo debt 
we will recognize a loss on extinguishment of debt upon the repayment of this debt due to the write off of unamortized discount and deferred fees 
anticipated refinancing of bear stearns debt we continue to explore a refinancing of the bear stearns debt during for a discussion of the related risk factors  see business certain risk factors under the caption we are subject to a number of borrowing risks  including refinancing risk and margin calls 
summary of contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  for debt obligations  the table presents the contractual principal payments 
payments due by period in thousands total thereafter long term debt recourse to criimi mae    non recourse to criimi mae a     operating lease obligations     purchase obligations severance obligations totals      a most of these obligations relate to our securitized mortgage obligations 
payments of principal on the securitized mortgage obligations are required to the extent mortgage principal is received on the related collateral 
the projected principal payments on the securitized mortgage obligations are based on the stated terms of the underlying mortgages 
we have entered into employment agreements with three of our senior executive officers 
significant contract provisions include minimum annual base salaries  guaranteed minimum bonus payments and stock awards 
these contracts are primarily at will employment agreements  under which we or the executive may terminate employment for any reason or no reason 
if we terminate any of these executives without cause  then we are obligated to pay the executive as specified in their individual contracts 
as of december   minimum aggregate severance payments payable by us was approximately  results of operations compared to financial statement net loss to common shareholders for the years ended december  and was approximately million and million  respectively 
the significant reduction in net loss in as compared to was primarily the result of million of impairment charges related to certain subordinated cmbs that were recognized during compared to impairment charges of million that were recognized during results include approximately million of impairment charges related to certain subordinated cmbs  approximately million of net gain on extinguishment of debt  approximately million of recapitalization expenses  approximately million in executive contract termination expenses  approximately million of additional amortization expense on collateralized mortgage obligations  approximately million in hedge ineffectiveness expense  and approximately million of additional interest expense during the day redemption notice period for the series a and series b senior secured notes 
results include approximately million of impairment charges related to certain subordinated cmbs  an approximate million non cash charge to write off goodwill upon the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards or sfas no 
 approximately million from the gain on the sale by cmslp of master and direct servicing rights  approximately million of additional amortization expense on collateralized mortgage obligations  approximately million of recapitalization expenses  and approximately million reflected as an additional dividend on preferred stock in connection with the redemption of the series e preferred stock representing the difference between the aggregate liquidation value  including the initial preferred stock issuance costs  and the redemption price 
net interest margin net interest margin increased by approximately million to million during compared to million during  primarily due to reduced borrowing costs related to the january recapitalization  partially offset by additional interest expense related to discount amortization of our collateralized mortgage obligations  as discussed below 
interest income cmbs interest income from investment grade cmbs did not change significantly during as compared to interest income from subordinated cmbs decreased by approximately million  or  to million during as compared to million during  primarily due to changes in our loss estimates related to cmbs during and and the resulting reduction in interest income on cmbs 
gaap require that yields on cmbs be recalculated and revised as estimated future cash flows change 
the revised yield on cmbs is based on the current amortized cost adjusted for impairment and the revised future cash flows  including the assumed timing and amount of future defaults and credit losses 
the revised weighted average yield as of january    and was  and  respectively 
the effective interest method of recognizing interest income on cmbs results in income recognition that differs from cash received 
for the year ended december   we recognized approximately million of discount amortization  partially offset by approximately million of cash received in excess of income recognized on subordinated cmbs due to the effective interest method 
for the year ended december   we recognized approximately million of discount amortization  partially offset by approximately million of cash received in excess of income recognized on subordinated cmbs due to the effective interest method 
the net effect of the discount amortization and the cash received in excess of income is an adjustment to the basis of our subordinated cmbs 
interest income insured mortgage securities interest income from insured mortgage securities decreased by approximately million  or  to million during from million during this decrease was principally due to the prepayment or sale of approximately of the total insured mortgage portfolio from december  through december  the prepayment activity corresponds with the low mortgage interest rate environment during this period 
these prepayments result in corresponding reductions in the outstanding principal balances of the collateralized mortgage obligations insured mortgage securities and the related interest expense 
interest expense interest expense of approximately million for was lower than the interest expense of approximately million for the decrease is attributable to a lower average debt balance during million compared to million  and a lower average effective interest rate on total debt outstanding during compared to 
these decreases were partially offset by additional amortization on the collateralized mortgage obligations as discussed below 
the overall weighted average effective interest rate on the bear stearns debt and bref debt was for the year ended december   and the weighted average coupon pay rate on the bear stearns debt and bref debt was  reflecting the significant reduction in borrowing costs related to the january recapitalization 
the difference in the weighted average effective interest rate and the weighted average pay rate primarily relates to our deferral of two thirds of the interest on the bref debt during the first months of the bref debt 
the weighted average effective interest rate on the exit debt was for the year ended december  the weighted average pay rate on the exit debt was during the same period 
on january   we deposited amounts with the indenture trustee to pay all principal and interest on our outstanding series a and series b senior secured notes on the march  redemption date 
this redemption required deposit of the redemption amount days prior to the actual redemption of the notes 
the day notice period resulted in approximately million of additional interest expense during the period january  through march  since the bear stearns debt  bref debt  and the series a and b secured notes were outstanding at the same time 
interest expense on the collateralized mortgage obligations insured mortgage securities decreased following significant prepayments of mortgages underlying the insured mortgage securities  as discussed previously 
this decrease in interest expense was partially offset by approximately million of additional discount and deferred fees amortization expenses during  which are reflected as interest expense  compared to approximately million of additional amortization expenses during the increase in amortization is the result of the mortgages prepaying faster than anticipated and increases in our assumed prepayment speed which  under the effective interest method of recognizing interest expense  required an adjustment to cumulative amortization recorded through interest expense 
during the years ended december  and  we recognized hedge expense of approximately million and million  respectively  on our interest rate caps 
our interest rate cap  which matured on november  which we purchased in april  set one month libor at a rate of 
on october   we purchased an interest rate cap with a notional amount of million  maturity on november   and capping one month libor at 
as of december   the one month libor rate was 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased by approximately million to million during as compared to million during primarily due to an increase in professional fees incurred in connection with the interest rate swap and related netting agreement and corporate governance compliance due to the sarbanes oxley act of  and an increase in salary expenses 
we expect a reduction in general and administrative expenses during  excluding any additional general and administrative expenses that may result from our new business initiatives  primarily due to anticipated decreases in corporate legal fees and the realignment of executive cash compensation 
we are currently estimating general and administrative expenses to be million during  excluding any additional general and administrative expenses that may result from our new business initiatives 
mortgage servicing the following is a summary of the consolidated results of operations of cmslp in thousands year ended december  description servicing revenue   servicing general and administrative expenses   servicing amortization  depreciation and impairment   servicing restructuring expenses servicing gain on sale of servicing rights  servicing loss gain on sale of investment grade cmbs gaap net loss income from cmslp   the net loss from cmslp of million for the year compares to the net income from cmslp of million for cmslp s results include a million gain from the sale of servicing rights 
cmslp s total revenue decreased by approximately million  or  to approximately million during this decrease is primarily the result of reduced mortgage  servicing income  other servicing revenue and interest income earned on cash and investments 
general and administrative expenses were million and million during and  respectively 
the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to increased expenses related to additional resources dedicated to special servicing resolutions and severance payments made in connection with managerial changes 
during  amortization  depreciation and impairment was approximately million as compared to million during this  decrease was primarily the result of accelerated prepayments on the aim limited partnerships insured mortgages and a lower balance of depreciable assets in as compared to  which reduced amortization expense 
during and  the aim limited partnerships experienced a significant amount of prepayments of their insured mortgages which reduced cmslp s cash flows from its sub advisory contracts with the aim limited partnerships 
as a result  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we evaluated cmslp s investment in the sub advisory contracts for impairment 
we reduced the value of cmslp s investment in the sub advisory contracts with the aim limited partnerships and recorded an impairment charge of approximately  and  during and  respectively 
in april  we restructured cmslp s property servicing group resulting in the termination of employees 
in conjunction with this restructuring  we have outsourced substantially all of our contractual property servicing duties related to the labor intensive tasks of financial statement collection and analysis and property inspection performance 
the outsourcing was completed in february this outsourcing does not relieve us of any of our contractual obligations or reduce any of our rights as property servicer  since cmslp remains the property servicer of record  but it does relieve us of the administrative task of collecting financial operating data 
this will allow the remaining resources in surveillance to focus more on collateral analysis 
for the outsourced loans  cmslp coordinates the delivery of monthly reports and inspections with the third party servicers 
for the portfolios for which the third party servicer is not also the master servicer  cmslp reviews and approves the reports from these servicers prior to submission by cmslp to the trustees 
in february  cmslp sold all of its rights and obligations under its cmbs master and direct servicing contracts primarily because the contracts were not profitable  given the relatively small volume of master and direct cmbs servicing that cmslp was performing 
this sale resulted in a gain of approximately million during the year ended december  in connection with this restructuring  employee positions were eliminated 
during  net restructuring expenses of approximately  were recorded primarily to account for vacant office space that was taking longer to sublease than originally anticipated 
income tax benefit expense during  we recorded an income tax benefit of approximately  during  we recorded income tax expense of approximately  during  approximately million of income tax expense was recognized as a result of the gain on the sale by cmslp of its cmbs master and direct servicing rights 
this tax expense of million was partially offset by tax refunds that were not previously accrued of approximately  that were recognized during the income tax benefit expense was recognized by our trss that own the partnership interests in cmslp 
these trss are separately taxable entities that cannot use our net operating loss carryforward to reduce their taxable income 
the income tax benefit expense that was recognized by our trss was the result of cmslp s financial results 
equity in earnings losses from investments total equity in earnings losses from investments of approximately  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  includes our net equity from the aim limited partnerships and the net equity from our limited partnership interest in the advisor to the aim limited partnerships during these periods 
the and results also include impairment charges on our equity investment in the advisor to the aim limited partnerships 
these impairment charges of  and  relate to significant prepayments of the insured mortgages in the aim limited partnerships portfolios during the years ended december  and  respectively 
on a comparative basis  the net equity from the aim limited partnerships decreased primarily due to a reduction in the aim limited partnerships mortgage assets 
three of the aim limited partnerships aim  aim and aim were liquidated in february  resulting in an aggregate liquidating distribution to us of approximately million 
other income other income decreased by approximately million to million during from million during this decrease was primarily attributable to lower interest income earned on reduced cash balances during as compared to we own a shopping center in orlando  florida  which we account for as real estate owned 
the following is a summary of the financial results of the shopping center in thousands years ended december  interest expense depreciation expense other  net net loss the other  net amount is included in other income 
interest expense and depreciation expense are included in their respective captions in our consolidated statements of income 
we have been working to reposition and stabilize this asset to increase its value  although we are also considering other alternatives 
impairment on subordinated cmbs impairment on subordinated cmbs decreased to million during compared to million during as of december   the projected loss severities of certain of the underlying mortgage loans have increased which has resulted in an increase in our overall expected loss estimate related to our subordinated cmbs to million 
this revision to the overall expected loss estimate is primarily the result of increased projected losses due to lower internal estimates of values on properties underlying certain mortgage loans and real estate owned by underlying trusts  and  in some cases  changes in the timing of resolution and disposition of certain specially serviced assets  which when combined  has resulted in higher projected loss severities on certain loans and real estate owned by underlying trusts currently or anticipated to be in special servicing 
the primary reasons for lower estimates of value include the poor performance of certain properties and related markets and changes to workout negotiations due  in large part  to the softness in the economy and the lag typically associated with real estate fundamentals  the continued slowdown in travel and  in some cases  over supply of hotel properties  and a shift in retail activity in some markets 
there can be no assurance that our revised overall expected loss estimate of million will not be exceeded as a result of additional or adverse events or circumstances 
as we determined that there had been an adverse change in expected future cash flows  we believed some of our subordinated cmbs had been impaired under eitf and sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  as of june   september  and december  as the fair values of the impaired subordinated cmbs aggregated approximately million  million and million below the amortized cost basis as of june   september  and december   respectively  we recorded other than temporary impairment charges aggregating million through the income statement of these same amounts during the second  third and fourth quarters of the impairment charges reduced our basis in those impaired bonds see also interest income cmbs 
during  we also revised our overall expected loss estimate related to our subordinated cmbs 
the revisions to the overall expected loss estimate during were primarily the result of the same factors as those described above 
as we determined that there had been an adverse change in expected future cash flows  we believed some of our cmbs had been impaired during and recorded other than temporary impairment charges aggregating million through the income statement during for further discussion of our loss estimate see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial condition summary of cmbs 
bref maintenance fee pursuant to the investment agreement with brascan real estate financial investments llc  which we refer to as bref investments  we are obligated to pay bref investments a quarterly maintenance fee of  through january the expense of approximately million during represents the maintenance fee for the period january through december  hedge ineffectiveness expense as previously stated  during  we entered into a total of three interest rate swaps to hedge the variability of the future interest payments on the anticipated cdo attributable to future changes in interest rates 
through december   these swaps are treated as cash flow hedges for gaap 
under these swaps  we agreed to pay bear stearns a weighted average fixed interest rate of per annum in exchange for floating rate payments based on one month libor on the total notional amount of million 
these swaps were effective on october   terminate on october  and provide for monthly interest payments commencing november  on november   we began making monthly payments to bear stearns equal to the difference between the weighted average swap rate of per annum and the then current one month libor rate  on the notional amount of million 
we made actual payments of approximately  during the interest rate swaps were designated to hedge future interest payments on the anticipated cdo 
as the expected date of the cdo has changed  we recognized approximately million of hedge ineffectiveness during the year ended december   in accordance with sfas no 
the million expense represents the present value of the expected payments during the period of delay 
we have an asset of approximately million in other assets as of december   representing the aggregate fair value of the interest rate swaps 
during the first quarter of  we have started exploring other refinancing alternatives  including the cdo 
as a result  we will begin reflecting changes in the fair value of the swaps through earnings as hedge ineffectiveness in executive contract termination costs in august  the employment contracts for former executive officers david iannarone and brian hanson  and cynthia azzara expired and were not renewed 
these contracts were put into place in to ensure management continuity following our emergence from chapter proceedings and through our january recapitalization 
in connection with the contract terminations  we recognized approximately million of executive contract termination expenses for each of mr 
iannarone and ms 
azzara and approximately  of executive contract termination expense related to severance and related benefit payments for mr

dockser and willoughby 
we consolidated our office space in connection with our january recapitalization and  as a result  we recorded approximately  of expense for vacant office space during the accrual for the vacant space represents the fair value of lease payments through  a tenant improvement allowance and a broker commission  all net of estimated sublease revenue in accordance with sfas no 
during  we recognized approximately million of recapitalization expenses related to the services performed by our investment banking firm during the initial stages of our exploration of strategic alternatives 
net gain on extinguishment of debt during the three months ended march   we reversed approximately million of accrued extension fees related to the exit debt since the debt was repaid and the extension fees were no longer payable 
this reversal is reflected as a gain on extinguishment of debt in our consolidated statement of income 
this reversal was partially offset by approximately  of breakage fee paid to the lender of the exit variable rate secured borrowing and legal fees of approximately  resulting in a net gain on extinguishment of debt of million 
in december  we repaid our fannie mae funding note  which had a unpaid principal balance of approximately million by using approximately million available under our million repurchase facility with bear stearns and approximately million of our cash 
in connection with the funding note repayment  we recognized a  loss on extinguishment of debt for the write off of unamortized bond discount and deferred financing fees

under sfas no 
 the method for testing goodwill for impairment occurs at the reporting segment level as defined in sfas no 
and is performed using a fair value based approach 
sfas no 
was effective for us on january  effective upon adoption on january   we wrote off our goodwill and recorded a resulting impairment charge of approximately million for this change in accounting principle 
the goodwill relates to the portfolio investment reporting segment as defined in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the fair value of the reporting segment was determined using a market capitalization approach  and the impairment was primarily a result of the significant decrease in the price of our common stock price since the merger of certain mortgage businesses affiliated with cri  inc into criimi mae in this change in accounting principle reduced our annual amortization expense by approximately million through june the pro forma net income and pro forma earnings per share disclosures in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements present our net income and earnings per share as if this accounting principle had been applied to those periods presented

net operating loss for tax purposes 
we generated a net operating loss for tax purposes of approximately million during the year ended december  compared to a net operating loss of approximately million during the year ended december  as a result of our trader election in early  we recognized a mark to market tax loss of approximately million on certain trading assets on january  the january loss was recognized evenly from through for tax purposes approximately million per year

the significant change in the results from was primarily the result of million of impairment charges related to certain subordinated cmbs that were recognized during compared to impairment charges of million that were recognized during results include approximately million of impairment charges related to certain subordinated cmbs  an approximate million non cash charge to write off goodwill  approximately million from the gain on the sale by cmslp of master and direct servicing rights  approximately million reflected as an additional dividend on preferred stock in connection with the redemption of the series e preferred stock representing the difference between the aggregate liquidation value  including the initial preferred stock issuance costs  and the redemption price  and approximately million of additional amortization expense on collateralized mortgage obligations 
results include approximately million of impairment charges related to certain subordinated cmbs  approximately million of net revenue due to the effect of changes in accounting principles  primarily a change in accounting for servicing revenue  an aggregate of approximately million of expenses relating to the chapter reorganization  approximately million of amortization that was recorded during the year ended december  on the goodwill written off on january   and approximately  of additional amortization expense on collateralized mortgage obligations 
net interest margin net interest margin decreased by approximately million to million during compared to million during  primarily due to a reduction in income from subordinated cmbs following decreases in the amortized cost of the subordinated cmbs  and an increase in additional interest expense related to discount amortization of our collateralized mortgage obligations 
these items are discussed in further detail below 
interest income cmbs interest income from investment grade cmbs did not change significantly during as compared to interest income from subordinated cmbs decreased by approximately million  or  to million during as compared to million during primarily due to changes in our loss estimates related to cmbs during and and the resulting reduction in interest income on cmbs

the effective interest method of recognizing interest income on cmbs results in income recognition that differs from cash received 
for the year ended december  we recognized approximately million of discount amortization  partially offset by approximately million of cash received in excess of income recognized on subordinated cmbs due to the effective interest method 
for the year ended december   we recognized approximately million of discount amortization  partially offset by approximately million of cash received in excess of income recognized on subordinated cmbs due to the effective interest method 
the net effect of the discount amortization and the cash received in excess of income is an adjustment to the basis of our subordinated cmbs 
interest income insured mortgage securities interest income from insured mortgage securities decreased by approximately million  or  to million during from million during this decrease was principally due to the prepayment of approximately of the total insured mortgage portfolio from december  through december  this prepayment activity corresponded with the low mortgage interest rate environment during this period 
these prepayments resulted in corresponding reductions in the outstanding principal balances of the collateralized mortgage obligations insured mortgage securities and the related interest expense 
interest expense interest expense of approximately million for was approximately million lower than the interest expense of approximately million for the decrease is attributable to a lower average debt balance during million compared to billion  partially offset by a higher average effective interest rate on total debt outstanding during compared to 
interest expense on the collateralized mortgage obligations insured mortgage securities decreased following significant prepayments of mortgages underlying the insured mortgage securities  which was partially offset by approximately million of additional discount and deferred cost amortization expenses during these additional amortization expenses are the result of the mortgages prepaying faster than previously anticipated and increases in our assumed prepayment speed during which  under the effective interest method of recognizing interest expense  required an adjustment to cumulative interest expense 
the overall weighted average effective interest rate and weighted average coupon rate on the exit debt was and  respectively  during the overall weighted average effective interest rate and weighted average coupon rate on the exit debt was and  respectively  for the period april  to december  the difference in the exit debt s weighted average effective interest rate and the weighted average coupon rate primarily related to the accrual of estimated extension fees and the accrued interest related to the per annum  accreting interest on the series b senior secured notes  both of which are included in the weighted average effective interest rate  but not included in the weighted average coupon rate

cmslp s total revenue decreased by approximately million to approximately million during compared to million during includes full year results 
this decrease is primarily the result of the sale of servicing rights which reduced mortgage servicing income and interest income earned on the escrow balances  partially offset by higher revenue from special servicing 
general and administrative expenses were million and million includes full year results during the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to the staff reductions that occurred in the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of following cmslp s sale of its cmbs master and direct servicing contracts  as discussed below 
during  amortization  depreciation and impairment was approximately million as compared to million includes full year results during this million decrease was primarily the result of the sale of servicing rights  which reduced amortization expense  and lower impairment on cmbs held by cmslp during as compared to the decrease was partially offset by an impairment charge of approximately  that was recorded on cmslp s investment in aim limited partnerships sub advisory contracts during see a discussion of this impairment charge in the discussion of compared to 
as previously discussed  in february  cmslp sold all of its rights and obligations under its cmbs master and direct servicing contracts 
a restructuring charge of approximately  was recorded during the fourth quarter of to account for employee severance costs  non cancelable lease costs  and other costs related to the restructuring 
during  additional net restructuring expenses of approximately  were recorded primarily to account for vacant office space that was taking longer to sublease than originally anticipated 
cmslp received approximately million in cash  which included reimbursement of servicing advances  in connection with this sale 
equity in earnings losses from investments total equity in earnings losses from investments for and included our net equity from the aim limited partnerships and the net equity from our limited partnership interest in the advisor to the aim limited partnerships  and includes net equity from cmslp cmsi for the six months ended june  since cmslp s operations were consolidated effective july  
in addition  as discussed below  the results include an impairment charge on our equity investment in the advisor to the aim limited partnerships 
on a comparative basis  the net equity from the aim limited partnerships decreased primarily due to a reduction in the aim limited partnerships mortgage assets 
as previously discussed  during  the aim limited partnerships experienced a significant amount of prepayments of their insured mortgages 
these prepayments reduced cash flows on our investment in the advisor to the aim limited partnerships 
as a result  the advisor to the aim limited partnerships evaluated its investment in the advisory contracts for impairment 
the advisor reduced the value of its investment in the advisory contracts to the aim limited partnerships and recorded an impairment charge 
we recorded our portion of the impairment charge  totaling approximately  as of december  this impairment charge is included in equity in earnings losses from investments in our consolidated statement of income 
this investment is included in our portfolio investment segment

this tax expense of million was partially offset by tax refunds that were not previously accrued of approximately  that were recognized during the income tax expense was incurred by our trss that own the partnership interests in cmslp  which are separate taxable entities that cannot use our net operating loss carryforward to reduce their taxable income 
the income tax benefit that was recognized by our trss during was the result of the net loss incurred by cmslp during the period july through december other income other income decreased by approximately million to million during from million during this decrease was primarily attributable to lower interest income earned on reduced cash balances during as compared to  partially offset by an increase in net income before interest expense and depreciation expense from a shopping center that we account for as real estate owned  as discussed below 
in october  one of our wholly owned subsidiaries acquired certain partnership interests in a partnership that was the obligor on a mezzanine loan payable to us in exchange for curing a default on the first mortgage loan through a cash payment of approximately  this partnership and another of our wholly owned subsidiaries own of the partnership interests in the partnership which is the obligor on the first mortgage loan 
the first mortgage loan is secured by a shopping center in orlando  florida 
as a result of this acquisition  we own of the partnership interests and are consolidating the partnership s financial results as of october  we account for these assets as real estate owned  and the real estate is being held for investment 
the following is a summary of the financial results of the shopping center in thousands years ended december  interest expense depreciation expense other  net net loss impairment on subordinated cmbs impairment on subordinated cmbs increased to million during compared to million during although the total amount of loans in special servicing only increased slightly from million as of december  to million as of december   the amount of estimated total mortgage loan defaults had increased  the projected loss severities of the underlying mortgage loans currently or anticipated to be in special servicing had increased  and the timing of certain projected losses was anticipated to occur sooner than previously estimated  all of which resulted in an increase in our overall expected loss estimate related to our subordinated cmbs portfolio to million as of december  the revisions to the overall expected loss estimate during were primarily the result of increased projected loan losses due to lower than anticipated appraisals and lower internal estimates of values on real estate owned by underlying trusts and properties underlying certain defaulted mortgage loans  which  when combined with the updated loss severity experience and increased expectation of defaults  resulted in higher projected loss severities on mortgage loans and real estate owned by underlying trusts currently or anticipated to be in special servicing 
primary reasons for lower appraisals and lower estimates of value resulting in higher projected loss severities on mortgage loans included the poor performance of certain properties and related markets  failed workout negotiations  and extended time needed to liquidate assets due  in large part  to the continued softness in the economy  the continued downturn in travel and  in some cases  over supply of hotel properties  and a shift in retail activity in some markets  including the closing of stores by certain national and regional retailers 
in addition  two significant hotel portfolios transferred into special servicing in early january the unpaid principal balances of these two hotel portfolios aggregated approximately million 
since we determined that there had been an adverse change in expected future cash flows  we believed some of our subordinated cmbs had been impaired as of june   september  and december  as the fair values of the impaired subordinated cmbs aggregated approximately million  million and million below the amortized cost basis as of june   september  and december   respectively  we recorded other than temporary impairment charges through the income statement aggregating million during the second  third and fourth quarters of the impairment charges reduced our basis in those impaired bonds see also interest income cmbs 
during  we also revised our overall expected loss estimate related to our subordinated cmbs portfolio 
the revisions to the overall expected loss estimate during were primarily the result of the continued slowing us economy and recession exacerbated by the terrorist attacks on september  and subsequent threats of terrorism  which were principal causes of greater than previously anticipated monetary defaults on the underlying mortgage loans and lower than previously anticipated appraisal amounts on properties underlying certain defaulted loans 
these factors increased the estimated principal loss on the mortgage loans 
as we determined that there had been an adverse change in expected future cash flows  we believed some of our subordinated cmbs had been impaired during as the fair value of the impaired subordinated cmbs was below the amortized cost during  we recorded other than temporary impairment charges through the income statement aggregating million during reorganization items during  we recorded reorganization items due to the chapter filings of criimi mae inc  criimi mae management  inc  and criimi mae holdings ii  lp as follows in thousands short term interest income  professional fees  other net recovery on real estate owned total reorganization expense  net  we did not recognize any reorganization expense in emergence financing origination fee in connection with the emergence from chapter in april  we paid a one time  emergence financing origination fee of approximately million related to the exit variable rate secured borrowing 
this fee was required to be expensed immediately under gaap 
cumulative effect of adoption of sfas see discussion of this item in compared to 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle related to servicing revenue as of july   cmslp changed its accounting policy related to the recognition of special servicing fee revenue 
special servicing fees are paid to cmslp when mortgage loans collateralizing our cmbs are in default 
historically  cmslp had deferred special servicing fee revenue and recorded that revenue into earnings using the method consistent with our policy of recognizing interest income over the life of our cmbs on the level yield basis 
cmslp changed its accounting policy to recognize the special servicing fees in earnings on a current basis as we believe this policy better matches the special servicing fees cmslp earns with the direct costs expended for performing its special servicing obligations 
the cmbs and special servicing contracts are separate legal instruments or contracts 
we were required to reflect this change in accounting principle as a cumulative catch up as of january  as of january   cmslp had approximately million in deferred revenue related to the special servicing fee revenue 
as a result  this amount was recorded in income and reflected as a cumulative change in accounting principle for the year ended december  the results of operations for the year ended december  reflect the recognition of special servicing fee revenue on a current basis 
as previously discussed  prior to july   cmslp was accounted for using the equity method and  as a result  the impact of the new accounting principle except for the cumulative catch up is reflected in equity in earnings losses from investments for the six months ended june  and on a consolidated basis for the six months ended december  net operating loss for tax purposes we generated a net operating loss for tax purposes of approximately million for the year ended december  compared to a net operating loss of approximately million in  as follows in millions january loss less amounts recognized in less amounts recognized in less amounts recognized in balance remaining of january  loss to be recognized in future periods taxable income for the year before recognition of january loss less january loss recognized plus mark to market unrealized loss on trading securities net operating loss accumulated net operating loss through january net operating loss created during the year net operating loss utilization net operating loss carried forward for use in future periods taxable income for the year ended december  includes an approximate million loss on certain trading securities in connection with the transfer of certain trading securities on april  to cbo reit following the reorganization effected to facilitate the collateral structure for the exit debt 
assets transferred to cbo reit and subsequently transferred to cbo reit ii in january are no longer required to be marked to market on a tax basis 
financial condition summary of cash position and shareholders equity as of december   our cash and cash equivalents aggregated approximately million  including approximately million held by cmslp 
in addition to our cash  we had additional liquidity at december  comprised of million in other mbs which are included elsewhere in our balance sheet 
as of march   our liquidity included approximately million of cash and cash equivalents and approximately million of other mbs 
as of december  and  shareholders equity was approximately million or per diluted share and approximately million or per diluted share  respectively 
the decrease in book value per diluted share is primarily the result of the common shares issued in connection with the january recapitalization 
these diluted book value per share amounts are based on shareholders equity presented in accordance with gaap 
the december amounts include  among other things  approximately million of net assets related to our cmbs rated a through bbb  which we do not actually own  but are required by gaap to be included on our balance sheet see summary of cmbs below for a further discussion 
these investment grade cmbs  which aggregate approximately million at december   are reflected at fair value and the related match funded debt  which aggregates approximately million at december   is reflected at amortized cost  in each case in accordance with gaap 
summary of cmbs as of december   our assets  in accordance with gaap  include cmbs with an aggregate face amount of approximately billion rated from a to d and unrated 
such cmbs had an aggregate fair value of approximately million representing approximately of our total consolidated assets and an aggregate amortized cost of approximately million 
such cmbs represent investments in securities issued in connection with cbo  cbo and nomura asset securities corporation series d or nomura

as indicated in footnote to the table below  gaap requires both these assets reflected as cmbs pledged to secure securitized mortgage obligation cmbs and their related liabilities reflected as collateralized bond obligations cmbs to be reflected on our balance sheet 
as of december   the fair value of these assets as reflected in our balance sheet was approximately million and the amortized cost of the debt as reflected in our balance sheet was approximately million 
all cash flows related to the investment grade cmbs are used to service the corresponding securitized mortgage obligations 
as a result  we currently receive no cash flows from the investment grade cmbs 
as of december   the weighted average pay rate and the loss adjusted weighted average life based on face amount of the investment grade securities was and years  respectively 
the weighted average pay rate and the loss adjusted weighted average life based on face amount of the bb through unrated cmbs securities  sometimes referred to as the retained portfolio  were and years  respectively

as of december   the fair values of the b  ccc  d and the unrated issuer s equity were derived primarily from interest cash flow anticipated to be received since our current loss expectation assumes that the full principal amount of these securities will not be recovered 
see also advance limitations  appraisal reductions and losses on cmbs below 
the cmbs experience interest shortfalls when the weighted average net coupon rate on the underlying cmbs is less than the weighted average stated coupon payments on our subordinated cmbs 
such interest shortfalls will continue to accumulate until they are repaid through either excess interest and or recoveries on the underlying cmbs or a re characterization of principal cash flows  in which case they may be realized as a loss of principal on the subordinated cmbs 
such anticipated losses  including shortfalls  have been taken into consideration in the calculations of fair market values and yields to maturity used to recognize interest income as of december  the unrated issuer s equity subordinated cmbs from cbo and cbo currently do not have a stated coupon rate since these securities are only entitled to the residual cash flow payments  if any  remaining after paying the securities with a higher payment priority 
as a result  effective coupon rates on these securities are highly sensitive to the monthly cash flow payments received from the underlying cmbs that represent the collateral for cbo and cbo in connection with cbo  million currently a rated and million currently bbb rated face amount of investment grade cmbs were sold with call options and million currently a rated face amount were sold without call options 
also in connection with cbo  in may  we initially retained million currently bbb rated and million currently bbb rated face amount of cmbs  both with call options  with the intention to sell these cmbs at a later date 
such sale occurred march  since we retained call options on certain sold cmbs currently rated a  bbb and bbb bonds  we did not surrender control of these cmbs pursuant to the requirements of sfas no 
 and thus these cmbs are accounted for as a financing and not a sale 
since the cbo transaction is recorded as a partial financing and a partial sale  we are deemed to have retained these cmbs with call options issued in connection with cbo  from which we currently receive no cash flows  and are required to reflect them as cmbs on the balance sheet 
amortized cost reflects approximately million of impairment charges related to the unrated issuer s equity bonds in cbo and nomura  and the ccc bond and the d bond in cbo  which were recognized during the year ended december  these impairment charges are in addition to the cumulative impairment charges of approximately million that were recognized through december  see discussion of the impairment charges in impairment on cmbs 
see notes and to notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding the subordinated cmbs for tax purposes 
as of december   the aggregate fair values of the cbo  cbo and nomura bonds were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
as a result of the estimated loss of principal on these cmbs  the fair values and discount rates of these cmbs are based on a loss adjusted yield to maturity 
although the principal balance of the d bond in cbo is expected to be outstanding for approximately years  the bond is not expected to receive any cash flows beyond the next months 
in november  the b bond in cbo was downgraded to d by standard poor s 
determination of fair value of cmbs our determination of fair values for our cmbs portfolio is a process that requires significant judgements and estimates 
the process begins with the compilation and evaluation of pricing information such as nominal spreads to us treasury securities or nominal yields that  in our view  is commensurate with the market s perception of value and risk of comparable assets 
we use a variety of sources to compile such pricing information including i recent offerings and or secondary trades of comparable cmbs ie  securities comparable to our cmbs and or to the cmbs or collateral underlying our cmbs issued in connection with cbo and cbo  ii communications with dealers and active cmbs investors and or advisors regarding the pricing and valuation of our securities and comparable securities  iii institutionally available research reports  iv analyses prepared by the nationally recognized rating organizations responsible for the initial rating assessment and on going surveillance of such cmbs  and v other qualitative and quantitative factors that may impact the value of the cmbs such as the market s perception of the issuers of the cmbs and the credit fundamentals of the commercial properties securing each pool of underlying commercial mortgage loans 
we make further adjustments to such pricing information based on our specific knowledge of our cmbs and the impact of relevant events  which is then used to determine the fair value of our cmbs using a discounted cash flow approach 
expected future gross cash flows are discounted at assumed market yields for our cmbs rated a through b  depending on the rating 
the fair value for those cmbs incurring principal losses and interest shortfalls ie  b rated bonds through our unrated issuer s equity based on our overall expected loss estimate are valued at a loss adjusted yield to maturity that  in our view  is commensurate with the market s perception of the value and risk of comparable securities  using a discounted cash flow approach 
such anticipated principal losses and interest shortfalls  as well as the timing and amount of potential recoveries of such shortfalls  are critical estimates and have been taken into consideration in the calculation of fair values and yields to maturity used to recognize interest income as of december  we have disclosed the range of discount rates by rating category used in determining the fair values as of december  in the table above 
the liquidity of the subordinated cmbs market has historically been limited 
additionally  during adverse market conditions  the liquidity of such market has been severely limited 
for this reason  among others  management s estimate of the value of our subordinated cmbs could vary significantly from the value that could be realized in a current transaction 
mortgage loan pool we have billion and billion of seasoned commercial mortgage loans underlying our subordinated cmbs as of december  and  respectively 
this decline in unpaid principal balance is primarily due to prepayments  pay offs at maturity and liquidations of certain underlying mortgage loans  and to a lesser extent  normal loan amortization related to the underlying mortgage loans 
the commercial mortgage loans are secured by properties of the types and in the geographic locations identified below property type percentage i geographic location ii percentage i retail california multifamily texas hotel florida office pennsylvania other iv new york total other iii total i based on a percentage of the total unpaid principal balance of the underlying loans 
ii no significant concentration by region 
iii no other individual state makes up more than of the total 
iv our ownership interest in one of the cmbs transactions underlying cbo includes subordinated cmbs in which our exposure to losses arising from certain healthcare and senior housing mortgage loans is limited by other subordinated cmbs referred to herein as the subordinated healthcare senior housing cmbs 
these other cmbs are not owned by us and are subordinate to our cmbs in this transaction 
as a result  our investment in such underlying cmbs will only be affected if interest shortfalls and or realized losses on such healthcare and senior housing mortgage loans are in excess of the other subordinated healthcare senior housing cmbs 
we currently estimate that the interest shortfalls and or realized losses on such healthcare and senior housing mortgage loans will exceed the subordinated healthcare senior housing cmbs 
the principal balance of the subordinated healthcare senior housing cmbs as of december  is approximately million 
as of december  the aggregate principal balance of healthcare and senior housing mortgage loans  underlying the subordinated healthcare senior housing cmbs  that are specially serviced by another special servicer  and therefore not in our special servicing loan balance  is approximately million 
specially serviced mortgage loans cmslp performs special servicing on the loans underlying our subordinated cmbs 
a special servicer typically provides asset management and resolution services with respect to nonperforming or underperforming loans within a pool of mortgage loans 
when serving as special servicer of a mortgage loan pool  cmslp has the authority  subject to certain restrictions in the applicable cmbs pooling and servicing documents  to deal directly with any borrower that fails to perform under certain terms of its mortgage loan  including the failure to make payments  and to manage any loan workouts and foreclosures 
as special servicer  cmslp earns fee income on services provided in connection with any loan servicing function transferred to it from the master servicer 
we believe that because we own the first loss unrated or lowest rated bond of virtually all of the cmbs transactions underlying our subordinated cmbs  we have an incentive to efficiently and effectively resolve any loan workouts 
as of december  and  specially serviced mortgage loans included in the commercial mortgage loans described above are as follows specially serviced loans due to monetary default a million million specially serviced loans due to covenant default other million million total specially serviced loans b  million million percentage of total mortgage loans b a includes million and million  respectively  of real estate owned by underlying trusts 
see also the table below regarding property type concentrations for further information on real estate owned by underlying trusts 
b as of february   total specially serviced loans were approximately billion  or of the total mortgage loans 
the specially serviced mortgage loans as of december  were secured by properties of the types and located in the states identified below property type in millions percentage geographic location in millions percentage hotel florida retail texas multifamily oregon healthcare california office massachusetts industrial pennsylvania other other total  total  approximately million of these loans in special servicing are real estate owned by underlying trusts 
full service hotels represent of the total hotel loans in special servicing and limited service hotels represent of the total hotel loans in special servicing 
approximately million of these loans in special servicing are real estate owned by underlying trusts 
the following table provides a summary of the change in the balance of specially serviced loans from december  to december  in millions specially serviced loans  december  transfers in due to monetary default transfers in due to covenant default and other transfers out of special servicing loan amortization specially serviced loans  december   represents the reduction of the scheduled principal balances due to borrower payments or  in the case of loans in monetary default  advances made by the master servicers 
the most significant borrowing relationship in our specially serviced mortgage loan portfolio consists of loans with scheduled principal balances as of december  totaling approximately million spread across three cmbs transactions secured by hotel properties in the western and pacific northwestern states 
as of december   our total exposure  including advances and interest on advances of approximately million  on these loans was approximately million 
such total exposure is prior to the application of payments made to date by the borrower under the terms of our consensual settlement agreement and is expected to be reduced by the application of such payments at the settlement agreement closing 
the borrower initially filed for bankruptcy protection in february and indicated that the properties had experienced reduced operating performance due to new competition  the economic recession  and reduced travel resulting from the september  terrorist attacks 
we entered into a consensual settlement agreement dated february  pursuant to which the loan terms were amended and modified 
this agreement was subsequently approved and confirmed by the bankruptcy court on march  the parties are currently proceeding toward closing a comprehensive modification of each loan  which is expected to occur in march and which is expected to return the loans to performing status 
the closing of the loan modification is a complex process involving a large number of parties  all of whom must ultimately agree on  among other things  a reconciliation of payments and funds applied since the loan modification was approved by the bankruptcy court 
the borrower continues to make payments under the modified terms 
as of december   the borrower has made principal and interest payments totaling approximately million  the majority of which represents interest paid as compared to principal amortization on the modified loan balances 
during the year ended december   the borrower also sold one of the properties that secured these loans 
in addition  as of december   the borrower has remitted approximately million in funds from debtor in possession accounts  which is expected to be applied to arrearages at closing 
cash received from our subordinated cmbs could be significantly reduced if we are not successful in resolving these loans favorably and returning them to performing status 
if the modifications are not successfully closed  the loans would remain in default 
there can be no assurance that the borrower would continue making the loan payments required under the loan modifications or that the trust master servicers would continue to advance loan payments on behalf of the borrower 
further  as previously mentioned  as a result of the borrower s initial default  the trust master servicers have advanced substantial amounts of principal and interest payments to the related trusts 
we do not believe that the governing trust agreements are clear as to the manner in which such master servicer advances are to be reimbursed  and are attempting to negotiate an arrangement with the master servicers and other parties to the trust which would provide for reimbursement of master servicer advances that would be in the best interest of all of the respective certificateholders 
to the extent that we cannot successfully complete those arrangements  we and the other trust parties could dispute the proper reimbursement mechanics  and  as a result  the timing and or amount of payments made to us on our subordinated cmbs  and the related fair value of the subordinated cmbs  could be adversely affected 
finally  even if both the loan modifications and master servicer advance reimbursement arrangements are successfully completed  distributions on our subordinated cmbs  and the related fair value of the subordinated cmbs  will continue to be dependent on the borrower s continued performance under the terms of the modified loans 
advance limitations  appraisal reductions and losses on cmbs we experience shortfalls in expected cash flow on our cmbs prior to the recognition of a realized loss primarily due to servicing advance limitations resulting from appraisal reductions 
an appraisal reduction event can result in reduced master servicer principal and interest advances based on the amount by which the sum of the unpaid principal balance of the loan  accumulated principal and interest advances and other expenses exceeds in most cases of the newly appraised value of the property underlying the mortgage loan 
as the holder of the lowest rated and first loss bonds  our bonds are the first to experience interest shortfalls as a result of the reduced advancing requirement 
in general  the master servicer can advance up to a maximum of the difference between of the property s appraised value and the sum of accumulated principal and interest advances and expenses 
as an example  assuming a weighted average coupon of on a first loss subordinated cmbs  a million appraisal reduction would reduce our net cash flows by up to  on an annual basis  assuming that the total exposure was equal to or greater than of the appraised value immediately prior to receipt of the new appraisal appraisal reduction 
the ultimate disposition or work out of the mortgage loan may result in a higher or lower realized loss on our subordinated cmbs than the calculated appraisal reduction amount 
cumulative appraisal reductions through december  for the cmbs transactions in which we retain an ownership interest as reported by the underlying trustees or as estimated by us were as follows in thousands cbo  cbo  nomura  total  certain securities from the cbo  cbo and nomura transactions are expected to experience principal write downs over their expected lives 
the following tables summarize the actual realized losses on our cmbs through december  including realized mortgage loan losses expected to pass through to our cmbs during the next month and the expected future real estate losses underlying our cmbs in thousands cbo cbo nomura total year actual realized losses year actual realized losses    year actual realized losses   year actual realized losses    year actual realized losses     cumulative actual realized losses through december   cumulative actual realized losses through the year expected loss estimates for the year    expected loss estimates for the year    expected loss estimates for the year    expected loss estimates for the year    expected loss estimates for the year    expected loss estimates for the remaining life of cmbs   cumulative expected loss estimates including cumulative actual realized losses through life of cmbs     we revised our overall expected loss estimate related to our subordinated cmbs to million at december   with such total losses occurring or expected to occur through the life of the subordinated cmbs portfolio 
this revision to the overall expected loss estimate is primarily the result of increased projected losses due to lower internal estimates of values on properties underlying certain mortgage loans and real estate owned by underlying trusts  and  in some cases  changes in the timing of resolution and disposition of certain specially serviced assets  which when combined  has resulted in higher projected loss severities on loans and real estate owned by underlying trusts currently or anticipated to be in special servicing 
the primary reasons for lower estimates of value include the poor performance of certain properties and related markets and changes to workout negotiations due  in large part  to the softness in the economy and the lag typically associated with real estate fundamentals  the continued slowdown in travel and  in some cases  over supply of hotel properties  and a shift in retail activity in some markets 
there can be no assurance that our revised overall expected loss estimate of million will not be exceeded as a result of additional or adverse events or circumstances 
see further discussion of changes to the overall expected loss estimate and impairment charges in the discussions above regarding impairment on subordinated cmbs 
summary of other assets portfolio investment as of december  and  our other assets consisted primarily of insured mortgage securities  equity investments  mezzanine loans  other mbs  cash and cash equivalents as previously discussed  principal and interest receivables and real estate owned 
we had million and million at fair value invested in insured mortgage securities as of december  and  respectively 
the reduction in total fair value is primarily attributable to the prepayment or sale of approximately based on amortized cost of the insured mortgages during the year ended december  as of december   of our remaining investment in insured mortgage securities were gnma mortgage backed securities and were fha insured mortgage loans 
as of december  and  we had approximately million and million  respectively  in investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
included in equity investments are a the general partnership interests to ownership interests in the aim limited partnerships  and b a limited partnership interest in the advisor to the aim limited partnerships 
the decrease in these investments is primarily due to significant underlying loan payoffs and normal cash flow distributions 
the carrying values of our equity investments are expected to continue to decline over time as the aim limited partnerships asset bases decrease and proceeds are distributed to partners 
three of the aim limited partnerships aim  aim and aim were liquidated in february during the year ended december   one mezzanine loan prepaid 
this prepayment resulted in a decrease in other assets of approximately million 
as of december  and  we had approximately million and million in mezzanine loans  respectively 
our other mbs primarily include investment grade cmbs  investment grade residential mortgage backed securities  agency debt securities and other fixed income securities 
as of december  and  the fair values of our other mbs were approximately million and million  respectively 
we own a shopping center in orlando  florida which we account for as real estate owned 
as of december  and  we had million and million  respectively  in real estate owned assets included in other assets million and million  respectively  relating to the actual building and land 
in addition  we had million and million of mortgage payable net of discount related to the real estate as of december  and  respectively 
we have been working to reposition and stabilize this asset to increase its value  although we are also considering other alternatives 
mortgage servicing as of december  and  cmslp s other assets consisted primarily of advances receivable  investments in interest only strips  investments in cmbs  fixed assets  and investments in sub advisory contracts 
the servicing other assets have decreased by approximately million from million at december  to million at december  the decrease is primarily the result of the sale of investment grade cmbs in january in connection with our recapitalization 
in october  we received approximately million in advances receivable reimbursement related to one loan  which resulted in a corresponding decrease in advances receivable 
summary of liabilities portfolio investment as of december  and  our liabilities consisted primarily of debt  accrued interest and accrued payables 
total recourse debt decreased by approximately million to million as of december  from million as of december  primarily due to the repayment of the exit debt during the first quarter of principally through the incurrence of the bear stearns debt and bref debt  partially offset by the million of borrowing under the bear stearns million secured borrowing facility to repay the fannie mae funding note 
total non recourse debt decreased by approximately million to million as of december  from million as of december  this decrease is primarily attributable to significant prepayments of mortgages underlying the insured mortgage securities during  which resulted in a corresponding reduction in the principal balances of the securitized mortgage obligations  and the repayment of the fannie mae funding note in december our payables and accrued liabilities decreased by approximately million to million as of december  from million as of december  primarily due to the january recapitalization and the payment of preferred stock dividends totaling million that were previously deferred 
additionally  during the three months ended march   we reversed approximately million of extension fees that were accrued at december  on the exit debt since they were no longer payable 
in addition  we paid million of interest that was accrued  as of december   on the series b senior secured notes 
mortgage servicing as of december  and  cmslp s liabilities consisted primarily of operating accounts payable and accrued expenses 
the servicing liabilities increased by approximately million to million as of december  from  as of december  primarily due to the accrual of executive contract termination costs  severance costs and other normal operating expenses 
dividends other no cash dividends were paid to common shareholders during the year due to our net operating losses for tax purposes 
based on current taxable income estimates  it is expected that preferred or common dividends  if any  paid in and thereafter will be taxable to the shareholders since we are not expecting to generate net operating losses 
however  we are expecting to use our accumulated net operating losses beginning in dividends paid in   and were considered return of capital for tax 
as of december   there were no unpaid preferred dividends 
on march   the board of directors declared cash dividends of  and per share of series b  series f and series g preferred stock  respectively  payable on march  to shareholders of record on march  factors which could impact dividends  if any  include i the level of income earned on mortgage assets  such as subordinated cmbs including  but not limited to  the amount of original issue discount income  interest shortfalls and realized losses on subordinated cmbs  ii net operating losses  iii the fluctuating yields on short term  variable rate debt and the rate at which our libor based debt is priced  as well as the rate we pay on our other borrowings and fluctuations in long term interest rates  iv changes in operating expenses  including hedge costs  v margin calls  vi the level of income earned on our insured mortgage securities depending primarily on prepayments  vii the rate at which cash flows from mortgage assets  mortgage dispositions  and  to the extent applicable  distributions from our subsidiaries can be reinvested  viii cash dividends paid on preferred shares  ix to the extent applicable  whether our taxable mortgage pools continue to be exempt from corporate level taxes  x realized losses on certain transactions  and xi the timing and amounts of cash flows attributable to our other lines of business mortgage servicing 
cash dividends on our common stock are subject to the prior payment of all accrued and unpaid dividends on our preferred stock  and cash dividends on our junior classes of preferred stock are subject to the prior payment of all accrued and unpaid dividends on our senior preferred stock 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
we continually evaluate the estimates we use to prepare the consolidated financial statements  and update those estimates as necessary 
in general  management s estimates are based on historical experience  on information from third parties  and other various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made  and changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been selected could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
our critical accounting estimates include the determination of fair value of our subordinated cmbs and interest income recognition related to our cmbs 
fair value of subordinated cmbs due to the limited liquidity of the subordinated cmbs market and the resulting lack of a secondary market  the values of our subordinated cmbs are based on available market and certain third party information and management s estimates 
these estimates require significant judgment regarding assumptions for defaults on the underlying commercial mortgage loan collateral  timing of loss realization and resultant loss severity  timing and amount of principal losses and interest shortfalls  timing and amount of potential recoveries of such shortfalls and discount rates 
notes and to notes to consolidated financial statements contain a detailed discussion of the methodology used to determine the fair value of our subordinated cmbs as well as a sensitivity analysis related to the fair value of these subordinated cmbs due to changes in assumptions related to losses on the underlying commercial mortgage loan collateral and discount rates 
interest income recognition related to subordinated cmbs interest income recognition under eitf no 
requires us to make estimates based on certain assumptions including expected losses on the underlying commercial mortgage loan collateral which directly impact the cash flows on our subordinated cmbs in the form of interest shortfalls and loss of principal and the impact these factors would have on future cash flow 
note to notes to consolidated financial statements details the expected realized losses by year that we expect to incur related to our subordinated cmbs 
the cash flows we project to arrive at the effective interest rate to recognize interest income are adjusted for these expected losses 
the judgment regarding future expected credit losses is subjective as credit performance is particular to an individual deal s specific underlying commercial mortgage loan collateral 
in general  if we increase our expected losses or determine such losses will occur sooner than previously projected and the cmbs s fair value is below cost  then the cmbs will be considered impaired and adjusted to fair value with the impairment charge recorded through earnings 
recent accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation or fin no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements 
fin no 
explains how to identify variable interest entities and how an enterprise assesses its interests in a variable interest entity to decide whether to consolidate that entity 
this interpretation requires existing unconsolidated variable interest entities to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries if the entities do not effectively disperse risks among parties involved 
fin no 
is effective immediately for variable interest entities created after january   and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date 
according to fin no 
r issued in december  the interpretation applies at the end of the first reporting period ending after march   to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before february  we do not expect the adoption of fin no 
to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our principal market risk is exposure to changes in interest rates related to the us treasury market as well as the libor market 
we will have fluctuations in the amount of interest expense paid on our variable rate debt primarily due to changes in one month libor 
we will also experience fluctuations in the market value of our mortgage assets related to changes in the yields of us treasury securities as well as changes in the spread between us treasury securities and the mortgage assets and overall required returns 
the combination of the risk free rate us treasury yields and the related spread is the discount rate used to determine the fair value of our mortgage assets 
as of december   the average us treasury rate used to price our cmbs  excluding the b through unrated issuer s equity cmbs  had increased by basis points  compared to december  as of december   credit spreads used to price our investment grade cmbs tightened and credit spreads used to price our subordinated cmbs which are not expected to experience losses widened  compared to december  the fair values of our ccc and d cmbs in cbo and our unrated issuer s equity are determined using a loss adjusted yield to maturity  which  in our view  is commensurate with the market s perception of value and risk of comparable assets 
as described above  interest rates and spreads  which are reflective of the credit fundamentals of the underlying commercial real estate assets  impact the fair values of our cmbs 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our margin maintenance requirements under the bear stearns debt 
cmbs the required rate of return used to determine the fair values of our cmbs is comprised of many variables  such as a risk free rate  a liquidity premium and a credit risk premium 
these variables are combined to determine a total rate that  when used to discount the cmbs s assumed stream of future cash flows  results  in our view  in the fair value of such cash flows 
the determination of such rate is dependent on many quantitative and qualitative factors  such as  but not limited to  the market s perception of the issuers of the cmbs and the credit fundamentals of the commercial properties underlying each underlying pool of commercial mortgage loans 
if we assumed that the discount rate used to determine the fair values of our cmbs a through unrated bonds increased by basis points and basis points  the increase in the discount rate would have resulted in a corresponding decrease in the fair values of our cmbs a through unrated bonds by approximately million or and approximately million or  respectively  as of december  a basis point and basis point increase in the discount rate would have resulted in a corresponding decrease in the value of our subordinated cmbs bb through unrated bonds by approximately million or and million or  respectively  as of december  see also note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of other factors that could affect the fair values of our cmbs  including changes in the timing and or amount of credit losses on underlying mortgage loans  master servicer advances  the receipt of mortgage payments earlier than projected due to prepayments  and delays in the receipt of monthly cash flow distributions on cmbs due to mortgage loan defaults and or extensions in loan maturities 
interest rate swap during  we entered into three interest rate swaps to hedge the variability of the future interest payments on the anticipated cdo transaction attributable to changes in interest rates 
our obligations to bear stearns under the interest rate swap documents are collateralized by certain assets as described in note to notes to consolidated financial statements 
through december   these swaps were treated as cash flow hedges for gaap 
under these swaps  we have agreed to pay bear stearns a weighted average interest fixed rate of per annum in exchange for floating payments based on one month libor on the total notional amount of million 
these swaps were effective on october  the swaps are intended to protect our cost of financing in connection with our anticipated cdo 
we intend to terminate the swaps simultaneously with the issuance of the cdo or other refinancing transaction 
as of december   the aggregate fair value of the interest rate swaps was an asset of approximately million 
a basis point increase decrease in the year swap rates would result in an approximate million increase decrease in the fair value of our interest rate swaps  with an aggregate notional amount of million 
variable rate debt we maintain an interest rate cap to mitigate the adverse effects of rising interest rates on the amount of interest expense payable under our variable rate debt 
on october   we purchased an interest rate cap for  with a notional amount of million  an effective date of november   maturity on november   and capping one month libor at 
our cap provides protection to the extent interest rates  based on a readily determinable interest rate index typically one month libor  increase above the stated interest rate cap  in which case  we would receive payments based on the difference between the index and the cap 
the term of the cap as well as the stated interest rate of the cap  which is currently above the current rate of the index  would limit the amount of protection that the cap offers 
the one month libor rate was at december  a basis point increase in the one month libor index would have increased our interest expense on our bear stearns debt by approximately million during the year ended december  insured mortgage securities there would not be a material change in the fair values of our insured mortgage securities if we assumed that the discount rate used to determine the fair values increased by basis points and basis points as of december  since the underlying mortgages are generally prepayable and have an assumed weighted average life of less than one year
