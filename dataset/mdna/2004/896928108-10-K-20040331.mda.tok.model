overview tripos provides products and services to the pharmaceutical  biotechnology  and life science industries to support early stage research activities 
sales to the pharmaceutical industry represent of tripos total revenue 
tripos offerings are applied principally to assist research chemists to make decisions about the most productive new compounds to make and test as potential therapeutics 
through its own chemistry laboratories  tripos can also make those compounds for its clients 
through strategic partnerships  tripos can also test compounds for its clients 
the industries that tripos serves are highly research driven 
the mature pharmaceutical companies typically spend between and of their annual revenues on research in the search for new blockbuster drugs 
this research process consists of several phases from early discovery of compounds of interest  through testing of the promising ones for activity and safety in animals  to final testing of these compounds in humans 
the investment in the research activity increases dramatically in the second and third phases of the research activity 
tripos offerings are most relevant to the initial phase of this activity 
our products and services are designed and intended to provide our pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers with improved ways to identify and select the most promising drug candidates to take forward into the more expensive and time consuming stages of the drug development process 
depending on the number of compounds that a particular company has in different stages of their new therapeutic pipeline  they may reduce or increase investment in the other phases of research 
further  decisions by the pharmaceutical industry concerning their research investments are strongly influenced by decisions by the various governments of the world about drug pricing and regulation 
tripos software products are sold on a renewable license basis  typically with term of one or three years 
this business is generally predictable  with high renewal rates for licenses 
tripos management closely monitors license expirations and deploys sales staff to ensure the highest probability of renewals 
tripos service businesses  both informatics and chemistry  are much less predictable 
the sales cycles for these offerings are typically long from six months to eighteen months and are highly influenced by factors in the macro economic environment including the general state of the pharmaceutical industry and the political situations in various parts of the world 
to forecast potential business in these areas  tripos management strives to closely interact with the management of its customers and is closely involved in business development activities for service projects 
large service contracts for pharmaceutical research  both informatics and chemistry  are complex and  because they are deployed in research applications where outcomes are uncertain  have a large risk component 
risk management in these projects begins with the definition of project requirements and continues through performance metrics and customer acceptance milestones 
due to the complexity of the projects and changing priorities within client organizations  it is typical that many decision points will arise that require management attention both at tripos and at the client 
to mitigate the project difficulties  tripos has developed a process focus and management monitors milestones in the project plan according to the process workflow 
despite best efforts  however  some projects are of sufficient complexity that they present challenges that require revisions to the project plan and scope 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued having been a public company spinout in with limited capital  and limited additional capital raised over the past decade  the company has focused on profitability and cashflow 
that said  the company has not always been profitable  but has achieved it in certain years 
major investments  say in the recent expansion of our chemistry research laboratories in england  have been funded by successful investments ie arena pharmaceuticals  cash from operations  temporary use of debt capacity  and grant funding from the british government 
we generate revenues from a diversified offering of products and services 
we derived of our and of our revenues from discovery software products and support  of and of revenues from discovery informatics services  of and of revenues from discovery research products and services 
the remainder is from hardware sales 
we license our discovery software products and post contract support pcs as either perpetual licenses or time based licenses  typically one to three year renewable contracts 
the magnitude of these license fees is dependent on each customer s required usage levels  that is  the number of locations and individual users 
variations in licensing levels range from the low hundred thousands up to several million dollars 
the following are descriptions of our current sales models for discovery software perpetual licenses software pricing is taken from our price list based on the quantity of individual modules and number of users 
it is billed upon delivery 
revenue for software is recognized upon delivery of product and issuance of perpetual keys 
support pricing is a fixed percentage of the total current list price of the software purchased and is billed annually 
the company has analyzed the other elements included in its multiple element arrangements involving perpetual licenses  and determined it has sufficient vendor specific objective evidence vsoe to allocate revenues to pcs and or training 
vsoe for pcs and training is established based on upon the price charged when those elements are sold separately 
for pcs this is established based on the renewal rate specified in the arrangement  which is consistently priced at a percentage of the list price of the purchased licenses 
training is charged consistently from the company s price list 
token licenses in  the company began offering time based token licenses as an alternative to perpetual licenses 
this allows our customers to obtain multiple software products bundled with pcs that is co terminus with the period of the arrangement typically years 
a token license includes specific software modules and specified numbers of users of each module with all product and access keys delivered on or before the effective date of the contract 
tripos software is sold to professional users on an off the shelf basis in which the customer is responsible for installation 
these non cancelable  non refundable contracts are normally three years in duration over the past three years  of token sales were for a period of three years or less  although certain customers request shorter or longer contract periods 
at the end of the contract term  the customer must renew the license or the software will cease to operate 
pcs  which includes unspecified updates  upgrades and help desk services  is included in the total price of the contract 
the pcs provided under token arrangements is the same as that provided to customers under perpetual agreements 
token contract pricing is taken from our established price list for products includes package pricing and a la cart pricing  number of users and length of term 
all contracted products are delivered at inception 
if the customer should want additional modules  users or new software products upon their release  the customer must enter a new contract or addendum and pay the incremental fees to purchase these items 
software revenue and pcs revenues under token license agreements are recognized ratably by month 
term licenses term licenses represent one year arrangements for a software product and one year of pcs 
the price is taken from the company s price list by product 
the support renewal fee is a fixed percentage of the software price similar to perpetual model 
the pcs provided for under term arrangements is the same as that provided to customers under perpetual agreements 
software and support pricing are separately stated and billed upon delivery of product 
to continue to operate the software  the customer must pay their annual renewal fee 
software revenue and pcs revenues under term license agreements are recognized ratably by month 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued our integration of chemistry and biological data in the life sciences industries creates a revenue stream for enterprise software consulting 
to serve this market  we maintain a staff of specialists who use our proprietary data integration framework  such as metalayer  lithium  formsbuilder  tripos electronic notebook technologies  registration inventory ordering  and auspyx tm to configure customized solutions for data management 
revenue may be generated on a billable rate per day  or upon achievement of milestones or deliverables and is recognized as production activities are performed 
these contracts may also generate substantial license fee revenue for our proprietary software technologies 
as with our discovery software products  licensing levels may range from the low hundred thousands up to several million dollars 
we develop and manufacture general screening compound libraries for sale to the life sciences industry for a fee per compound delivered 
this has created the opportunity to offer follow up discovery research methods to customers for design and synthesis of focused libraries for lead optimization 
we also market a comprehensive research process to our life sciences customers for rapid and cost effective discovery 
this process combines advanced informatics  chemistry and biology products and services  and proprietary discovery technologies for efficient lead development  refinement  and optimization resulting in a tightly integrated process to facilitate synergies in drug discovery 
we also act as a reseller of computer hardware 
hardware sales are generally made to facilitate our software customers access to hardware components and are not a primary focus of our sales activities 
we act as an authorized reseller and order inventory on an as needed basis  and thus do not maintain any inventory 
accordingly  margins on these sales are relatively modest 
we license discovery software tools to customers  provide ongoing support including upgrades selected by customers and provide informatics services to customers that enable integration of our existing and newly developed discovery tools to customers discovery operations 
we generally expense research and development costs associated with software enhancements and new functionality 
thus  a significant portion of the costs associated with development and enhancement of software is accounted for as research and development and not as a cost of software sales 
certain software development projects require substantial commitments of time and resources 
costs of these projects are capitalized upon achievement of technological feasibility and or a working model according to statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
quarterly expenses include the fixed costs of research and development for software development and new chemistry research 
we believe that core selling and administrative costs will remain generally consistent as a percent of sales on an annual basis 
variability in quarterly expenses primarily occurs in relation to the level of revenues due to sales compensation  bonuses and staffing for selling  general and administrative functions and for periodic marketing activities such as appearances at trade exhibitions 
during and  we applied our capital resources to fund investments in the building of chemistry production facilities  chemical compound library inventories  collaborative drug discovery programs  staffing new business opportunities  and investments in arena pharmaceuticals 
in fiscal year  we used cash available from an equity investment by lion to maintain capital infrastructure  reduce debt levels and conduct operations 
in and  we invested in a major expansion of our chemistry laboratory facilities in order to capture additional business opportunities  funded by our successful investment in arena pharmaceuticals  grants from the british government  capital leases and related forms of debt  and cash from operations 
our revenues and expenses vary from quarter to quarter depending upon  among other things  the timing of customers budget processes  the success of our sales efforts  the lengthy sales cycle and our ability to influence customers and prospective customers to make decisions to outsource portions of their discovery process  the size of the customers capital expenditure budgets  the ability to produce compound libraries in a timely manner  market acceptance of new products and enhanced versions of existing products  the timing of new product introductions by us and other vendors  changes in pricing policies ours  partners and other vendors  consolidation in customer base  client involvement in decision points in contracts related to project plans  our ability to accurately match contract costs to milestone or contract performance requirements on our larger collaborative arrangements  and changes in general economic and competitive conditions 
see note of the notes to consolidated financ ial statements for a discussion of revenue recognition policies 
because much of our software license and pcs revenue along with our contracted discovery research revenue is recognized ratably over multiple periods  fluctuations in our quarterly revenues and earnings are caused principally by sales of compounds or by achievement of milestones on specific projects 
our management team monitors quarterly business activity with the aid of sales pipeline reports and monthly financial reports 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued critical accounting policies the following information is provided in order to illustrate which accounting policies management deems to be the most critical in the computation of the financial statements included later in this form k 
revenue recognition 
the following are the revenue recognition policies for each of our offerings discovery software products the company recognizes revenues in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended 
revenues from software license agreements are recognized when each of the following criteria are met as set forth in paragraph of sop persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is probable 
the company allocates revenues on perpetual software arrangements involving multiple elements to each element based on the relative fair values of each element 
the company s determination of fair value of each element in multiple element arrangements is based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe 
the company limits its assessment of vsoe for each element to the price charged when the same element is sold separately by the company 
the company has analyzed all of the elements included in its multiple element arrangements and determined that it has sufficient vsoe to allocate revenues to maintenance and support services  and training 
the company sells training separately and has established vsoe on this basis 
vsoe for maintenance and support is determined based upon the renewal rates in contracts themselves  which is based on a fixed percentage of the current perpetual license list price 
accordingly  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met  revenues from perpetual licenses are recognized upon delivery of the software using the residual method in accordance with sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
software maintenance agreements provide technical support and the right to unspecified enhancements and upgrades on a when and if available basis 
post contract customer support revenues on perpetual agreements are recognized ratably over the term of the support period generally one year  and training and other service revenues are recognized as the related services are provided 
any unrecognized portion of amounts paid or billed in advance for licenses and services is recorded as deferred revenue 
term and token licenses represent time based license arrangements for one or multiple software products that are sold with maintenance and support for the term of the license arrangement 
the company recognizes revenues from these bundled time based licenses ratably over the license term  which is typically to years 
discovery informatics services discovery informatics services dis represents contracts for the development and delivery of enterprise wide customized software such as laboratory information systems or database integration projects 
technological feasibility exists on these software arrangements and they typically include installation at the customer s site 
we account for these arrangements in accordance with sop  as required by sop since the contract to deliver software and installation requires significant production  modification or customization of software 
in applying the provisions of sop the percentage of completion is utilized 
for contracts where customer approval of contractually required tasks must occur at each distinct milestone  and where amounts billable are indicative of progress to completion  we record revenues when a milestone has been met and accepted by the customer 
for contracts without distinct milestones  we measure progress using the cost to cost method  which approximates progress towards completion 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued critical accounting policies continued dis also includes software development sd projects that are contractual arrangements with customers for use of tripos software developers in an effort to develop a scientific software tool for use in drug discovery 
the contractual arrangements are on a commercially reasonable basis  and the customer is subject to billings on a time and materials basis 
accordingly  we record the related revenue when the time and costs are incurred at the stated contractual rates 
discovery research products and services discovery research sales include sales of chemical compounds from inventory  long term contracts to design and produce chemical compounds to customer specifications  or contracts to perform discovery research activities 
tripos recognizes revenue from the sale of chemical compounds upon shipment of the products  fob shipping point  to the customer 
this practice is consistent with the four criteria required for revenue recognition listed in paragraph of sab for chemical compound transactions  persuasive evidence of an agreement exists upon the receipt of a contract outlining the purchase and usage terms of the compounds 
a purchase order may also be received as confirmation 
as stated above  revenue is not recognized until the compounds have been shipped to the customer 
the selling price for compounds is fixed according to the terms of the contract or customer s purchase order 
payment terms for chemical compound transactions are net days 
the company has experienced very few bad debts arising from these product transactions  as a result  collectibility is reasonably assured 
in accordance with sop  sales derived from long term contracts to design and produce chemical compounds to customer specifications are recorded using the percentage of completion method as the compounds are delivered under the units of delivery method 
the contract costs related to delivered compounds are recorded to cost of sales as the compounds are delivered and revenue is recognized 
discovery research activities involve lead compound optimization projects  custom synthesis  and compound design 
these contracts are generally call for non refundable contractual fees tied to time and materials 
accordingly  revenues under contracts of this type are recorded on a time and material basis 
when contracts to perform discovery research activities require a specific deliverable  the direct and incremental contract costs are deferred 
revenue and the contract costs are then recorded upon delivery and acceptance 
hardware sales hardware sales are recorded upon delivery unless delivered in connection with a contractual arrangement involving term or token software licenses 
when hardware is sold in conjunction with a term or token license  the entire contractual revenue amount is recognized ratably over the term or token software license period and the related hardware costs are deferred and recorded in cost of sales ratably over the same period 
valuation of accounts receivable 
due to the nature and credit quality of our customer base principally major pharmaceutical companies  universities and larger biotechnology companies  provision for bad debts is typically calculated on a case by case basis and takes into consideration the age of the outstanding receivable amount by customer  the customer s cash position  and the geographic location of the customer 
historically  we have a very low experience rate of uncollectible amounts 
therefore  management believes that alternative methods for calculating allowances for bad debts such as percentage of net sales or percentage of past due receivables do not reflect our lower experience rates and thus that the specific identification method is more appropriate 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued critical accounting policies continued valuation of investments in securities 
marketable securities consist of investments in equity securities of unconsolidated affiliates and are held as available for sale 
we account for securities that can be sold within the next months as marketable securities 
amounts presented are the fair values of the investments on the balance sheet date determined using then current market quotes 
unrealized gains and losses are recorded as increases or decreases in the assets value and are reflected in other comprehensive income until the assets are sold 
at december   this category on our balance sheet reflected the market value of our holdings in arena pharmaceuticals  inc as of december   marketable securities also included specific foreign exchange hedge instruments at their market value 
the carrying values of all of the investments are reviewed on a quarterly basis and adjustments  due to fluctuations in market pricing and or i mpairment  are made to reflect the then current net realizable value 
capitalization and valuation of chemical compound costs 
initial costs to develop our leadquest compounds chemical compounds for sale for use in drug discovery are categorized as research and development expense until such time it becomes probable that a salable library can be successfully produced 
therefore  costs for design  research  and analytical procedures for every library of compounds are expensed as incurred 
our research chemists review the results of analytical procedures to determine if the chemical reactions completed as expected and the product purity and product yields are within acceptable tolerances 
this validation process determines whether the chemistry is successful and if a saleable product will result 
we capitalize costs to inventory once the validation process is completed and successful production is reasonably assured 
if the core reaction is unsuccessful  the library template is abandoned and no further develo pment takes place 
inventory amounts shown in the consolidated balance sheet are net of an obsolescence reserve 
in calculating the reserve  the age and sales trends of each category in the inventory are taken into account to determine the net realizable value 
any shortfall between the carrying cost of the inventory and the net realizable value is provided for in the reserve 
property  plant and equipment 
all assets reflected under this category on our balance sheet are held for use in the operations of tripos 
due to the fast paced development of new technologies in computer hardware and laboratory equipment  we closely monitor the original life expectancies of new purchases and set our depreciation or amortization rates accordingly to best match the economic useful life of the asset 
assets or equipment that are no longer of use to the organization are written down to their realizable value and then disposed 
derivatives 
tripos at times uses interest rate swap agreements to create a fixed interest rate for portions of our long term floating rate debt 
additionally  we may enter foreign currency exchange instruments to protect our operating margins when performing on contracts denominated in currencies other than those in use by our selling office 
our internal policies do not allow for speculative trading in derivatives 
use of derivatives is only allowed for hedging or rate protection purposes 
derivative contracts are only allowed with high quality credit worthy financial institutions to further minimize counter party risk 
income taxes 
tripos computes income taxes using the liability method 
the primary difference between financial statement income and taxable income results from the use of different methods of computing depreciation  capitalized development costs  and other timing differences 
the effective tax rate differs from the statutory tax rate primarily due to the impact of research and development credits  which are subject to interpretation of us federal tax regulations  and the change in valuation allowance related to net operating loss carry forwards 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the following information has been amended to reflect the restatements made to the consolidated financial statements as further discussed in note restatement 
this information should be read in conjunction with the information contained in the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain consolidated financial data as a percentage of net sales  except costs of sales data  which is set forth as a percentage of the corresponding net sales data restated restated net sales discovery software products support discovery informatics services discovery research products services hardware total net sales cost of sales discovery software products support discovery informatics services discovery research products services hardware total cost of sales gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative total operating expenses income loss from operations interest income interest expense other income expense  net net income loss before income taxes income tax expense benefit net income loss preferred dividends net income loss allocable to common shareholders as a percentage of the corresponding sales net sales 
total net sales increased to million in from million in  which was up over the million recorded in these increases were the result of higher revenues in discovery software products and support in and in along with the ramp up in the four year discovery research contract with pfizer  inc to design and synthesize chemical compounds in and in 
under the pfizer compound design and synthesis contract file enrichment  we have the potential to realize up to million of revenue over the planned four year period 
in the first two years of the contract to date  we have recognized million 
therefore  we have the potential to recognize up to million over the next two years  with being less than at the same time  our discovery informatics service revenues were declining in and in due to the lack of significant new cont racts and delays in achieving milestones on existing contracts  including our contract with schering ag 
discovery informatics service is discussed in more detail below 
we generate a substantial portion of our revenues from the pharmaceutical industry 
net sales to this industry accounted for approximately  and  of total net sales in   and  respectively 
net sales from our activities outside of north america represented approximately  and of total net sales in  and  respectively  with europe accounting for  and  and the respective balances coming from customers in the pacific rim 
we believe that revenues from foreign activities will continue to account for a significant percentage of our total net sales 
software license sales in japan for could be adversely impacted by an injunction issued by a japanese court that prevents tripos local distributor from selling a certain third party software product within a tripos offering 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued list prices for our software products have had only modest price increases and have therefore remained relatively stable over the last few years 
due to the competitive nature of the software market in which we sell  pricing of our products will remain under pressure for the foreseeable future 
increasing net sales from period to period is dependent  in part  on our ability to introduce new products and services  which are accepted by the market  and on our ability to penetrate new and existing markets 
sales to existing customers have represented over of total net sales over the last three years 
total discovery software product and support sales increased to million from million in which was up from s million 
in february  we announced that we would recognize revenues from term and token software licenses ratably over the course of the license terms and accordingly restated our financial statements for fiscal years under this revised revenue recognition  the majority of our software licenses are time based from which the corresponding revenue is recognized on a ratable basis over the length of each license term typically to years 
the revenue from time based software arrangements in was over million 
in  time based software license revenues including our global wide area network contract with pfizer were over million 
by comparison  s time based software license revenues were just over million 
revenue recognition from time based software license arrangements will normally stretch into subsequent periods depending on the length of individual contract terms 
as an illustration  the software revenue deferred from non cancelable contracts initiated in recent fiscal years that will be recognized in is projected to be over million 
the table presented in note time based software license arrangements presents the total amounts of deferred revenues from non cancelable time based software license arrangements 
our discovery informatics service activities were significantly impacted by the overall slow down in spending by the pharmaceutical industry that started in mid and continued into late we noticed that fewer custom informatics projects were being initiated by major pharmaceutical firms over this period 
during the late stages of  the industry started to show signs of recovery in its outsource spending activity in terms of new projects being put out for bid 
discovery informatics service revenues declined by to million in from million in this decline is a result of fewer significant informatics consulting contracts in along with an adjustment in the fourth quarter of  in the revenue recognized on our contract with schering ag 
tripos achieved a significant data migration milestone under this contract  however  the two companies are in talks regarding the specifications and financial arrangements necessary to complete the development and d eployment of the production version of the agreed technology 
this would require a scope change to the existing contract 
because these discussions are not finalized  tripos recorded a charge in for the estimated project costs in excess of the revenues that it could expect under the current contract terms 
in calculating the amount of the charge to be recorded  tripos assumed that the project would not continue past delivery and rollout of the current production system in mid this assumption led to a corresponding reduction of approximately  in the total revenues available under the contract through the expected mid delivery 
tripos is required to write off these costs and make this adjustment to revenues so that its year end financial statements fairly reflect the project status and contractual terms as of december  this adjustment assumes completion of the mid deployment only 
it does not include any additional revenues that may be received as a result of the renegotia tion to cover functionality and time that were not anticipated in the original contract for full implementation of this project 
the decline of from in discovery informatics service revenue is primarily due to the lack of new contracts to replace completed ones along with the delay of a key milestone on a major contract with another customer that ultimately reduced our potential revenue from that contract 
we derive discovery research revenues from our compound library product  leadquest  and discovery research activities 
discovery research sales increased to million in from million in  which was higher than the million recognized in the primary reason for the increases was initiation of work in january on a four year million contract with pfizer  inc to design and synthesize chemical compounds 
the project plan called for a ramp up in the production and delivery of the custom compounds for pfizer 
revenue is recognized in accordance with sop  under the percentage of completion method using an output measure for revenue recognition units of delivery method 
the original contract called for a minimum two year commitment from pfizer 
upon completing the first two years of the contract in  the relationship was amended in early to reflect a reduction in compound collection production and a corresponding move into next st age hit follow up work between tripos and pfizer 
the amendment also reflects a further minimum commitment through and a revised expected year revenue total of million 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued hardware revenues grew in to just under million compared just over  in  a decrease of from million in we do not aggressively promote hardware due to its low margin  but merely provide access to product as a convenience to customers 
the high end server and workstation equipment that we traditionally have recommended to our customers continues to face growing competition from lower cost alternatives 
this change  combined with the fact that we do not actively pursue or market hardware products  is reflected in the trend of an overall decrease in sales of these products in recent years 
cost of sales 
total cost of sales increased to million in from million in  which in turn was up from million in these costs represent  and of total net sales  respectively 
costs of software products and support represented  and of software license and support sales in  and  respectively 
costs of software products and support consist of amortization of capitalized software  royalties to third party developers  commissions to pacific rim distributors  the cost of software product packaging and media  the costs related to staffing telephone support functions  packaging for updates upgrades  and updates to documentation 
staffing costs are expected to increase in future periods at or near the rates of cost of living increases 
the increases in cost as a percent to sales in and resulted from a change in the mix of internal versus third party products sold  thus resulting in higher royalty payments 
the effective rate of royalties has risen in recent years  however  it is expected to stabilize over future periods 
costs of discovery informatics services dis represented  and of discovery informatics service revenues in  and  respectively 
costs of dis are direct charges for staff  travel and overhead required to develop custom software solutions for clients 
cost of dis exceeded revenues due to the additional anticipated losses under our contract with schering ag 
as stated above in the discussion of dis revenues  tripos is involved in negotiations with schering to amend the specifications and financial arrangements necessary to complete the development and deployment of the production version of the previously agreed technology 
because these discussions are not finalized  tripos recorded a charge of approximately  for the estimated project costs in excess of the total project revenues that it could expect under the current contract terms 
in calculating the amount of the charge to be recorded  tripos was required to utilize the existing contract terms  and could not assume that the project would continue past delivery and rollout of the current production system in mid tripos is required to accrue these excess costs so that its year end financial statements fairly reflect the project status as of december  the significant increase in the cost of discovery informatics in is principally attributable to a delayed milestone and subsequent restructuring of a contract with another customer 
we expensed the anticipated costs to complete the delayed milestone in the second quarter of when it became apparent that we would incur a loss on that specific milestone 
we took a charge in the fourth quarter of to reflect the anticipated loss to complete the remainder of the contract 
as of the date of this report  tripos has successfully delivered interim versions of the software on the agreed due dates and remains on pace to complete the assignment for the anticipated loss accrued for in costs of discovery research products and services represented  and of discovery research sales in  and  respectively 
the cost of the discovery research business is represented by the raw material  direct labor and overhead costs to produce compound libraries and to deliver on contracted research projects 
discovery research contracts may also include third party costs for production of larger quantities of intermediate or scale up materials 
as a result  variability in cost of sales may be attributed to the mix of compound products and discovery research revenues 
the increases in cost of sales of discovery research activities in and are attributable to the ramp up in production for the pfizer compound design and synthesis contract 
increased costs were primarily the result of the required outsourcing to successfully deliver against the contract  combined with the financial impact of the decline of the us dollar against the great britain pound sterling where the operation is based 
see the discussion of discovery research revenues above for additional information on this contract 
in  two large compound orders had the significant effect of lowering the average cost of sales for the year 
costs of hardware represented   and of hardware sales in  and  respectively 
cost of hardware consists of the direct costs of hardware sold 
we expect the cost of hardware as a percentage of hardware sales to remain relatively stable in future periods 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued gross profit was million in  million in and million in  which represents gross profits of  and  respectively 
the decreases in gross margin are attributable to the increase in the effective rate of royalties on software products  cost overruns on two major informatics contracts and the ramp up on the pfizer compound file enrichment project 
the rate of decrease in gross profit is expected to slow in future periods but is dependent on costs of chemical materials and overhead  the mix of internal versus third party software product sales  foreign exchange rates and the company s ability to successfully deliver on informatics contracts 
sales and marketing expenses decreased to million in from million in  which was an increase of from million in sales and marketing expenses represented  and of   and total net sales  respectively 
during  we invested in our sales and marketing organization to expand our territory coverage and promotional activities to position us for future growth 
this investment plus higher commission expense resulting from increased software and discovery research business accounted for the increased costs in sales and marketing costs were less than due to lower commissions of approximately million  open senior vice president position for the entire year estimated at  along with an overall reduction in spending on selling and marketing activities 
research and development expenses increased to million in from million in  which was up from million in r d costs represented   and of net sales in  and  respectively 
the increased spending for r d reflects additional chemistry research staff at tripos receptor research and software development work that is not directly related to customer contracts or is for product development that has not yet qualified for capitalization under fas research and development expenses  including the amount of capitalized costs were million in  million in and million in in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 the company capitalizes software development costs for external use 
tripos anticipates that its investment in new product research will continue to be significant as we develop new software modules each year  work on funded software research contracts with customers  develop new technologies for use in our informatics consulting work  and pursue novel compound templates for inclusion in our leadquest libraries 
costs associated with researching novel compound templates are classified as r d up until such time as the base reaction is validated  after which costs are captured in inventory 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in which was down by from million in g a expenses represented  and of net sales for  and  respectively 
the increase in g a expense in is a primarily the result of legal fees to defend against the class action lawsuit  additions to staff  increased costs from new securities regulations and higher corporate insurance premiums 
the decrease in g a expense in was principally due to a reduction in bonus expense 
we expect general and administrative expenses to remain relatively stable as a percentage of sales in the future 
interest income was  in   in and  in reflecting a decreasing average amount of cash on hand year over year and lower interest rates 
previously  interest income included the amount of imputed interest calculated from effectively discounting the extended accounts receivable generated from multi year software license contracts 
imputed interest has been reclassified back to software license revenue under the restatement 
interest expense of  in   in and  in was from interest due on the long term note payable for the corporate building  the line of credit  and interest on capital leases 
interest expense has varied commensurate with the change in average outstanding debt balances 
the company s mortgage loan had a fixed interest rate in  and through the first four months of at a rate in excess of 
upon expiration of the fixed interest rate period  the floating rate incurred by the company averaged for the remainder of other income was million in  million in and million in other income included a million pre tax gain on the sale of just under million shares of arena pharmaceuticals 
in addition  the company benefited from a million gain on the mark to market of a series of foreign exchange hedges that fixed the rate of us dollars to british pounds 
also  due to the weakness of the us dollar  our european subsidiaries recorded currency exchange gains of approximately million

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued income tax expense benefit 
our tax expense benefit was million in  million in and million the effective tax rates were  and for  and  respectively 
the effective tax rates for  and reflect management s current estimate of the distribution of earnings among the statutory jurisdictions in which we operate and the valuation of certain tax credits and net operating losses in the us and uk for those tax years each ending december 
furthermore significant additional deferred tax assets were created related to the restatement for which an incremental valuation allowance has been established 
the establishment of the valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets does not impair our ability to use the deferred tax assets upon achieving profitability in the related jurisdictions 
upon the recognition of income in future periods in the jurisdictions where the deferred tax assets were created  release of the corresponding valuation allowances may result in a lower effective tax rate

in addition  we backed out the effect of gains on sales of shares of arena pharmaceuticals of million and the appreciation in our foreign currency forward contracts of million 
depreciation expense has grown over the past two years as a result of our capital investments in the uk which lead to another increase in as we pla ce our expanded laboratory into service and complete the acquisitions of scientific equipment 
inventory levels are expected to remain at or below current levels as we have achieved optimum production levels for our delivery commitments to pfizer

the use of funds was attributable to increases in inventories of million  increased prepaid expenses of million  net increase in deferred tax expense of million along with decreases in accounts payable and accrued expenses of million 
sources of operating cash were net collections of accounts receivable of million and increases to deferred revenue of million 
the non cash depreciation and amortization expenses of million and million  respectively are added back to net income of  inventory growth in was primarily attributable to production ramp up for the pfizer compound design and synthesis contract 
the gain on the sale of shares of arena pharmaceuticals of million was backed out of the net loss to show the effect operations on our cash position 
the growth in deferred revenue is principally attributable to the prepayments received in our discovery research contracts 
investing activities in consumed a net of million 
we spent million on our uk laboratory facility building and equipment along with million for the development of our registration  inventory and ordering software technology to be released in these expenditures were substantially funded by the million of proceeds from the sale of shares in arena pharmaceuticals 
as of december   we have  shares market value of of arena remaining 
additionally  we made investments in am pappas life science ii fund of million in  however  we took a combined write down of our investment in signase  inc and the life science ii fund of million as discussed in notes and below 
net cash used for investing activities was million in the primary investments were in fixed assets of million  principally related to the expansion of our chemistry laboratories in the uk  capitalized software development costs for laboratory research support systems of million along with a net combined investments in signase  inc and the life science ii fund of million as part of our strategic efforts to obtain access to more collaboration partners 
these investments were partially offset by the million of proceeds from the sale of  shares of arena pharmaceuticals 
financing activities yielded a net million of cash in we financed million of capital equipment and fixtures at our chemistry laboratory through capital leases 
our outstanding borrowings on bank lines of credit increased net million 
payments on capital leases were million 
we also received million from shares issued under employee stock plans 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued net cash provided by financing activities in was million 
this funding was in the form of million from the issuance of stock to participants in our stock purchase and stock option plans along with million of debt financing from our credit facilities with lasalle bank 
during  we made payments on capital leases and long term debt of million and paid a cash dividend on preferred shares of million to lion bioscience ag upon conversion of their holdings of preferred shares to common stock 
in  we will be funding the completion of our laboratory expansion project at our uk research facility 
we estimate that we will expend approximately million for capital to complete the project balance of payments on the building and remaining equipment requirements net of government grants 
additionally  over the next to months  we will be required to fund the remainder of our investment commitment million to the life science ii investment fund 
at december   tripos was in violation of its minimum shareholders equity covenant under our million line of credit and mortgage loans with lasalle bank 
in response to this violation and the changes arising from the restatement  on march  the company and lasalle bank entered into a commitment letter providing for alternative financing structures 
upon execution of an amendment to the existing facility  the modified facility  which remains at million for the revolving line of credit  would become a one year commitment with fewer covenants interest coverage and minimum shareholders equity  a clean down provision and a slight increase in associated fees 
the maturity date on the mortgage loan remains unchanged december 
the expected change in the line of credit portion of the facility better addresses the company s reduced requirement to fund capital expenditures through bank debt while meeting the expected working capital funding needs in at december   we had outstanding borrowings of million on the line of credit that were classified as short term debt 
in addition  we had million of borrowings outstanding on the temporary line of credit 
the temporary line of credit was paid in full prior to its expiration in early february along with payments of million on the regular line of credit 
completion of this alternative financing structure is subject to a number of customary contingencies  including negotiation and execution of definitive documentation 
the company expects to complete the amendment early in the second quarter of  but can provide no assurance that the amendment will be completed or that lasalle bank will not require additional terms adverse to the company 
in the event that the company is unable to amend its credit facility on appropriate terms  the company s capital resources and liquidity would be adversely affected 
we are in final stages of negotiation and documentation to obtain additional capital and operating lease financing to fund a portion of our remaining capital expenditure requirements for the laboratory 
the remainder of operating needs and capital expenditures are expected to be funded through operations 
we have made reductions in staff in early along with continued controls on spending to help achieve this goal 
activities over and above normal operations may require additional sources of funding that are not presently identified 
however  we believe that with our cash  accounts receivable balances  projected cash flows from operations  access to available borrowings from lasalle bank  if any  and incremental capital leases  we will be able to meet our liquidity needs and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the credit facilities available to us 
we expect that our capital expenditure requirements will drop substantially upon completion of the chemistry laboratory expansion in as a result  the current need for external funding will be reduced in future periods 
due to the capital needs inherent to our business and despite current capital markets uncertainties  we may decide to seek additional financing to support our objectives to enhance product development  expand existing markets and enter new markets  expand our chemistry research laboratories  fund participation in new therapeutic collaborations  or enhance our capital base for other purposes 
in making decisions regarding access to additional capital  we will consider the availability and terms of financing alternatives  as well as our objective to maintain financial flexibility to support planned and opportunistic growth of our business 
additional capital may be in the form of equity or debt securities  and may be raised in public offering or private placement transactions 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued foreign currency translations our foreign operations transact the majority of their business in their respective local currencies and are generally not exposed to material foreign currency gains or losses 
under certain circumstances  selected contracts may expose tripos to substantial foreign exchange risk 
at times we may experience some positive and or negative impact from foreign currency translations 
for example  under the terms of our contract with pfizer to perform discovery research services  we are currently being paid in us dollars and incurring related costs in great britain pounds sterling  which has had a negative impact on our gross margins in this business area in overall  however  due to the relative stability of the currency of the countries in which we operate and the level of investment in each country  our current intent is to retain assets within our foreign operations to fund those operations 
disclosures required under the sarbanes oxley act of on july  president bush signed into law the sarbanes oxley act of the act 
certain provisions of the act are currently applicable to tripos  but many other provisions do not become applicable until future dates 
tripos is currently reviewing the steps that will need to be taken to assure compliance with the act and related requirements of the sec and nasdaq 
section of the act effective for periods ending after december  requires companies to disclose all material off balance sheet transactions  arrangements  obligations and other relationships 
for the periods ending december  and  tripos had no off balance sheet transactions or arrangements other than ordinary operating leases that are further discussed in note of tripos consolidated financial statements contained in this form k 
in prior years we used a foreign sales corporation fsc for certain tax benefits arising from our foreign sales activities 
due to tax law changes  we have ceased use of this tax strategy and dissolved the fsc entity on december  the table that follows summarizes existing contractual obligations by type s omitted payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years bank debt capital lease obligations operating leases purchase obligations total interest rates on the floating rate long term debt are assumed to be constant for the purposes of this table 
for this table  we have assumed that the full amount of the  revolving credit facility is outstanding throughout and the first half of that would generate an interest payable of  at a constant rate of 
for the mortgage loan we have assumed an interest rate of until maturity in december purchase obligations represent remaining commitments for material capital expenditures building and equipment related to the expansion our chemistry laboratory at tripos receptor research and committed outsourcing of chemical production 
section of the act prohibits any new loans to officers and directors and renewals of existing loans to officers and directors  except in specific circumstances 
during we made a month loan to douglas a 
danne  our then senior vice president commercial operations in the amount of  of which  remained outstanding at december  mr 
danne left the company in late no payments were received during although we are continuing to take steps to collect the remaining amount outstanding 
however  due to mr 
danne s personal financial situation  the company took a charge in the first quarter of for the probability that the amount remaining due would not be repaid

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued cautionary statements additional important factors to be considered our future results could differ materially from those discussed in this annual report 
factors that could contribute to such differences  include  but are not limited to  the following we cannot be certain that our sales strategy will be effective in achieving additional sales of our products 
our strategy of providing direct integration of sophisticated information technology with the experimental sciences in the form of chemical laboratories to produce faster  more cost effective new product discovery has not yet garnered widespread commercial acceptance 
this integrated approach requires our sales force to broaden its existing knowledge base in selling discovery software to include selling software consulting and discovery research 
we cannot be certain that our sales force will be able to efficiently widen its knowledge base and then apply that information to make additional sales 
there can be no assurance that the market will accept our integrated approach or that competitors will not offer other approaches that gain greater technological acceptance 
we face uncertainty in raising additional capital that may be necessary to fund our operations 
we may seek to raise additional capital through additional public or private debt or equity financings  collaborative arrangements  borrowings or other available sources 
there can be no assurance that additional funding will be available on terms that are favorable to the company and its stockholders  if at all 
if additional capital is raised through the sale of equity or securities convertible into equity  the issuance of these securities could result in dilution to our existing stockholders 
if we cannot obtain additional financing when needed  we could be forced to curtail some of our current activities or delay implementation of other initiatives 
our current and potential customers consist primarily of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  which face risks that could affect our ability to sell our products 
we have benefited to date from the increasing trend among pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to outsource chemical research and development projects 
however  a reversal or slowing of this trend or a general economic downturn in these industries  such as experienced in  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
thus  our ability to generate revenue is subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause reductions and delays in research and development expenditures within our industry 
these risks and uncertainties are not within our control 
in addition  further consolidation in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries will reduce the number of our potential customers  and may adversely affect our future revenues 
if one of the parties to a consolidation uses the products or services of one of our competitors  we may lose existing customers as a result of such consolidation 
dependence on large customers 
we seek to enter into large  multi year contracts with large pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies 
it is difficult for us to predict when contracts of this nature will be awarded or the terms of these contracts 
in addition  the terms of these contracts may permit the customer to terminate the contracts or reduce their requirements 
we may not always be in a position to adjust utilization of our resources to the needs of one or more of these large contract customers 
we face intense competition 
we compete globally with the research departments of pharmaceutical companies  biotechnology companies  combinatorial chemistry companies  contract research companies and research and academic institutions in size  relative expertise and sophistication  speed and costs of identifying and optimizing potential lead compounds and developing and optimizing chemical processes 
these competitors may have greater financial and other resources and more experience than we have in certain research and development methods 
in addition  internal departments of corporations may be resistant to outsourcing software development  because it could reduce those departments budgets 
moreover  our competitors may  in the future  offer broader product lines or technologies or products that are more commercially attractive than our current or future products or that may render our technologies or products obsolete 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued we may incur significant costs in protecting our intellectual property rights or responding to claims of infringement from others 
our success will depend  in part  on our ability to obtain and enforce patents  protect trade secrets and copyrights  enforce restrictive licenses granted to third parties  obtain licenses to technology owned by third parties when necessary or developed in collaboration with us  and conduct our business without infringing the proprietary rights of others 
we currently rely upon a combination of trademark  patent  copyright and trade secret laws  employee and third party non disclosure agreements and other contracts to protect our proprietary rights 
nevertheless  our efforts to protect our intellectual property may be inadequate and we may be unable to prevent others from offering products and services substantially similar to ours 
we also need to secure and maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property outside of the united states  beca use our sales are global 
the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states  and many companies engaging in international business have encountered considerable difficulties in safeguarding their proprietary rights in foreign jurisdictions 
moreover  third parties may claim that our current or future products or services infringe upon their intellectual property 
litigation over these issues could be a significant distraction and we may incur significant costs  including several damages 
in the event that it is determined that one of our products infringe upon another s proprietary rights  we may be required to obtain a license in order to continue selling our products 
that license may not be available to us on favorable terms  or at all 
our quarterly operating results could vary significantly 
we have historically experienced fluctuations in our quarterly results 
quarterly operating results may continue to fluctuate as a result of a number of factors  including lengthy sales cycles  market acceptance of new products and upgrades  timing of new product introductions  changes in pricing policies  changes in general economic and competitive conditions  seasonal slowdowns  and the timing and integration of acquisitions 
we also expect to continue to experience fluctuations in quarterly operating results due to general and industry specific economic conditions that may affect the research and development expenditures of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 
due to the possibility of fluctuations in our revenues and expenses  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance 
our business and operating results could be adversely affected by our inability to accurately estimate the revenue or costs on a contract 
we seek to enter into long term contracts with our customers  which generally are accounted for on a percentage of completion basis 
this methodology requires the ability to accurately estimate total costs to be incurred in order to match revenues accordingly 
if we are unable to accurately estimate the costs of these projects  we may be required to defer costs and revenues on these contracts until milestone delivery events are achieved costs are assured 
profitability on these contracts may be driven by the extent of utilization of our billable personnel and our ability to control project costs 
accounting for a contract requires judgment relative to assessing the contract s estimated risks  revenue and costs  and on making judgments on other technical issues 
due to the size and nature of many of our contracts  the estimation of overal l risk  revenue and cost at completion is complicated and subject to many variables 
changes in underlying assumptions  circumstances  or estimates may also adversely affect future period financial performance 
our business is dependent upon the extent to which pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies collaborate with drug discovery companies for one or more aspects of their drug discovery process 
our commercial success depends on our ability to enter into joint venture or other collaborative arrangements with third parties 
to date  we have entered into numerous such arrangements with large pharmaceutical companies and emerging biotechnology companies 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to establish these collaborations  that any such collaborations will be on favorable terms  or that current or future collaborations will ultimately be successful 
our ability to convince pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to use our drug discovery capabilities  rather than develop them internally  will depend on many factors  including our ability to provide scientists and technologies that are of the highest caliber  develop drug discovery technologies that will result in the identification of higher quality drug candidates  achieve expected results within our customers timeframes  meeting quality and cost guidelines  and design  create and manufacture sufficient quantities of our chemical compounds for our customers 
even if we are able to address these factors  these customers may nevertheless determine to perform these activities internally or with other companies that provide services similar to ours 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued we are dependent on dr 
john mcalister  among others  and the loss of their services could affect our ability to be successful 
our future success depends to a significant degree upon the continued service of key senior management personnel  in particular  our president and chief executive officer  dr 
john p 
mcalister  as well as key technical personnel within the software  consulting and chemistry operations 
we believe that dr 
mcalister s reputation and prominence in the field provide us with a competitive advantage 
none of our key personnel is bound by an employment agreement or covered by an insurance policy where tripos is the beneficiary 
the loss of one or more key members could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
we may not be able to recruit and retain the experienced scientists we need to compete in our industry 
we compete with the research departments of pharmaceutical companies  biotechnology companies  combinatorial chemistry companies  contract research companies and academic institutions for new scientific personnel 
we compete with consulting companies for experienced computer programmers to carry out our software consulting contracts 
we cannot be assured that we will continue to be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel should the worldwide demand for these skilled individuals increase 
we believe that there is a shortage of  and significant competition for  scientists with the skills and experience in the sciences necessary to perform the services we offer 
in addition  our inability to hire additional qualified personnel may require an increase in the workload for both existing and new personnel 
we may not be successful in attracting new scientists or sales personnel or in retaining or motivating our existing personnel 
pharmaceutical and health care reform could reduce the amounts that pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have available to retain our services 
we expect that a substantial portion of revenues in the foreseeable future will be derived from services provided to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries 
if legislative proposals or reforms are adopted that have a material adverse effect on the businesses  financial condition  and results of operations of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that are actual or prospective customers  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely effected as well 
for example  future legislation could limit the prices pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can charge for the drugs they market 
this would have the effect of reducing the resources that these companies can devote to the research and development of new drugs  which would in turn reduce the amount of services that we perfor m and our resulting revenues 
item a 
market risk s our exposure to market risks is limited to foreign exchange variances and fluctuations in interest rates 
to date  interest rate exposure has not resulted in a material impact 
during  the company did experience a significant impact from foreign exchange 
the costs to perform the custom design and synthesis contract with pfizer are incurred in british pounds sterling while we are compensated in us dollars 
as a result  our gross profit was adversely affected by the decline in the us dollar against the pound 
part of this effect was offset through foreign currency forward contracts whose gains were recorded in other income 
our foreign exchange risk is presently limited to currencies that historically have exhibited only minor fluctuations although during  these currencies have shown more significant variation 
assets outside the united states are primarily located in england 
our investments in foreign subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the us dollar are not hedged 
the net assets in foreign subsidiaries translated into us dollars using the year end exchange rates were approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
the potential reduction in fair value resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
any loss in fair value of permanently invested funds would be reflected in other comprehensive income and would not impact our net income 
our interest rate risk is attributable to borrowings under the line of credit and mortgage loan 
during and early  we had fixed a portion of our floating rate interest risk on the mortgage loan through the purchase of swap instruments 
the interest rate swap agreements expired in april and were not replaced 
unrealized loss on our interest rate swap at december  was not significant 
we will continue to monitor our exposure to floating interest rate risk on line of credit borrowings along with the outstanding balance on the mortgage loan and will endeavor to mitigate this risk through the use of appropriate hedging instruments
