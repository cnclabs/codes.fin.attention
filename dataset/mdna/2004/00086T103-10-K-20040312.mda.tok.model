item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we are a rapidly growing specialty retailer offering a vast selection of arts  crafts and floral merchandise to a broad demographic of consumers 
our target customers are primarily women between the ages of and who are looking for ideas to decorate their homes  create handmade items  or otherwise engage in arts and crafts activities 
we have grown from stores in january to stores in december our stores are located in the eastern united states from new england to alabama 
we established our first store in moorestown  new jersey in and grew to five stores by the end of we added a total of additional stores in and in  we began implementing an aggressive expansion plan and built our infrastructure to position us for that growth 
by the end of  we had recruited experienced senior retail executives in the areas of operations  merchandising and finance  and made key additions and changes in other areas such as buying  information systems  human resources and real estate 
from through we continued to strengthen and expand our management team including the addition of lawrence h 
fine as our president in june we continued to develop our operating systems including a point of sale system  a radio frequency re order system  a real time merchandise information and control system  a warehouse management system and an automated ordering system using edi to link us electronically with most of our vendors 
we also implemented updated general ledger and payroll systems 
in  we received financing for our growth through an initial public offering of our common stock with net proceeds  after the payment of outstanding debt  of approximately million 
we received an additional million from the sale of shares in march our expansion plans continued as we opened ten new stores in  new stores in  new stores in and new stores in in we closed two stores  one was destroyed by fire and the other was in an area which had negative demographic changes and the lease had expired 
during the next two years  we intend to increase our store base by approximately per year  all within miles of our suburban philadelphia distribution center  an area encompassing approximately of the us population 
we believe we can operate at least stores in this area without significantly diluting sales in our existing stores 
to accommodate this growth  we are in the process of constructing a new distribution center to replace our existing facility 
the new distribution center will be  square feet plus  square feet of office space and will be located near our existing facility 
our sales for the year ended december   were million  an increase of over sales of million 
same store sales increased 
net income for the year increased by to million or per fully diluted share compared to net income of million or per fully diluted share in our success depends  in large part  on our ability to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to changing merchandise trends and consumer demands 
accordingly  any delay or failure by us in identifying and correctly responding to changing merchandise trends and consumer demand could adversely affect consumer acceptance of the merchandise in our stores 
in addition  we make decisions regarding merchandise well in advance of each of the seasons in which such merchandise will be sold 
significant deviations from projected demand for merchandise would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition  either from lost sales due to insufficient inventory or lower margins due to the need to mark down excess inventory 
in addition  our success depends on our ability to locate and open new store locations 
we plan to open new stores in we expect to open three stores in the first quarter  two in the second and the remainder split between quarters three and four 
we will also relocate two stores 
starting in  vendor monies which support our advertising programs will now be recorded as a reduction in the cost of inventory  and will be recognized as a reduction to cost of goods sold when the inventory is sold 
through  they were accounted for as an offset to advertising costs 
this accounting change results in a timing difference as to when these monies are recognized in our income statement and we estimate that the change will reduce eps by approximately 
per share 
the financial accounting standards board is working on a project to develop a new standard for accounting for stock based compensation 
tentative decisions by the fasb indicate that expensing of stock options will be required beginning january  the fasb expects to issue an exposure draft  which will be subject to public comment  in the first quarter and issue its final standard in the second half of results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  selected statement of operations data expressed as a percentage of net sales year ended december  net sales cost of sales gross margin selling  general and administrative expenses store pre opening expenses

sales were significantly impacted by the adverse weather conditions we experienced in the first and fourth quarters 
stores are added to the comparable store base at the beginning of the fourteenth full month of operation 
gross margin 
gross margin is net sales minus the cost of merchandise including certain distribution and purchasing costs 
the gross margin decreased to of net sales in from in the decrease is due to a a relative decline in our spring and summer floral and accessories business due to unseasonable weather conditions we experienced during the first eight months of the year  b general industry wide increases in domestic and international freight costs  and c the result of accelerated markdowns to clear seasonal inventory after major snow storms in the first and fourth quarters of included in gross margin for is  the net insurance proceeds of retail value over cost resulting from an insurance claim from a fire in one of our warehouses 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses include i direct store level expenses  including rent and related operating costs  payroll  advertising  depreciation and other direct costs  and ii corporate level costs not directly associated with or allocable to cost of sales including executive salaries  accounting and finance  corporate information systems  office facilities and other expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to of net sales in from in the decrease was the result of strong expense controls both in our stores and in the corporate office where we continue to leverage our costs over a greater sales base 
these expenses were of sales in compared with in selling  general and administrative costs benefited from the receipt of million in additional vendor co operative advertising funds over and a net credit of  which is comprised of a the proceeds in excess of costs resulting from an insurance claim for a fire which destroyed one of our stores and b the costs relating to the early termination of a lease on a store which we relocated 
store pre opening expenses 
we expense store pre opening costs as they are incurred 
pre opening expenses for the new stores opened in and one store which was relocated during the year  amounted to million 
in  we opened twelve new stores and incurred pre opening expenses of million

selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  in to million from million in of the million increase  million was attributable to the stores opened in which were not open during and the stores opened in which were not included in the comparable store base 
the remaining increase of million is attributable to the increase in corporate costs to support our growth 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative costs decreased to of net sales in from of net sales in this decrease is primarily due to leveraging store and central costs over a greater sales base

quarterly results and seasonality the following table sets forth our unaudited quarterly operating results for our eight most recent quarterly periods and the number of stores open at the end of each period dollars in thousands  except share and store data

comparable store sales increase decrease due to the importance of our peak selling season  which includes fall halloween  thanksgiving and christmas  the fourth quarter has historically contributed  and is expected to continue to contribute  virtually all of our profitability for the entire year 
as a result  any factors negatively affecting us during the fourth quarter of any year  including adverse weather and unfavorable economic conditions  would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for the entire year 
our quarterly results of operations also may fluctuate based upon such factors as the length of holiday seasons  the date on which holidays fall  the number and timing of new store openings  the amount of store pre opening expenses  the amount of net sales contributed by new and existing stores  the mix of products sold  the amount of sales returns  the timing and level of markdowns and other competitive factors 
liquidity and capital resources our cash is used primarily for working capital to support our inventory requirements and fixtures and equipment  pre opening expenses and beginning inventory for new stores 
in recent years  we have financed our operations and new store openings primarily with cash from operations  the net proceeds we received from our initial public offering in and with borrowings under bank financing agreements during portions of the year when our inventories peak 
in march we completed a secondary offering in which we sold  new post split shares with net cash proceeds of  at december  and  our working capital was million and million  respectively 
during  and  cash of million  million and million was generated by operations  respectively 
in these three periods  million  million and million of cash  respectively  was used to increase inventory levels to support both new and existing stores 
in these periods  part of the inventory increase was financed through increases in accounts payable of million  million and million  respectively 
we also had the tax benefit from our executives exercising stock options in the amount of million in and million in net cash used in investing activities during  and was million  million and million  respectively 
in this use of cash was for capital expenditures of million and million invested in marketable securities 
we spent million for land and the construction of our new distribution center  million for new stores and the remainder for remodeling existing stores  upgrading systems and warehouse equipment 
in and  cash used in investing activities was for capital expenditures including new stores  remodeling existing stores  upgrading systems and warehouse equipment 
in  we expect to spend approximately million on capital expenditures  which includes approximately million related to the building  equipment and systems for our new distribution center  million for new store openings  and the remainder for remodeling existing stores  upgrading systems in existing stores  and corporate systems development 
the total cost of the new distribution center is estimated to be million 
we expect to finance million of this project 
in the year ended december   net cash provided by financing activities was principally the million proceeds from our sale of shares in march in the year ended december   net cash provided by financing activities was million  principally as a result of million of proceeds received from equipment financing 
we currently have a million line of credit agreement with wachovia bank  which expires on january  borrowings under this line will bear interest at libor plus basis points 
at december  there were no borrowings outstanding under this agreement 
on october  we signed two mortgage agreements with wachovia bank relating to the new corporate offices and distribution center 
the mortgages make available million and are secured by land  building  and equipment 
borrowings under the mortgages are repayable at between seven and years and will bear interest rates that will vary between libor plus basis points and libor plus bassis points  depending on the debt service coverage ratio and the length of the mortgage payment 
we have the option of fixing the interest rate at any time 
at december  there were no borrowings outstanding under these mortgages 
we believe the cash generated from operations during the year  funds received through the financing of the new distribution center and available borrowings under the credit agreement will be sufficient to finance our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months 
we lease our retail stores  distribution center  satellite warehouse facilities  vehicles  and corporate headquarters under noncancelable operating leases 
at december  our total obligations under these operating leases were million 
in addition  we had capital lease obligations of  at december  the following table reflects as of december  the payments due for the periods indicated under our capital and operating leases 
payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years after years capital lease obligations store operating leases      vehicle and equipment leases  purchase obligations deferred income taxes total contractual cash obligations      most store leases have an average initial term of ten years  with two five year renewal options  and provide for predetermined escalation in future minimum annual rent 
the pro rata portion of scheduled rent escalations has been included in other long term liabilities in the balance sheet 
purchase obligations include agreements for goods and services that are enforceable and legally binding on the company and that specify all significant terms 
as of december   such obligations include telephone services and software licenses and maintenance contracts for information technology 
the amount of deferred income taxes has been excluded from the above table as the timing of any cash payment is uncertain 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our deferred tax position 
general on june   our board of directors approved a two for one stock split to shareholders of record as of the close of business on july  the shares were distributed on july  critical accounting estimates our accounting policies are more fully described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included herein 
as disclosed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
since future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty  actual results may differ from those estimates 
management makes adjustments to its assumptions and judgments when facts and circumstances dictate 
the amounts currently estimated by us are subject to change if different assumptions as to the outcome of future events were made 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and predicate those estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
management believes the following critical accounting estimates encompass the more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
merchandise inventories 
we value our inventories at stores at the lower of cost or market as determined using the retail inventory method 
because we do not have perpetual inventory records for inventory in our stores  we perform complete physical inventories in each of our stores at the end of each year 
the actual physical count of merchandise is made principally by third party inventory counting service firms 
inventory valuation methods also require certain management estimates and judgments 
these include estimates of net realizable value on product designated for clearance or on slow moving merchandise 
the accuracy of our estimates can be affected by many factors  some of which are outside of our control  including changes in economic conditions and consumer buying trends 
historically  we have not experienced significant differences in our estimates of recovery compared with actual results 
we believe our process results in reasonable estimates of our retail inventory on hand at year end 
impairment of long lived assets 
we periodically review long lived assets for impairment by comparing the carrying value of assets with their estimated future undiscounted cash flows 
to the extent these future estimates change  the conclusion regarding impairment may differ from our current estimates  and the loss  if any  would be recognized at that time 
the impairment loss is calculated as the difference between asset carrying values and the present value of estimated net cash flows or comparable market values  giving consideration to recent operating performance and pricing trends 
income taxes 
we do business in various jurisdictions that impose income taxes 
management determines the aggregate amount of income tax expense to accrue and the amount currently payable based upon the tax statutes of each jurisdiction 
this process involves adjusting income determined using generally accepted accounting principles for items that are treated differently by the applicable taxing authorities 
deferred tax liabilities are reflected on our balance sheet for temporary differences that will reverse in subsequent years 
if different judgments had been made  our tax expense  assets and liabilities could have been different 
other estimates 
management uses estimates in the determination of the required accruals for general liability  workers compensation  and health insurance 
these estimates are based upon examination of historical trends  industry claims experience and  in certain cases  calculations performed by third party experts 
projected claims information may change in the future and may require management to revise these accruals 
we are periodically involved in various legal actions arising in the normal course of business 
management is required to assess the probability of any adverse judgments as well as the potential range of any losses 
management determines the required accruals after a careful review of the facts of each legal action 
our accruals may change in the future due to new developments in these matters 
recent accounting pronouncements in november  the emerging issues task force reached consensus on issue  accounting by a customer including a reseller for cash consideration received from a vendor 
eitf issue addresses the accounting for cash consideration received by a customer from a vendor eg  slotting fees  cooperative advertising payments  buydowns and rebates or refunds from a vendor that is payable only if the customer completes a specified cumulative level of purchases or remains a customer for a specified time period 
the company has adopted the eitf effective for agreements modified or entered into after january  the company has historically treated cooperative advertising allowances as a reduction of advertising expense 
under eitf  cooperative advertising allowances should be treated as a reduction of inventory cost unless they represent a reimbursement of specific  incremental and identifiable costs incurred by the customer to sell the vendor s product 
since substantially all of the cooperative advertising allowance agreements for were entered into prior to january   this issue did not have a material impact on the financial statements 
the company has assessed the historic volume of cooperative advertising reimbursements that have been received in order to determine which of these reimbursements would meet the specific  identifiable and incremental criteria outlined under this issue and accordingly  qualify as a direct offset to advertising expense 
based on the company s analysis of the impact on net income  and the administrative cost to identify and track reimbursements between those qualifying for expense offset and those requiring inventory cost reduction  beginning in the company will treat all cooperative advertising funds received from vendors as a reduction in the cost of inventory and recognize them as a reduction to cost of goods sold when the inventory is sold 
we estimate that the prospective change in the timing of income recognition will reduce eps by approximately per share 
the adoption of this issue does not change the ultimate cash to be received under these agreements  only the timing of when it is reflected in net income 
statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations requires the recognition of a liability for the estimated cost of disposal as part of the initial cost of a long lived asset 
we adopted sfas in and it did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and supercedes emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
under eitf  a liability for an exit cost was recognized at the date of commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
this statement also establishes that fair value is the objective for initial measurement of the liability 
the adoption of this pronouncement did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin clarifies the application of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
the disclosure requirements of fin are effective for financial statements issued after january  the initial recognition provisions of fin are applicable immediately to new variable interests in variable interest entities created after january  for a variable interest in a variable interest entity created before february   the initial recognition provisions of fin are to be implemented no later than the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after june  we have determined that we do not have any variable interests in any variable interest entities 
therefore  no disclosure was required for the form k issued for the fiscal year ended december  and the adoption of the initial recognition provisions of fin did not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  fin  details the disclosures to be made by a guarantor about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
it also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
the company has issued no guarantees  and therefore  the adoption of fin has not had a material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations  or cash flows
