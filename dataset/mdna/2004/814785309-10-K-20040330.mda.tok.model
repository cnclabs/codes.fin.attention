the acquired assets consist primarily of approximately  funeral insurance policies in force in the state of mississippi 
the assets were originally acquired by acadian from gulf national life insurance company gnlic on june   consisting of all of gnlic s insurance policies in force and in effect on june  significant accounting policies and estimates the following is a brief summary of our significant accounting policies and a review of our most critical accounting estimates 
for a complete description of our significant accounting policies  see note to our financial statements 
insurance operations in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  premiums and considerations received for interest sensitive products such as universal life insurance and ordinary annuities are reflected as increases in liabilities for policyholder account balances and not as revenues 
revenues reported for these products consist of policy charges for the cost of insurance  administration charges  amortization of policy initiation fees and surrender charges assessed against policyholder account balances 
surrender benefits paid relating to these products are reflected as decreases in liabilities for policyholder account balances and not as expenses 
the company receives investment income earned from the funds deposited into account balances  a portion of which is passed through to the policyholders in the form of interest credited 
interest credited to policyholder account balances and benefit claims in excess of policyholder account balances are reported as expenses in the financial statements 
premium revenues reported for traditional life insurance products are recognized as revenues when due 
future policy benefits are recognized as expenses over the life of the policy by means of the provision for future policy benefits 
the costs related to acquiring new business  including certain costs of issuing policies and other variable selling expenses principally commissions  defined as deferred policy acquisition costs  are capitalized and amortized into expense 
for nonparticipating traditional life products  these costs are amortized over the premium paying period of the related policies  in proportion to the ratio of annual premium revenues to total anticipated premium revenues 
such anticipated premium revenues are estimated using the same assumption used for computing liabilities for future policy benefits and are generally locked in at the date the policies are issued 
for interest sensitive products  these costs are amortized generally in proportion to expected gross profits from surrender charges and investment  mortality and expense margins 
this amortization is adjusted when the company revises the estimate of current or future gross profits or margins 
for example  deferred policy acquisition costs are amortized earlier than originally estimated when policy terminations are higher than originally estimated or when investments backing the related policyholder liabilities are sold at a gain prior to their anticipated maturity 
death and other policyholder benefits reflect exposure to mortality risk and fluctuate from year to year on the level of claims incurred under insurance retention limits 
the profitability of the company is primarily affected by fluctuations in mortality  other policyholder benefits  expense levels  interest spreads ie  the difference between interest earned on investments and interest credited to policyholders and persistency 
the company has the ability to mitigate adverse experience through adjustments to credited interest rates  policyholder dividends or cost of insurance charges 
cemetery and mortuary operations pre need sales of funeral services and caskets revenue and costs associated with the sales of pre need funeral services and caskets are deferred until the services are performed 
pre need sales of cemetery interment rights cemetery burial property revenue and costs associated with the sales of pre need cemetery interment rights are recognized in accordance with the retail land sales provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the sales of real estate fas no 

under fas  recognition of revenue and associated costs from constructed cemetery property must be deferred until a minimum percentage of the sales price has been collected 
revenues related to the pre need sale of unconstructed cemetery property will be deferred until such property is constructed and meets the criteria of fas no 
described above 
pre need sales of cemetery merchandise primarily markers and vaults revenue and costs associated with the sales of pre need cemetery merchandise are deferred until the merchandise is delivered 
pre need sales of cemetery services primarily merchandise delivery and installation fees and burial opening and closing fees revenue and costs associated with the sales of pre need cemetery services are deferred until the services are performed 
prearranged funeral and pre need cemetery customer obtaining costs costs incurred related to obtaining new pre need cemetery and prearranged funeral business are accounted for under the guidance of the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises fas no 

obtaining costs  which include only costs that vary with and are primarily related to the acquisition of new pre need cemetery and prearranged funeral business  are deferred until the merchandise is delivered or services are performed 
revenues and costs for at need sales are recorded when a valid contract exists  the services are performed  collection reasonably assured and there are no significant obligations remaining 
mortgage operations mortgage fee income is generated through the origination and refinancing of mortgage loans and is realized in accordance with fas no 
the majority of loans originated are sold to third party investors 
the amounts sold to investors are shown on the balance sheet as due from sale of loans  and are shown on the basis of the amount of fees due from the investors 
use of significant accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
it is reasonably possible that actual experience could differ from the estimates and assumptions utilized which could have a material impact on the financial statements 
the following is a summary of our significant accounting estimates  and critical issues that impact them fixed maturities available for sale securities available for sale are carried at fair value  with unrealized holding gains and losses reported in accumulated other comprehensive income which is included in stockholders equity after adjustment for deferred income taxes and deferred acquisition costs related to universal life products 
the company uses fair market values based on national association of insurance commissioners naic values  versus values associated with normal marketing pricing services 
the company considers the difference to be immaterial 
the company is required to exercise judgment to determine when a decline in the value of a security is other than temporary 
when the value of a security declines and the decline is determined to be other than temporary  the carrying value of the investment is reduced to its fair value and a realized loss is recorded to the extent of the decline 
deferred acquisition costs amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs for interest sensitive products is dependent upon estimates of current and future gross profits or margins on this business 
key assumptions used include the following yield on investments supporting the liabilities  amount of interest or dividends credited to the policies  amount of policy fees and charges  amount of expenses necessary to maintain the policies  and amount of death and surrender benefits and the length of time the policies will stay in force 
these estimates  which are revised periodically  are based on historical results and our best estimate of future expenses 
cost of insurance acquired cost of insurance acquired is the present value of estimated future profits of the acquired business and is amortized similar to deferred acquisition costs 
the critical issues explained for deferred acquisition costs would also apply for cost of insurance acquired 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company accrues an estimate of potential losses for the collection of receivables 
the significant receivables are the result of the company s cemetery and mortuary operations and mortgage loan operations 
the allowance is based upon the company s experience 
the critical issues that would impact the cemetery and mortuary operations is the overall economy 
the critical issues for the mortgage loan operations would be interest rate risk and loan underwriting 
future policy benefits reserves for future policy benefits for traditional life insurance products requires the use of many assumptions  including the duration of the policies  mortality experience  expenses  investment yield  lapse rates  surrender rates  and dividend crediting rates 
these assumptions are made based upon historical experience  industry standards and a best estimate of future results and  for traditional life products  include a provision for adverse deviation 
for traditional life insurance  once established for a particular series of products  these assumptions are generally held constant 
unearned revenue the universal life products the company sells have a significant policy initiation fees front end load  which are deferred and amortized into revenues over the estimated expected gross profits from surrender charges and investment  mortality and expense margins 
the same issues that impact deferred acquisition costs would apply to unearned revenue 
deferred pre need cemetery and funeral contracts revenues and estimated future cost of pre need sales the revenue and cost associated with the sales of pre need cemetery merchandise and funeral services are deferred until the merchandise is delivered 
also  trust investment earnings from any pre need sales placed into trust are also deferred until the merchandise is delivered 
the company  through its mortuary and cemetery operations  provides a guaranteed funeral arrangement wherein a prospective customer can receive future goods and services at guaranteed prices 
to accomplish this  the company  through its life insurance operations  sells to the customer an increasing benefit life insurance policy that is assigned to the mortuaries 
if  at the time of need  the policyholder potential mortuary customer utilizes one of the company s facilities  the guaranteed funeral arrangement contract that has been assigned will provide the funeral goods and services at the contracted price 
the increasing life insurance policy will cover the difference between the original contract prices and current prices 
risks may arise if the difference cannot be fully met by the life insurance policy 
mortgage loan loss reserve the company accrues an estimate of future losses on mortgage loans sold to third party investors 
the company may be required to reimburse third party investors for costs associated with early payoff of loans within the first year of duration and to repurchase loans in default within the first year 
the estimates are based upon historical experience and best estimate of future liabilities

the mortgage subsidiary realizes cash flow from fees generated by originating and refinancing mortgage loans and interest earned on mortgages sold to investors 
the company considers these sources of cash flow to be adequate to fund future policyholder and cemetery and mortuary liabilities  which generally are long term  and adequate to pay current policyholder claims  annuity payments  expenses on the issuance of new policies  the maintenance of existing policies  debt service  and to meet operating expenses 
the company attempts to match the duration of invested assets with its policyholder and cemetery and mortuary liabilities

however  in accordance with company policy  any such securities purchased in the future will be classified as held to maturity 
business conditions  however  may develop in the future which may indicate a need for a higher level of liquidity in the investment portfolio

 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an action including certain costs incurred in a restructuring issue 
the principal difference between sfas no 
and issue is that sfas no 
requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred  rather than at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
sfas no

the modified prospective method recognizes stock based compensation expense related to new and unvested awards in the year of change equal to that which would have been recognized had sfas no 
been adopted as of its effective date  fiscal years beginning after december  the retrospective restatement method recognizes stock compensation costs for the year of change and restates financial statements for all prior periods presented as though the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
had been adopted as of its effective date 
since the company does not intend to voluntarily adopt the fair value presentation for fasb  adoption of sfas would not have a material effect on the financial condition or results of operations of the company
