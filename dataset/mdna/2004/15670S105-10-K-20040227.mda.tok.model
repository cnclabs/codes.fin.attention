item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations corporate overview we are one of north america s leading providers of printing  printing related products and value added services to meet the visual communications needs of customers 
our mission is to produce products and provide services that help our customers deliver their messages more effectively 
in october  we reorganized mail well into two business segments commercial and resale 
this reorganization aligns our structure with our principal strategic goals to operate as one company  to provide our customers with one point of entry into mail well  and to go to market with all of our products and services 
the commercial segment combines our commercial printing plants and the custom portion of our envelope business into a single business that generally sells directly to national and local customers 
the commercial segment consists of manufacturing facilities and five distribution and fulfillment centers and specializes in the printing of annual reports  car brochures  brand marketing collateral  financial communications  general commercial printing and customized envelopes for billing and remittance and direct mail advertising 
the resale segment combines all of our operations that sell to third party dealers such as print distributors  forms suppliers and office products retail chains 
this business consists of plants that produce a variety of products including business forms  business labels  custom and stock envelopes  specialty packaging and mailers 
business improvement initiatives 
our reorganization was a continuation of the evolution of mail well that began in june when we announced plans to divest certain businesses we had identified as non strategic 
in addition to these divestitures  we initiated a restructuring program to consolidate many of our manufacturing facilities to reduce excess capacity and improve our competitive position 
we also initiated other programs to significantly improve operations  reduce costs and increase marketing effectiveness 
in february  we sold curtis  the distribution business included in our printed office products business 
in may  we sold mail well label  our prime label business 
in august  we sold our filing products division  and in march  we sold certain of our digital graphics operations 
our divesture program is complete 
we have substantially completed our other restructuring programs  which included the following the consolidation of our best envelope equipment  expertise and operational capabilities into facilities  down from in the consolidation of our printing operations in the philadelphia market into one facility  the closure of our printing operation in new york city  and the consolidation of our web printing plant in indianapolis  indiana into our web printing plants in st 
louis  missouri and baltimore  maryland 
the consolidation of the denver  colorado and clearwater  florida business forms manufacturing facilities into our plants in girard  kansas  fairhope  alabama and marshall  texas 
the restructuring of our debt 
raw materials 
paper is our most significant raw material 
we purchase approximately  tons of paper annually to meet our production requirements 
historical changes in paper pricing generally have not affected the margins of our commercial printing products because we have been able to pass on paper price increases to our customers 
paper pricing has  however  impacted the margins of our envelope products 
when paper prices are rising  operating margins on our envelope products tend to be lower because we generally are not able to increase our prices as quickly as paper prices increase 
prices of coated papers  which are used principally in commercial printing  increased approximately in  decreased approximately in and remained flat in and prices of uncoated papers  which are the principal grades of paper used to manufacture envelopes  increased in the fourth quarter of the cost of uncoated papers had declined approximately during after a year of stable prices in margins of our envelope products were negatively impacted by higher uncoated paper prices in the first half of  however  the market for uncoated papers softened in the third quarter of as a result  the price of uncoated papers no longer negatively impacted operating margins of our envelope operations in the second half of in early  we received notifications from several paper companies announcing a increase in the price of uncoated paper 
we believe the current market conditions do not support this price increase 
however  if this price increase takes effect in  the margins of our envelope products will be negatively impacted in to the extent we are unable to increase the prices of our envelope products 
outlook 
the economic slowdown that began in continued to adversely affect the sales and margins of our businesses in and demand for many of our products  especially printed advertising and direct mail promotions  remained depressed at the end of the market for traditional business forms  which has been declining for several years  continues to decline 
these market conditions have led to overcapacity in our industry and significant competitive pricing pressures 
we do not expect internal growth or increases in margins until the markets we serve  particularly advertising and direct mail  recover 
our restructuring and other cost reduction initiatives have mitigated the impact of the downturn in our markets and we believe these actions have positioned us to benefit from improvements in our markets when they occur 
in the meantime  we have continued to manage our costs and balance production with the needs of our customers 
in october  congress instituted a federal do not call program  which our industry believes will increase demand for printed advertising and direct mail as our customers shift promotional spending from telemarketing to direct mail to reach their prospective customers 
the federal trade commission continues to operate the registry despite litigation brought to challenge its legality on regulatory and constitutional grounds 
if the challenge to the do not call program is successful  our sales could be adversely affected 
our reorganization into two business segments supports our total customer solutions initiative  through which we offer our customers a full spectrum of products and services from design through fulfillment including e services  direct mail and digital printing capabilities 
by offering the full breadth of our products and services as one company organized around the types of customers we serve  we believe we will be an easier company with which to do business 
we believe this new structure will greatly improve our ability to deliver our quality products and services with the speed  reliability and efficiency that our customers demand 
we also expect our customers to benefit as a result of a decrease in their total cost of procuring our products and services 
our total customer solutions sales and service teams are organized to focus on vertical markets including travel and leisure  health services  financial services and technology and to offer customers in these markets customized solutions to their visual communications needs 
in early  we launched a major initiative we refer to as mobilization 
mobilization is a comprehensive program to actively involve all of our employees in improving service  quality  efficiency and innovation 
we believe this initiative has improved teamwork  communication and accountability throughout our business and has resulted in many ideas which have improved operations  safety  customer service and reduced costs 
we believe the national do not call program and our total customer solutions and mobilization initiatives have had a positive impact on our business during and will continue to do so in the future 
consolidated results of operations the financial statements for all periods presented have been restated as required by generally accepted accounting principles to report the results of our prime label and curtis businesses as discontinued operations 
in analyzing our year over year financial results  it is important to recognize the following items that have had a significant impact on the comparability of our results over the last several years

the following table aggregates material expected contractual obligations and commitments as of december   as adjusted for the new senior subordinated notes sold on february  in thousands other long term operating long term purchase total cash debt leases liabilities commitments obligations thereafter     total      employment contracts 
we have an employment contract with paul reilly  our ceo  providing for severance payments under certain circumstances 
we have also entered into change of control agreements with certain other executives providing for severance payments in the event of a change of control 
off balance sheet arrangements 
we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons 
we expect to be able to fund our operations  capital expenditures  debt and other contractual commitments within the next year from internally generated cash flow and funds available under our senior secured credit facility 
the borrowing base certificate filed january   reflecting assets included in the december  consolidated balance sheet  reported million of unused credit available under our senior secured credit facility 
seasonality and environment our commercial segment experiences seasonal variations 
revenues from annual reports are generally concentrated from february through april 
revenues associated with holiday catalogs and automobile brochures tend to be concentrated from july through october 
as a result of these seasonal variations  some of our commercial printing operations are at or near capacity at certain times during these periods 
in addition  several envelope market segments and certain segments of the direct mail market  experience seasonality  with a higher percentage of the volume of products sold to these markets occurring during the fourth quarter of the year 
this seasonality is due to the increase in sales to the direct mail market due to holiday purchases 
the mailer operations of our resale segment are at or near capacity at times during the fourth quarter 
seasonality is offset by the diversity of our other products and markets  which are not materially affected by seasonal conditions 
environmental matters have not had a material financial impact on our historical operations and are not expected to have a material impact in the future 
critical accounting policies and judgments our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
in preparing these financial statements  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
we evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis  including those related to bad debts  property  plant and equipment  intangible assets  income taxes  and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are considered reasonable in view of relevant facts and circumstances 
because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates  actual results may differ from our estimates 
critical accounting policies are defined as those policies that relate to estimates that require assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and could have a material impact on our results due to changes in the estimate or the use of different estimates that reasonably could have been used 
allowances for losses on accounts receivable 
we maintain a valuation allowance based upon the expected collectibility of accounts receivable 
the allowance includes specific amounts for customer collection issues we have identified and an estimate of accounts that may become uncollectible based on the age of the receivables 
our accounts receivable allowance at december  was million 
in  we wrote off uncollectible accounts of million to the reserve net of recoveries 
in  we wrote off uncollectible accounts of million net of recoveries 
while credit losses have historically been within our expectations  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
these estimates may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have overstated or understated the reserve required for uncollectible accounts receivable 
goodwill 
we evaluate the carrying value of our goodwill as of december of each year  or if there are indications of impairment 
our evaluation is based on discounting the future cash flows of each of our business segments and comparisons to market multiples of other similar companies 
in preparing projected future cash flows  we use our judgment in projecting the profitability of our segments  their growth in future years  the capital spending required  the working capital requirements and the selection of a discount rate 
in our comparisons to market multiples of other similar companies  we use our judgment in the selection of the companies used in the analysis 
while we believe there is no further impairment of our goodwill  if our estimates of future cash flows prove to be inaccurate  an impairment charge could be necessary in future years 
impairment of long lived assets 
we periodically evaluate long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment and other intangible assets whenever events or changes in conditions indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the evaluation requires us to estimate future undiscounted cash flows associated with an asset or group of assets 
if the cost of the asset or group of assets cannot be recovered by these undiscounted cash flows  then an impairment may exist 
estimating future cash flows requires judgments regarding future economic conditions  product demand and pricing 
although we believe our estimates are appropriate  significant differences in the actual performance of the asset or group of assets may materially affect our asset values and require an impairment charge to future results 
self insurance 
we are self insured for the majority of our workers compensation costs and group health insurance costs  subject to specific retention levels 
we rely on claims experience and the advice of consulting actuaries and administrators in determining an adequate liability for self insurance claims 
our self insured workers compensation liability is estimated based on reserves for claims that are established by a third party administrator 
the estimate of these reserves is increased to reflect the estimated future development of the claims 
our liability for workers compensation claims is the estimated total cost of the claims on a fully developed basis 
our liability for workers compensation claims at december  was million 
the actuarial estimate of the cost of claims incurred in was million and million in in addition  in  we recorded a charge of million to adjust our workers compensation liability to a fully developed basis 
in  we recorded additional charges of million due to negative development of old claims 
our self insured healthcare liability is estimated based on our actual claims experience and multiplied by a lag factor 
our healthcare liability represents our estimate of claims that have been incurred but have not been reported 
the liability at december  was million 
the lag factor used to estimate this liability was approximately days 
while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate  significant differences in our experience or a significant change in any of our assumptions could materially affect our workers compensation costs and group health insurance costs 
accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure  together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes 
the tax effects of these temporary differences are recorded as deferred tax assets or deferred tax liabilities 
deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in our tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the statement of operations 
deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax items that have been deducted for tax purposes  but have not yet been recorded in the statement of operations 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets support the use of the future deduction or credit 
to the extent we believe that the use of the future tax asset is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate  tax planning strategies and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates  we are unable to implement certain tax planning strategies or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance that could have a material negative impact on our statement of operations and our balance sheet 
significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions 
we establish reserves when  despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable  we believe that certain positions are likely to be challenged and that we may not succeed 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the progress of a tax audit 
our effective tax rate includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that we consider appropriate  as well as related interest 
a company of our size is often under audit by various tax agencies in the jurisdictions in which we operate 
a number of years may elapse before a particular matter  for which we have established a reserve  is audited and finally resolved 
the number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction 
we currently have no open audits for the years prior to while it is difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter  we believe that our reserves reflect the probable outcome of known tax contingencies

forward looking statements certain statements in this report  and in particular  statements found in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of these statements are often identified by the words  believe  expect  intend  appear  estimate  anticipate  project  will and other similar expressions 
all such statements which address operating performance  events or developments that we expect or anticipate will occur in the future and are not historical in nature 
all forward looking statements reflect our current views of mail well with respect to future events and are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements 
as and when made  we believe that these forward looking statements are reasonable  however  these statements involve known and unknown risks  including  but not limited to general economic  business and labor conditions the ability of the company to implement its strategic initiatives the ability to sustain profitability after substantial losses in and the ability to successfully identify  manage or integrate possible future acquisitions sales are not subject to long term contracts the industry is extremely competitive the impact of the internet and other electronic media on the demand for envelopes and printed material postage rates and other changes in the direct mail industry environmental laws may affect our business the ability to retain key management personnel compliance with recently enacted and proposed changes in laws and regulations affecting public companies could be burdensome and expensive dependence on suppliers and the costs of paper and other raw materials the ability of the company to meet customer demand for additional value added products and services changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates of the canadian dollar the ability to manage operating expenses the risk that a decline in business volume or profitability could result in a further impairment of goodwill the ability to timely or adequately respond to technological changes in our industry the ability to extend our current credit facility beyond in view of such uncertainties  investors should not place undue reliance on any forward looking statements since such statements speak only as of the date when made 
we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks such as changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates  which may adversely affect results of operations and financial position 
risks from interest and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations are managed through normal operating and financing activities 
we do not utilize derivatives for speculative purposes  nor do we hedge interest rate exposure through the use of swaps and options or foreign exchange exposure through the use of forward contracts 
exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates relates primarily to our variable rate debt obligations 
the interest on this debt is the london interbank offered rate libor plus a margin 
at december  and  we had variable rate debt outstanding of million and million  respectively 
a increase in libor on the maximum amount of debt subject to variable interest rates  which was million in and million in  would increase our interest expense by million in and million in and reduce our net income by approximately million in and we have operations in canada  and thus are exposed to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates of the canadian dollar
