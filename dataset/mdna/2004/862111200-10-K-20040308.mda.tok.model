item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and associated notes found in item of this form k 
financial overview we increased revenue and earnings in  despite the fact that worldwide information technology spending was depressed for much of the year 
total revenue of billion was up compared to revenue increased as adjusted to reflect constant foreign currencies 
we had revenue growth in both of our business segments in  with a increase in storage products revenue and an increase in storage services revenue 
the increase in storage products revenue was primarily due to strong tape product sales and success in selling integrated storage solutions 
storage services revenue increased due to strong maintenance and support services revenue  as well as a growing revenue contribution from our professional service offerings 
we had a solid improvement in storage products gross profit margin due to favorable product mixes 
service margins decreased primarily due to increased investments in service resources 
all of our geographies contributed to the revenue growth in the fourth quarter of represented the fourteenth straight quarter we have increased our earnings on a year over year basis 
this earnings growth has been accomplished through a focus on profitable revenue growth  productivity improvements  and strong cost controls 
we continued to strengthen our balance sheet and cash flows during total cash and investments increased million to billion as of december  a increase from december we drove working capital efficiencies by reducing our inventory and accounts receivable balances from to our inventory levels decreased due to continuing lean manufacturing initiatives 
our accounts receivable balance decreased due to reductions in our past due receivable balances and improvements in our cash conversion cycle 
our operations are self funded and our debt to capitalization ratio remains constant at 
through our strong balance sheet and cash flows  we believe that we are firmly positioned to exploit the imminent rebound in the economy 
our primary challenge for the future is to continue to grow revenue 
we believe revenue growth can be achieved primarily through the successful execution of our information lifecycle management ilm strategy 
in  we will continue to focus on improving our sales productivity in europe 
we believe that recent organizational changes in europe will enable this improvement 
a potential risk to successfully growing our revenue and earnings in the future is a continuation of the global economic downturn and its impact on information technology spending

supplemental data storage products revenue tape products disk products network products other total storage products revenue revenue and gross profit margin storage products our storage products revenue consists of sales of tape products  disk products  and network products  including related software  for the mainframe and open systems markets 
the open systems market consists of products designed to operate in the unix  nt  and other non mvs operating environments 
storage products revenue increased in  compared to  primarily due to increases in tape and disk product sales 
we had a increase in tape product sales that was driven by strength in our virtual storage manager vsm system revenue  which increased from we also had a increase in both our high end and mid range tape drive revenue 
disk product revenue increased in  propelled by a increase in open systems disk product revenue 
we expanded our open systems disk product portfolio in  including our bladestore offerings 
the increase in open systems disk revenue was partially offset by an decrease in enterprise disk products 
storage products gross profit margin increased primarily due to a shift in product mix toward our higher margin products  led by the strength of our vsm sales 
revenue growth and margin increases benefited in from a particularly strong fourth quarter for vsm 
product mix  channel mix  and further operational efficiencies will be the key factors for maintaining and increasing storage products gross profit margin 
storage products revenue decreased in  compared to  primarily due to a decrease in tape product sales 
we believe the decline in tape product sales was primarily attributed to the global economic conditions and the associated weakness in information technology spending  which translated into lower unit sales in the decline in tape products was partially offset by increased sales of disk and network products 
storage products gross profit margin decreased slightly in  reflecting an increasing revenue contribution from our indirect channels  which typically carry lower gross profit margins 
the margin pressure was largely offset by our efforts to reduce product costs 
storage services our storage services revenue consists primarily of revenue associated with the maintenance and support of our storage products and third party storage products  as well as professional services revenue associated with diverse storage consulting activities 
storage services revenue increased in  compared to  primarily due to an increase in maintenance and support services revenue 
we also had strong revenue growth from selling new professional service offerings 
storage services gross profit margin decreased in  compared to  primarily due to additional investments in resources within the services arena that we made in in order to expand our reach into new markets 
the decrease in service margin was also due to increased revenue contributions from professional services  which typically carry lower margins than our traditional maintenance offerings 
professional services revenue accounted for of total storage services revenue in  compared to for if professional services become a greater portion of our service revenue  we expect that the resulting change in our services mix would continue to adversely impact our storage services gross profit margin 
storage services revenue increased in  compared to  driven largely by an expanded effort to sell services that help customers successfully manage their storage requirements  with balanced growth across our storage services portfolio 
new service offerings included various storage consulting services  implementation services  and storage management services 
storage services gross profit margin increased in  compared to  reflecting improvements in spare parts utilization and the service delivery process 
research and development research and development expenses have steadily decreased from through these decreases have been achieved primarily through the implementation of engineering initiatives designed to improve research and development productivity  increase strategic alignment  and reduce non essential spending 
we continue to align our engineering functions to support the aims of our ilm strategy and improve productivity 
we conduct research and development activities primarily internally  but we also enter into strategic partnerships and outsourcing arrangements for certain research and development activities 
no single research or development project is expected to be individually material to our financial condition or results of operations  either in terms of the estimated future cost to complete or in terms of expected future revenue or cash flows resulting from the completion of the project 
selling  general  and administrative expense selling  general  and administrative expense sg a increased in  compared to  primarily due to increased commission and bonus expenses as a result of our improved financial performance 
sg a also increased during as a result of investments in sales coverage and marketing initiatives designed to promote our ilm strategy 
sg a remained largely unchanged in  compared to sg a as a percentage of total revenue has remained relatively consistent during   and interest income and expense interest income and expense were largely unchanged in compared to and although our cash and investments balance has been increasing  decreasing interest rates have kept our interest income relatively unchanged

income taxes our effective tax rate is impacted by a variety of factors  including the overall effectiveness of our global manufacturing strategies and changes in our estimates regarding the resolution of open tax matters 
the following table summarizes our provisions for income taxes and effective tax rates both as reported on the consolidated statements of operations and as adjusted to reflect the resolution of open tax matters in thousands fiscal year ended december provision effective rate provision effective rate provision effective rate as reported    resolution of open tax matters   adjusted    the resolution of open tax matters has resulted in a reduction in our tax provision of million during and million in adjusting the reported tax provision to exclude these discrete tax events  our effective tax rate has decreased steadily from in to in this reduction in our effective tax rate reflects the fact that we continue to recognize increased tax benefits associated with our manufacturing operations in puerto rico 
we expect that the effective tax rate will continue to decrease in we are subject to regular audits by federal  state  and foreign tax authorities 
these audits may result in proposed assessments that may result in additional tax liabilities 
our income taxes payable balance as reported on the consolidated balance sheet is comprised primarily of tax contingencies that we believe are both probable and reasonably estimable 
our effective tax rate does not include us tax on undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries because such earnings are intended to be reinvested indefinitely outside of the us the determination of amounts to be reinvested is based on the projected cash flow needs and the working capital and long term investment requirements of our foreign subsidiaries and domestic operations 
if excess cash has accumulated in the foreign subsidiaries and it is advantageous for business operations  tax  or foreign exchange reasons  a portion of the subsidiary earnings may be remitted 
if such a determination is made  we would provide for the us taxes due on those amounts at the time the determination is made 
material changes in our estimates of cash  working capital  and long term investment requirements could impact our effective tax rate 
we have approximately million of deferred tax assets as of december   which are recorded in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
our valuation allowance of approximately million relates principally to foreign net operating loss carryforwards 
see critical accounting estimates and assumptions accounting for income taxes for further description of our critical accounting estimates and assumptions for income taxes 
critical accounting estimates and assumptions management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  related revenue and expenses  and disclosure of gain or loss contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates and assumptions 
management has discussed the development  selection  and disclosure of our critical accounting estimates and assumptions with the audit committee of our board of directors 
we believe that the application of the following critical accounting estimates and assumptions represent our more significant judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the majority of our products and services are delivered subject to agreements with standard terms and conditions 
in certain situations  however  our agreements may include non standard terms and conditions 
in these situations  we must make judgments to determine the appropriate accounting 
these judgments generally involve assessments regarding matters such as whether there are sufficient legally binding terms and conditions whether customer acceptance has been received whether the price to the customer is fixed or determinable whether collection is reasonably assured we evaluate the sufficiency of the terms and conditions of our agreements  as well as whether customer acceptance has been received  based on management s judgments  and as appropriate  advice from legal counsel 
we evaluate whether the price to the customer is fixed or determinable based on historical experience 
if we conclude that we cannot reliably estimate future returns  we utilize a sell through method of accounting 
for those sales recognized under the sell in method of accounting  we record reductions in revenue for anticipated future returns 
we record reductions to revenue for sales price adjustments 
the reserves for anticipated future returns and sales price adjustments are determined based on our historical claims and returns experience 
our actual experience in future periods with respect to returns and sales price adjustments may differ from our historical experience 
we perform a quarterly analysis of our historical bad debt write off experience to assess the reserve requirements for our aged receivables 
we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on both a specific analysis of known situations where we anticipate that customers will be unable to meet their financial obligations and a general analysis of past due receivables and our historical collection experience with similar accounts 
if circumstances related to a specific customer change  or if our historical bad debt write off experience changes as a result of changes in global economic conditions or other changes in our business  we may need to subsequently adjust our allowance for doubtful accounts 
for additional information related to our allowance for doubtful accounts  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  included in item of this form k 
warranty costs and liability our standard product warranties provide for the repair or replacement of products that fail to meet their published specifications 
in situations where a product fails its essential purpose to the customer  we may also be responsible for refunding the purchase price of the product to the customer if we cannot remedy the product failure 
we establish a warranty liability for the estimated cost of warranty related claims at the time revenue is recognized 
the amount of the warranty liability reflects our estimate of the expected future costs of fulfilling our obligations under the warranties 
in developing our estimate  we consider our historical experience  the length of the warranty period  and the expectations for new products 
if we discover a product design flaw or other unanticipated problem  our actual warranty costs may differ significantly from our original estimates 
if we determine that an increased warranty reserve is necessary  we would increase the warranty liability and cost of revenue in the period the determination was made 
the warranty liability is reviewed quarterly to verify that it properly reflects management s best estimate of the remaining warranty obligations 
for additional information related to our warranty reserves  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  included in item of this form k 
inventory valuation we establish and evaluate our inventory reserve estimates for obsolete  slow moving  and non saleable inventory based on a quarterly review of inventory cost versus estimated market value 
market value estimates involve significant judgments about a number of factors  including the impacts of future product or technology introductions by us or by our competitors  delays in the availability of new products  changes in the purchasing patterns of our customers  and changes in global economic conditions 
to the extent that inventory cost exceeds estimated market value  we would increase our inventory reserve  which would result in a corresponding charge to cost of revenue 
for additional information related to our inventory reserves  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  included in item of this form k 
accounting for income taxes we are subject to regular audits by federal  state  and foreign tax authorities 
these audits may result in proposed assessments that may result in additional tax liabilities 
we account for income tax contingencies in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
our income taxes payable balance as reported on the consolidated balance sheet is comprised primarily of tax contingencies that we believe are both probable and reasonably estimable 
future benefits or charges to our reported income tax provision can result from the resolution of open tax matters 
some factors that may result in a change in our estimates for contingent tax matters include the expiration of statutes of limitations changes in tax regulations tax rulings  settlements  and other factors affecting estimates of tax contingencies the interaction of all these factors  together with any opportunities for us to minimize the impact of these factors through the carryback or carryforward of any associated tax liabilities or benefits in the multiple tax jurisdictions where we do business  is very complex and requires considerable judgment 
furthermore  these uncertainties may require an extended period of time to resolve and may not be determinable prior to the time the statutes of limitations expire in the respective tax jurisdictions 
while we believe that we have appropriately provided for income taxes for all years  any of these factors may result in significant adjustments to our tax provision 
any adjustments to our reserves for tax contingencies may result in benefits or charges that would impact our reported financial results in future periods 
deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the expected tax consequences of transactions that are recognized in different time periods for book and tax purposes 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount of the tax benefit that we believe will be realized in the future 
we assess the need for a valuation allowance by reviewing our earnings history  the number of years that our operating losses and tax credits can be carried forward  and future taxable income expectations by tax jurisdiction 
we perform an ongoing assessment to determine whether there is a need to increase or decrease the valuation allowance based on our expected realization of the deferred tax assets 
any adjustment to the valuation allowance would impact our tax provision

liquidity and capital resources sources and uses of cash the following table summarizes our cash flows from continuing operations in thousands fiscal year ended december operating activities    investing activities    financing activities    our cash and cash equivalents balance increased million in and million in the increase in cash and cash equivalents in was primarily a result of cash flows generated by our operations 
while cash flow from operations was basically unchanged compared to  the gross amounts of cash received and paid increased primarily due to growth in revenue 
cash provided by operating activities increased million in  compared to  primarily due to our efforts to effectively manage working capital 
in  cash used in investing activities included net purchases of short and long term investments of million 
in  cash used in investing activities included the repurchase of million of tape storage equipment from eds in connection with a secondary storage services agreement 
in  cash provided by financing activities included million of proceeds from employee stock plans  an increase of from cash used in financing activities increased million in  primarily due to repayments of borrowings under our credit facilities in future sources and uses of cash we expect that cash flows from operations will continue to serve as our principal source of liquidity  and we believe that we have adequate working capital and financing capabilities to meet our anticipated operating and capital requirements for the next months 
we also anticipate that our cash balance will continue to increase  primarily as a result of our operating activities 
however  cash flows from operations could be negatively impacted by a decrease in demand for our products and services as a result of rapid technological changes and other risks described under factors that may affect future results 
in january  our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program to acquire up to  shares of common stock per quarter through the intent of the repurchase program is to offset dilution created by shares issued under employee stock plans 
we intend to fund the repurchases through cash flows from operations 
cash flows from operations can be supplemented by our million revolving credit facility the revolver that expires in october the interest rates for borrowing under the revolver are dependent on our total debt to rolling four quarter earnings before interest expense  taxes  depreciation  and amortization ebitda ratio and the term of the outstanding borrowings 
the rate ranges from the applicable libor plus to or the agent bank s base rate plus to 
we pay a per annum commitment fee on any unused borrowings 
we had no outstanding borrowings under the revolver as of december  the revolver is secured by our us accounts receivable and us inventory  and contains certain financial and other covenants  including a prohibition on the payment of cash dividends 
over the longer term  we may choose to fund our operations through the issuance of additional equity or debt financing 
the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities could result in dilution to our stockholders  and we cannot provide any assurance that such additional long term financing  if required  could be completed on favorable terms 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years more than years capital leases      operating leases      purchase obligations     total      the majority of our purchase obligations relate to a ten year agreement with eds  under which we outsourced certain internal information technology and customer call center operations to eds 
factors that may affect future results we may be materially affected by global economic and political conditions our ability to generate revenue growth during the last several years was adversely affected by the slowdown in the global economy as customers delayed their purchase decisions  reduced their information technology spending budgets  increased their purchase authorization approval requirements  and reduced their capital expenditures by maximizing the current capacities of their data storage equipment 
during the last several years  we implemented various cost saving measures to help mitigate the adverse effects of the slowdown in the global economy 
we cannot provide any assurance that a prolonged economic downturn will not have additional adverse effects on our financial condition  results of operations  or our ability to generate revenue growth 
furthermore  we cannot provide any assurance that our cost saving measures will be successful or sufficient to allow us to continue to generate improved operating results in future periods 
our financial condition and results of operations could also be materially affected by unstable global political conditions 
terrorist attacks or acts of war could significantly disrupt our operations and the operations of our customers  suppliers  distributors  or resellers 
we cannot predict the potential impact on our financial condition or results of operations should such events occur 
we may be materially affected by a decrease in demand for our tape products or by an inability to maintain key competitive advantages in tape in  approximately of our storage products revenue was generated by sales of our tape products 
services associated with our tape products also represent a significant portion of our storage services revenue 
if overall demand for tape storage products declines  or if we lose market share in tape  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected 
one of the key competitive advantages that our tape products have over competing disk products is that tape products store data at a fraction of the price of disk storage 
the price of disk storage continues to decrease rapidly due to competition and decreasing manufacturing costs associated with new disk drive technologies such as advanced technology attachment ata 
we must continue to develop and introduce new tape products that reduce the cost of tape storage at a rate that is similar to or greater than the decline in disk storage costs in order to maintain this competitive advantage 
we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to reduce the cost of our tape products at a rate similar to the decline in disk storage costs 
we may be materially affected by competition and by our ability to execute our ilm strategy to address competition the data storage industry is highly competitive  and customers make their decisions based on a number of competitive factors 
we must address each of these factors effectively in order to successfully compete 
if we are unable to adapt our products and services to changes in these competitive factors  we may lose market share to our competitors 
our principle strategy for addressing the competition and growing revenue is our ilm strategy 
our ilm strategy is intended to capitalize on our ability to deliver complete storage solutions that satisfy customer storage requirements  including tape  disk  and network products  together with associated services 
we achieved some initial success in our ilm strategy in  however  we must continue to develop and deliver on this strategy in the future in order to grow revenue 
we have also seen the adoption of strategies similar to our ilm strategy by our competitors 
we cannot provide any assurance that we will successfully execute our ilm strategy or that this strategy will provide us with a competitive advantage in the data storage industry 
we may be materially affected by the risks associated with expanding our service offerings services contributed approximately of our total revenue in  compared to in and in this growth was partially driven by new service offerings such as storage consulting services  implementation services  and storage management services 
the development and delivery of these new services are critical to the success of our plan to deliver complete storage solutions to our customers 
we must ensure that service professionals have the necessary skill sets  experience  tools  and training to support these new service offerings 
revenue growth from these new service offerings is needed to offset possible future declines in maintenance revenue from our installed service base of products under maintenance contracts as these products are displaced by sales of new storagetek products under warranty 
any failure to properly develop or deliver our new and existing service offerings could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we may be materially affected by uneven sales patterns and by our ability to forecast customer demand accurately in the past  our results have followed a seasonal pattern  which reflects the tendency of customers to make their purchase decisions at the end of a calendar year 
during any fiscal quarter  a disproportionately large percentage of total product sales are earned in the last weeks or days of the quarter 
we continued to experience these trends in it is difficult to predict the extent to which these historical trends will continue in the future 
we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to manage our uneven sales patterns 
we prepare and update our forecasts on a regular basis to predict customer demand for our products and services 
if actual demand exceeds predicted demand  we may not be able to meet customer requirements in a timely manner due to sourcing  manufacturing  or service constraints 
if actual demand is less than predicted demand  we may have excess inventory or an underutilized employee base 
we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to forecast customer demand accurately or respond quickly to changes in customer demand 
our gross profit margin may be materially affected by product mix  channel mix  and resale of third party products we provide a variety of solutions to meet customer needs  including tape  disk  and network products  along with associated services 
our products and services contribute varying gross profit margins  and the gross margin on a customer s total solution is dependent on the amounts and types of products or services involved 
we cannot provide any assurance that our future gross profit margin will be similar to our historical gross profit margin 
we market our solutions through a combination of a direct sales organization and indirect channel partners 
direct sales to the end user customer usually result in higher gross profit margins than indirect channel sales 
we cannot provide any assurance that changes in our channel mix will not have a material impact on gross profit margin in the future 
third party product sales continue to increase as a percentage of total product sales  and our gross profit margin may be adversely affected as those products become a larger portion of our total storage solutions 
we may also be at a cost disadvantage in acquiring third party products that are manufactured by competitors 
we may be materially affected by our ability to grow our indirect channels successfully we are continually developing our indirect distribution channels  including original equipment manufacturers oems  value added distributors vads  value added resellers vars  and other distributors 
indirect channel sales contributed approximately of our total product revenue in  compared to in and in increasing our sales through these indirect channels is critical to expanding our reach into the growing open systems market 
successfully managing the interaction of our direct and indirect channel efforts to effectively reach all of the potential customer segments for our products and services is a complex process 
we cannot provide any assurance that we will be successful in expanding our indirect channel sales 
our ability to forecast future demand for our products may be adversely affected by unforeseen changes in demand from our indirect channel partners 
storage products gross profit margins may be adversely impacted to the extent we continue to receive a larger portion of our sales through our indirect channels in the future 
maintenance revenue may also be adversely affected in future periods to the extent that customers of our indirect channel partners elect to purchase maintenance services from our competitors 
our financial results may also be negatively affected if the financial condition of one or more of our channel partners weakens 
we may be materially affected by the risks associated with sole source suppliers we purchase certain key parts  components  and services from sole source suppliers who we believe are currently the only providers that meet our specifications or for which alternative sources of supply are not readily available 
the following table shows our significant sole source suppliers and the products or services they provide name of supplier product or service provided imation corporation t and t series tape media sanmina sci corporation printed circuit boards and certain other manufacturing and repair services lsi logic storage systems d series disk products fujitsu electronics america application specific integrated circuits asics for various tape and disk products philips semiconductors asics for various tape and disk products herald datanetics ltd 
hdl key component used in certain tape products we also obtain certain key parts and components from less significant sole source suppliers 
if a sole source supplier did not continue to provide its products or services  we would need to identify and qualify other acceptable suppliers 
this process could take an extended period  and we cannot provide any assurance that we could identify and qualify an alternative source on a timely basis or at an acceptable quality or price 
we cannot provide any assurance that significant sole source suppliers will be able to meet our ongoing quality or delivery requirements 
failure to meet these requirements may have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
hdl is located in the people s republic of china prc 
our dependence on hdl is subject to additional risks beyond those associated with other sole source suppliers  including the lack of a well established court system or acceptance of the rule of law in the prc  the degree to which the prc permits economic reform policies to continue  the political relationship between the prc and the united states  and broader political and economic factors 
to date  we have not experienced any material problems securing key components from hdl  however  we cannot provide any assurance that we will not experience material problems in the future 
we may be materially affected by a failure to obtain quality parts and components in a timely manner or by a failure to effectively manage inventory levels we generally use standard parts and components for our products and believe that there are a number of alternative  competent vendors for most of those parts and components 
certain suppliers have experienced occasional technical  financial  or other problems that have delayed deliveries in the past 
an unanticipated failure of one of our suppliers to meet requirements for an extended period  or the inability to secure comparable components in a timely manner  could result in a shortage of key components or products  longer lead times  reduced control over production and delivery schedules  and an inability to fulfill customer orders in a timely manner 
we have reduced our inventory levels by over in and over in  primarily as a result of lean manufacturing initiatives 
as we continue to move toward a lean manufacturing environment  we will become increasingly dependent on a limited supplier base to deliver quality parts and components in a timely manner 
a supplier s inability to deliver parts and components on a timely basis  or our failure to effectively manage inventory levels  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we may be materially affected by rapid technological change and evolving industry standards short product life cycles are inherent in high technology industries due to rapid technological change and evolving industry standards 
our financial condition and results of operations depend on our ability to respond effectively to these changes 
we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to successfully develop  manufacture  and market innovative new products or adapt our current products to new technologies or new industry standards 
in addition  customers may be reluctant to adopt new technologies and standards  or they may prefer competing technologies and standards 
storage area network san solutions are an example of the rapid technological change in our industry 
san technologies and standards are continually evolving 
we continue to develop the necessary product modifications and professional services knowledge to implement our san solutions successfully in various customer operating environments 
because the san market changes so quickly  it is difficult to predict the future rate of adoption of our san solutions 
we may be materially affected by risks associated with new product development new product research and development is complex and requires the investigation and evaluation of multiple alternatives  as well as planning the design and manufacture of those alternatives selected for further development 
research and development efforts could be adversely affected by any of the following hardware and software design flaws product development delays changes in data storage technology changes in operating systems changes in industry standards in addition  we have outsourced software development for certain tape and network products 
we cannot provide any assurance that research and development activities will be successful in bringing new products to market 
manufacturing new products involves integrating complex designs and processes  coordinating with suppliers for parts and components  and managing manufacturing capacities to accommodate forecasted demand 
failure to obtain sufficient quantities of parts and components  as well as other manufacturing delays or constraints  could adversely affect the timing of new product introductions 
we have experienced product development and manufacturing delays in the past that adversely affected our results of operations and competitive position 
when we introduce new products  we must effectively manage the transition from our existing products to the new products 
if we do not manage the transition effectively  we may be subject to the following adverse effects excess or obsolete inventory insufficient inventory or manufacturing capacity to meet customer demand delayed customer purchases lost sales if customers purchase from our competitors in addition  sales of our new products may replace some of the sales of our existing products 
we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to successfully manage the development  introduction  or transition of new products in the future 
we may be materially affected by the risks associated with developing and protecting intellectual property we depend on our ability to develop new intellectual property that does not infringe on the rights of others 
we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to continue to develop such new intellectual property 
we rely on a combination of us patent  copyright  trademark  and trade secret laws to protect our intellectual property rights 
we enter into confidentiality agreements relating to our intellectual property with our employees and consultants  and we include confidentiality provisions in license and non exclusive sales agreements with our customers 
we also file patent and trademark registration applications with foreign governments  however  many foreign countries do not have intellectual property laws that are as well developed as those of the united states 
despite all of our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain or use our intellectual property 
monitoring the unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult  particularly in foreign countries 
we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to adequately protect our intellectual property 
we may be materially affected if we are unable to attract and retain our key employees our future success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain our key employees 
during  several changes were made with respect to the executive management team and their organizational responsibilities 
we face significant competition for individuals who possess the skills required to sell our products and services  as well as design  develop  manufacture  service  and market those products and services 
an inability to successfully attract and retain these employees could have an adverse effect on our future financial condition and results of operations 
furthermore  there may be a delay between when organizational announcements are made and when the organizations are fully effective 
we may be materially affected by the risks of conducting business outside the united states international operations accounted for approximately of our revenue in  compared to in and in we also sell products through us indirect channel partners that have some of their end user customers located outside the united states 
we expect that we will continue to generate a significant portion of our revenue from international operations 
our international business may be affected by changes in demand resulting from global and localized economic  business  and political conditions 
we are subject to the risks of conducting business outside the united states  including the following risks adverse political and economic conditions impositions of tariffs or quotas changes in laws or regulations difficulty in obtaining export licenses potentially adverse tax or labor laws the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws longer payment cycles typically associated with international sales other factors outside our control we expect these risks to increase in the future as we expand our operations in eastern europe  latin america  and asia 
we cannot provide any assurance that these factors will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations in the future 
we may be materially affected by the weee directive the european union has finalized the waste electrical and electronic equipment weee directive  which regulates the collection  recovery  and recycling of waste from electrical and electronic products  and the restrictions on the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment rohs directive  which bans the use of certain hazardous materials including lead  mercury  cadmium  chromium  and halogenated flame retardants 
under weee  we will be responsible for financing operations for the collection  treatment  disposal  and recycling of past and future covered products 
because the specific legal requirements have not been finalized  we are presently unable to reasonably estimate the amount of any costs that may be necessary in order to comply with weee 
we cannot provide any assurance that compliance with weee and rohs will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
our manufacturing operations may be materially affected by weather related risks we manufacture and assemble a significant portion of our products in puerto rico 
our ability to perform these activities may be significantly affected by weather related risks beyond our control 
we believe that if the puerto rico facilities were significantly affected by adverse weather  we could relocate to an alternative facility within a reasonable period of time  however  we cannot provide any assurance that we would be able to relocate to that facility without a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
we may be materially affected by restructuring activities we have recognized significant restructuring charges in the past and it is possible that changes in our business  industry  or in the global economy may necessitate restructuring activities in the future 
the necessity for restructuring activities may result in expenses that adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and may require incremental cash payments 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange rate risk our primary market risk relates to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the functional currency for our foreign subsidiaries is the us dollar 
a significant portion of our revenue is generated by our international operations 
the majority of our international operations involve transactions denominated in the euro  pound sterling  and japanese yen 
an increase in the exchange value of the us dollar reduces the value of revenue and profits generated by our international operations 
as a result  our financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows can be materially affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
we attempt to mitigate this exposure as part of our foreign currency hedging program 
the primary goal of our foreign currency hedging program is to reduce the risk of adverse foreign currency movements on the reported financial results of our non us dollar transactions 
factors that could have an impact on the effectiveness of our hedging program include the accuracy of forecasts and the volatility of foreign currency markets 
all foreign currency derivatives are authorized and executed pursuant to our policies 
we do not hold or issue derivatives or any other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
to implement our foreign currency hedging program  we use foreign currency options and forwards 
these derivatives are used to hedge the risk that forecasted revenue denominated in foreign currencies might be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
foreign currency forwards are also used to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in connection with monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
a hypothetical adverse movement in foreign exchange rates applied to our foreign currency exchange rate sensitive instruments held as of december   and as of december   would result in a hypothetical loss in fair value of approximately million and million  respectively 
the determination of the fair value of these instruments is described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  included in item of this form k 
the decrease in the hypothetical loss for is primarily due to a decrease in net outstanding derivatives 
these hypothetical losses do not take our underlying international operations into consideration 
we anticipate that any hypothetical loss associated with our foreign currency exchange rate sensitive instruments would be substantially offset by gains associated with our underlying international operations 
interest rate risk changes in interest rates primarily affect interest income earned on our cash investments 
a hypothetical adverse movement in interest rates applied to cash investments would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
credit risk we are exposed to credit risk associated with cash equivalents  investments  foreign currency options and forwards  and trade receivables 
we do not believe that our cash equivalents  investments  or foreign currency derivatives present significant credit risks  because the counterparties to the instruments consist of major financial institutions  and we manage the notional amount of contracts entered into with any one counterparty 
substantially all trade receivable balances are unsecured 
the concentration of credit risk with respect to trade receivables is limited by the large number of customers in our customer base and their dispersion across various industries and geographic areas 
although we have a large number of customers who are dispersed across different industries and geographic areas  a prolonged economic downturn could increase our exposure to credit risk on our trade receivables 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and maintain an allowance for potential credit losses
