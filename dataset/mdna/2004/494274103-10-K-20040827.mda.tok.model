the nature of the contract electronics manufacturing industry is such that the start up of new customers and new programs to replace expiring programs occurs frequently 
new customer and program start ups generally cause losses early in the life of a program  which are generally recovered as the program matures and becomes established 
this segment continues to experience margin pressures related to an overall excess capacity position in the electronics subcontracting services market and more specifically this segment s new customer and program diversification efforts

the effective income tax rate decreased percentage points in fiscal year compared to fiscal year as the federal effective tax rate declined from fiscal year and the state effective tax rate increased in fiscal year the reduced effective tax rate was partially due to a much lower profit before income tax base coupled with relatively stable amounts of tax benefits associated with the company s investment in tax free municipal bonds and research and development activities
