the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements  including the notes thereto  included elsewhere in this annual report 
overview since our inception in  we have focused our efforts on developing and manufacturing innovative biomaterial based medical devices for use in topical wound closure and wound care in humans and animals 
in addition  our research efforts include the development of internal adhesive products 
in  we established a new strategic plan for the corporation 
building upon our expertise in biomaterials  we will pursue three clinical platforms to address unmet medical needs and we are actively pursuing the clinical areas of topical wound care  internal surgical sealants and new complementary technologies 
in order to execute our strategic plan and support our growth  we reorganized our management structure to enhance the strength of our business and added new senior management team members 

table of contents during  dermabond adhesive continued to be our main revenue contributor  aided by the introduction of high viscosity dermabond  a thicker  easier to use formulation 
this product line extension  approved by the fda in january  allows for more precise application without the rundown experienced with the less viscous versions 
also  during  we further enhanced the design of the dermabond delivery system by introducing propen and propen xl  which were launched in both the us and europe in january band aid brand liquid bandage continued to provide significant revenue growth in just its second year of availability in the us consistent with the initial launch in  cpc executed a print and television advertising campaign during the summer months to increase consumer awareness of the liquid bandage 
cpc expanded distribution into foreign markets during when it introduced the liquid bandage product in canada in early and later in the year in europe 
during the year  we completed the development of the first line extension of our consumer technology with the introduction of the band aid brand liquid bandage skin crack 
this product was launched by cpc during january during  we continued the development of our internal adhesives  particularly the vascular sealant product 
we filed an investigational device exemption with the fda in june  and completed enrollment of a ten patient human pilot study in december 
this was a milestone for closure as this was the first time our technology has been used inside the human body 
we anticipate initiating a definitive clinical study in the first half of given positive results from the human pilot follow up with the fda 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
total revenues for were  compared to  for product revenues increased by primarily due to sales of our dermabond adhesive and band aid brand liquid bandage products 
dermabond adhesive  which included the introduction of the high viscosity product during  continued to represent the majority of total revenues 
however  the band aid brand liquid bandage product experienced significant year over year revenue growth  with the majority of this growth occurring during the first half of the year as cpc was gearing up for the summer bandage season  while the second half of was supported by the initial international shipments of liquid bandage 
cpc introduced the liquid bandage product in canada in early and then later in the year in europe 
in and  and of product sales were to one customer  respectively 
during  we anticipate continued revenue growth as our dermabond and band aid brand liquid bandage product lines continue to increase their market penetration  in particular the propen products and liquid bandage skin crack gel  each of which were launched in january in addition  we believe another factor in our anticipated revenue growth could be the fact that we receive a higher percentage of the ultimate selling price of each unit of our propen product as compared to the original dermabond and high viscosity products 
however  we will recognize a one time reduction of revenue in the amount of  in the first quarter of for incentive payments made by closure to ethicon 
these incentive payments are being made to resolve issues related to the payment provisions of the supply and distribution agreement for the dermabond product and to maintain goodwill and the positive relationship between the companies 
cost of products sold 
cost of products sold for was  compared to  for cost of products sold as a percentage of revenues was approximately for and for the improvement during was the result of higher production volumes coupled with manufacturing efficiency initiatives  including an increased scale of production and the addition of automated filling process for the liquid bandage product 
we expect that future gross margin percentages on product sales will fluctuate based on production volumes and the relative proportion of professional products versus otc products  which generally exhibit lower gross margin percentages 
with regard to our propen products  despite the fact that we receive a higher percentage of the ultimate selling price of each unit of propen product as compared to the original dermabond and high viscosity products  we do not expect this to have a significant impact on our overall gross margin percentages during because it costs us more to produce the propen products than the other dermabond products 
operating expenses 
operating expenses were approximately  and  for and  respectively 
operating expenses consist of research  development and regulatory affairs expenses and general and administrative expenses 
during  research  development and regulatory affairs expenses increased primarily due to efforts surrounding the development and validation of our new propen and propen xl products  the development of an internal vascular sealant and the related pilot study  as well as the development of line extensions for current products 
during  research  development and regulatory affairs expenses represented approximately of total revenues compared to in we expect these expenses will increase as we expand our product pipeline and related development efforts and clinical trials for potential new products  in particular our internal surgical sealants 
general and administrative expenses decreased in primarily due to a charge during of approximately  related to the transition of our ceo position 
overall  marketing personnel and insurance costs increased during general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased from in the period to in the period 

table of contents interest income  net 
net interest income for decreased slightly to  from  for total interest income decreased despite an overall increase in total investments and was primarily due to lower investment yields as a result of market interest rate changes during in addition  interest expense was minimal due to the extinguishment of our term loan balance during the first half of income taxes 
the provision for income taxes was  during compared to a benefit from income taxes of  during in  we began recording fully taxed earnings at an effective rate of approximately 
although we record a provision for income taxes on our statement of operations  we will not be required to pay federal income taxes  other than alternative minimum taxes  until such time as our net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards  approximately  and  respectively as of december   are exhausted 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
total revenues for were  compared to  for product revenues increased by which was primarily due to sales of band aid brand liquid bandage  launched in april by cpc as well as increased shipments of dermabond adhesive 
in  dermabond adhesive continued to represent the majority of total revenues  approximately 
license and product development revenues increased during to  from  in as revenue previously deferred was recognized ratably over the lives of various contracts with our marketing partners 
in and  and of product sales were to one customer  respectively 
cost of products sold 
cost of products sold for was  compared to  for cost of products sold as a percentage of revenues was approximately for and for the decrease was attributable to increased production volumes and cost containment 
also  our product sales mix continued to be heavily weighted with the dermabond product  which had significantly higher margins than our over the counter products 
operating expenses 
operating expenses were approximately  and  for and  respectively 
operating expenses consisted of research  development and regulatory affairs expenses and general and administrative expenses 
during  research  development and regulatory affairs expenses were primarily focused on the development of dermabond adhesive line extensions  including the high viscosity clinical study  the development of an internal vascular sealant and wound management products and basic research 
overall  general and administrative expenses increased in primarily due to a charge of approximately  related to the transition of the ceo position 
the charge included approximately  related to transition services provided by our former ceo and his entering into a non competition agreement 
the remainder primarily related to the taxes and benefits on the transition services and recruitment costs associated with the selection of a new ceo 
in addition  general and administrative costs for increased due to additional outside professional services and personnel costs over the period 
interest income  net 
net interest income for decreased to  from  for total interest income decreased primarily due to lower investment yields as a result of market interest rate changes during interest expense also declined due to the continued reduction of our term loan balance and capital lease obligations through monthly principal payments coupled with a decline in interest rates associated with those obligations 
all capital lease obligations were retired during income taxes 
prior to  no deferred provision or benefit for income taxes was recorded because we were in a net deferred tax asset position and a full valuation allowance had been recorded 
during the fourth quarter of  we re evaluated the amount of valuation allowance required in light of numerous factors including the profitability achieved in recent years and expected in future years 
as a result  we reduced the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets to an amount that we believe is more likely than not of being realized based on our assessment of the likelihood of near term operating income coupled with uncertainties with respect to the impact of future market conditions 
at december   the valuation allowance primarily reflects uncertainties involving the realization of state tax credits and loss carryforwards 
the valuation allowance was reduced by  during  including  related to net operating losses generated by the exercise of stock options prior to this portion of the reduction in the valuation allowance  along with  in similar tax benefits from stock option exercises during  was credited to additional paid in capital 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations to date primarily through the sale of equity securities  borrowings from lenders  license and product development revenues and product sales 
our principal sources of liquidity include cash  cash equivalents and marketable investments  which totaled  at december  as of december   we had no long term debt or capital lease obligations 
closure maintains a  line of credit for working capital purposes which had no borrowings under it at december  we currently have no commitments for any additional financing 
contractual obligations consist of operating leases and capital asset commitments 
operating leases obligations primarily relate to our facility lease 
purchase obligations represent noncancellable commitments for capital asset investments 
in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations as of december  total less than year years years more than years long term debt capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities capital expenditures there are no individually material capital expenditure commitments outstanding as of december  however  we estimate that capital investments for could be up to  to support facility expansion and additional manufacturing initiatives 
we believe that our balances of cash  cash equivalents  and investments together with funds generated from operations and existing borrowing facilities will be sufficient to meet our operating cash requirements and fund required capital expenditures for the foreseeable future 
research and development during  closure incurred approximately  in research  development and regulatory affairs expenses compared to  in the increase was primarily due to the development and validation of our new propen products  the development of an internal vascular sealant and the related pilot study  as well as the development of line extensions for current products 
we continued to increase our research and development activities to maintain a competitive advantage and we anticipate that research and development expenses will increase for the next several years as we develop new products and line extensions for existing products 
we also expect that clinical trials related to new products and line extensions will be costly and represent a significant part of future expenses 
research and development costs are expensed as incurred and include items related to personnel  costs of supplies  clinical trials  facility costs and fees paid to consultants and outside contractors and providers 
we have arrangements with certain marketing partners in which we share certain research  development and regulatory affairs expenses related to approved projects 
during  and  we were reimbursed   and  respectively  in accordance with these cost sharing arrangements 
we cannot estimate the costs to complete our research and development projects due to uncertainties regarding successful completion of projects  clinical trial outcomes and regulatory approvals 
we believe that funds for future research and development needs can be obtained from existing cash and investment balances and from cash generated from operations 
however  no assurance can be given that we may not require additional funds to support the completion of new product development  conduct clinical trials and obtain regulatory approvals 

table of contents cash flows net cash provided by operating activities was  for compared to  for the increase in cash provided by operations was primarily due to the increase in operating income during the period as well as the use of net operating loss carryforwards to reduce tax payments 
net cash used by investing activities was  during and  during the period 
the increase in net cash used during primarily related to an increased net investment in marketable securities and purchases of fixed assets supporting the manufacture of new products and our facility expansion 
net cash provided by financing activities was  during compared to net cash used during of  our primary financing activity during was related to the issuance of shares under the stock option and stock purchase plans 
based on our current plans  we believe that existing cash  cash equivalents and investments  which totaled  at december   will be sufficient to finance our operating and capital requirements for at least to months 
we anticipate that our recurring operating expenses will increase for the next several years  as we expect research  development and regulatory affairs and general and administrative expenses to increase in order to develop new products  manufacture in commercial quantities and fund additional clinical trials 
we also may invest in long term assets such as intangible assets and capital expenditures to expand our manufacturing capabilities 
our future capital requirements  however  will depend on numerous factors  including but not limited to the following our ability to manufacture and commercialize successfully our existing products  including dermabond adhesive and liquid bandage  the progress of our research and product development programs for future nonabsorbable and internal adhesive products  including clinical studies  the effectiveness of product commercialization activities and marketing agreements for our future products  including the scale up of manufacturing capabilities for increased capacity in anticipation of product commercialization and development  our ability to maintain existing marketing agreements  including our agreements with ethicon and cpc for dermabond adhesive and liquid bandage  respectively  and establish and maintain new marketing agreements  our ability to achieve product development milestones  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing intellectual property rights  the effect of competing technological and market developments  timely receipt of regulatory clearances and approvals and the costs of complying with regulatory requirements  general acceptance of our products by the medical community and consumers  and general economic conditions 
we may be required to seek additional capital to finance our operations in the future 
if our currently available funds and internally generated cash flow are not sufficient to satisfy our financing and operating needs  we will be required to seek additional funding through bank borrowings  additional public or private sales of our securities  including equity securities  or through other arrangements with marketing partners 
other than our working capital line of credit  we have no credit facility or other committed sources of capital 
there can be no assurance that additional funds  if required  will be available to us on favorable terms  if at all 
critical accounting estimates this is not a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the financial statements included in item of this form k 
the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  our management re evaluates its estimates and judgments 
we believe the following financial statement items require the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements 

table of contents intangible assets 
intangible assets are capitalized until either the related patent or license is issued or obtained  in which case they are amortized over the shorter of their remaining economic or useful lives or they are rejected or abandoned  in which case they are written off 
management estimates the remaining economic or useful life based on the subject matter protected  scope of the claims  the competitive barrier function and economic benefit 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate the adequacy of our patents and licenses carrying values in relation to estimated future cash flows and market trends exhibited by the related products 
if estimates made by management related to useful lives of intangible assets prove to be incorrect  our results could be effected by the change in amounts amortized each period 
inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
closure evaluates its inventory for obsolescence on an ongoing basis 
management reviews market trends exhibited by our products and sales forecasts to determine products subject to obsolescence 
if marketing conditions or customer requirements change and are less favorable than those projected by management  the realizable value of inventory may be overstated 
income taxes 
income taxes are computed using the asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
in estimating future tax consequences  we generally consider all expected future events other than enactment of changes in tax law or rates 
a valuation allowance is recorded when based on available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
on a quarterly basis  we consider all positive and negative evidence  including our earnings history and existing contracts and partnerships  to determine whether it is more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets will be realized in the future 
at december   closure had  recorded as deferred tax assets  primarily related to net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
if our estimates are incorrect  the realizable value of deferred tax assets may be overstated 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate sensitivity we are subject to interest rate risk on our investment portfolio which consists primarily of high quality short term money market funds  commercial paper  corporate bonds and other investments with an average maturity of less than one year 
we mitigate default risk by investing in what we believe are safe and high credit quality securities and by monitoring the credit rating of investment issuers 
the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity and there are limitations regarding average and individual duration of investments 
these available for sale securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase 
at december   our total portfolio consisted of approximately  of cash  cash equivalents and investments  the majority of which had average maturities within one year 
additionally  we generally have the ability to hold fixed income investments to maturity 
therefore  we do not expect our results of operations or cash flows to be materially affected due to a sudden change in interest rates 
foreign currency exchange risk our international sales and related royalties of dermabond adhesive and international sales of nexaband adhesives are based on sales in foreign currencies 
however  all of our sales to customers are payable in us dollars and we may be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
additionally  fluctuations in currency exchange rates may adversely affect demand for our products by increasing the price of our products in the currency of the countries in which the products are sold
