item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  and the notes thereto  presented elsewhere in this form k 
the operating results for the week periods ended january   january   and january  are based on the composition of restaurant operations as discussed in item selected financial data 
the implementation of the company s acquisition and strategic alliance strategies  and the costs associated with integrating new  under performing or unprofitable restaurants  acquired or otherwise operated by the company may affect the comparability of future periods and have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
we conduct business in the buffet segment of the restaurant industry and the operating performance of our restaurants is directly and heavily influenced by the overall state of the national and local economies where our restaurants are located 
when overall economic conditions negatively impact the financial performance of an individual restaurant  we periodically consider all the factors influencing that restaurant  such as operational efficiencies  local demographic changes  local construction activity  competition and other related factors 
we then assess the prospect that we can improve both the short term and long term financial results  at least to a level sufficient to recover our investment in the leasehold improvements and equipment assets 
there have been and likely will continue to be situations where we will make the decision that an asset is impaired and a write down in required

management estimates the cost of acquiring and converting one leased property to one of the existing concepts to be approximately  to  these costs consist primarily of exterior and interior appearance modifications  new tables  chairs and food bars and the addition of certain kitchen and food service equipment

impact of inflation management recognizes that inflation has an impact on food  construction  labor and benefit costs  all of which can significantly affect the company s operations 
historically  the company has been able to pass any associated higher costs due to these inflationary factors along to its customers because those factors have impacted nearly all restaurant companies 
however  management has emphasized cost controls rather than price increases given the competitive pressure within the quick service restaurant industry 
critical accounting policies and judgments the company prepares its consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the company s consolidated financial statements are based on the application of certain accounting policies  the most significant of which are described in note summary of significant accounting policies 
certain of these policies require numerous estimates and strategic or economic assumptions that may prove inaccurate or subject to variations and may significantly affect the company s reported results and financial position for the period or in future periods 
changes in underlying factors  assumptions or estimates in any of these areas could have a material impact on the company s future financial condition and results of operations 
the company considers the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing its consolidated financial statements 
property  buildings and equipment property and equipment and real property under capitalized leases are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization are provided using the straight line method over the following useful lives years buildings building improvements furniture  fixtures and equipment leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the life of the lease or estimated economic life of the assets 
the life of the lease includes renewal options determined by management at lease inception for which failure to renew options would result in a substantial economic penalty 
repairs and maintenance are charged to operations as incurred 
remodeling costs are generally capitalized 
the company s accounting policies regarding buildings and equipment include certain management judgments regarding the estimated useful lives of such assets  the residual values to which the assets are depreciated and the determination as to what constitutes increasing the life of existing assets 
these judgments and estimates may produce materially different amounts of depreciation and amortization expense that would be reported if different assumptions were used 
as discussed further below  these judgments may also impact the company s need to recognize an impairment charge on the carrying amount of these assets as the cash flows associated with the assets are realized 
impairment of goodwill goodwill and other intangible assets primarily represent the excess of the purchase price paid over the fair value of the net assets acquired in connection with business acquisitions 
as of january   the company adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
in accordance with sfas  the company has ceased amortizing goodwill recorded in past business combinations effective as of january  as a result  there is no charge for goodwill amortization expense contained in the company s statements of operations for the years ended january  and january   whereas the company s statements of operations for the year ended january  do contain charges for goodwill amortization expense 
sfas required that goodwill initially be tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of goodwill on a reporting unit basis to the carrying amount of the goodwill as of january  the company performed the transitional impairment test and determined that the carrying amount of goodwill was in excess of the fair value of the company s net assets 
this has resulted in a transitional impairment loss of  which has been reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle net of a tax benefit of  reported in the first quarter of the company evaluates goodwill for impairment each quarter 
impairment of long lived assets the company determines that an impairment write down is necessary for locations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceed the fair value of the assets 
judgments made by the company related to the expected useful lives of long lived assets and the ability of the company to realize undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of such assets are affected by factors such as the ongoing maintenance and improvements of the assets  changes in economic conditions  and changes in operating performance 
as the company assesses the ongoing expected cash flows and carrying amounts of its long lived assets  these factors could cause the company to realize a material impairment charge 
insurance programs the company is self insured for general liability claims 
the company has commercial insurance for casualty claims in excess of million per claim and million per year as a risk reduction strategy 
self insurance accruals include estimates based on historical information and expected future development factors 
differences in estimates and assumptions could result in accrual requirements materially different from the calculated accruals

the company does not have any pensions or other post retirement benefits 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
revised december  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
fin 
fin replaces the earlier version of this interpretation issued in january fin addresses the consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities as defined 
application of fin is required in financial statements of public entities that have interests in variable interest entities or potential variable interest entities commonly referred to as special purpose entities for periods ending after december  application of fin to all other types of entities is required in financial statements for periods ending after march  with earlier application permitted if the original interpretation was previously adopted 
the company adopted the original interpretation and fin as of january  which did not have a material effect on the company s financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the company s principal exposure to financial market risks is the impact that interest rate changes could have on its million revolving line of credit  of which  remained outstanding as of april  the revolving line of credit interest rate is libor plus two percent per annum averaging approximately in fiscal 
a hypothetical increase of basis points in short term interest rates would result in a reduction of approximately  in annual pre tax earnings 
the estimated reduction is based upon the outstanding balance of the company s line of credit and assumes no change in the volume  index or composition of debt at april  the balance outstanding on the revolving line of credit at january  is  all of our business is transacted in us dollars 
accordingly  foreign exchange rate fluctuations have never had a significant impact on the company and are not expected to in the foreseeable future 
commodity price risk the company purchases certain products which are affected by commodity prices and are  therefore  subject to price volatility caused by weather  market conditions and other factors which are not considered predictable or within our control 
although many of the products purchased are subject to changes in commodity prices  certain purchasing contracts or pricing arrangements contain risk management techniques designed to minimize price volatility 
typically the company uses these types of purchasing techniques to control costs as an alternative to directly managing financial instruments to hedge commodity prices 
in many cases  the company believes it will be able to address commodity cost increases which are significant and appear to be long term in nature by adjusting its menu pricing  menu mix or changing our product delivery strategy 
however  increases in commodity prices could result in lower operating margins for our restaurant concepts
