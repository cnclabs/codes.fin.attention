overview cap rock energy corporation is an electric distribution company operating in various non contiguous areas in the state of texas 
the company provides service to over  meters in counties covering approximately  square miles in texas 
this includes  meters within two operating divisions in the midland stanton area of west texas   meters in the central texas area around brady  and over  meters in northeast texas in hunt  collin and fannin counties 
the company also provides management services to the farmersville municipal electric system which services nearly  meters in farmersville  texas 
the company purchases power from wholesale suppliers and distributes that power to its retail customers over transmission lines covering over miles and then over  miles of distribution lines 
the company has not and does not plan to engage in the generation of electricity 
the company s primary focus is on the distribution of electricity to its customers 
in  the company purchased all electric power pursuant to wholesale electric power contracts with three suppliers 
generally  the wholesale electric power supply contracts are based on fixed charges for kwh usage  transportation and auxiliary services and a variable charge for fuel based on kwh usage 
the company s purchased power costs fluctuate primarily with the price of fuel used to generate that electricity  which is primarily natural gas and coal 
however  all costs associated with purchased power are passed through to the retail customer 
effective september   the company became subject to the oversight authority of the puct  and the rates and fees charged to customers by the company are now subject to puct approval 
in accordance with this change  the company immediately filed its tariff for electric service with the puct 
the company was required to submit a standard rate filing package to the puct in late february  in connection with the puct s review of the reasonableness of the company s rates  and its request for a rate increase for some customer classes 
because some parties have intervened in the process  management believes the proceedings will take a longer period of time  require dedication of more resources and ultimately cost the customer more 
the company is focused on being compliant with any rate case proceeding  but is concerned about the short and long term effects on its resources if the intervenors requests are voluminous and burdensome 
in its sustained efforts to divest itself of nonutility assets  the company reached an agreement with map to sell its shares of stock in exchange for a note receivable of  due in october although the investment appreciated over the period that the company held it  the sales price was less than recorded book value  and the company was required to record a loss on the sale of  upon receipt of the proceeds from the note receivable  the company will have recouped its original cash investment 
at september   the company had a note payable to a bank for  which was cross collateralized by notes receivable from united fuel and energy corporation united fuel in the same amount 
in october  united fuel consummated financing with a lender that provided for funds to partially pay down the company s note payable to a bank  with united fuel taking the position as borrower on the company s note payable to a bank  thus extinguishing united fuel s note receivable to the company 
the company is no longer a borrower and its involvement has been reduced to being a secondary guarantor for united fuel s note of  fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  requires the company to record a guarantee obligation that is measured at fair value 
the company s calculation of fair value included factors such as being a secondary guarantor and the collateralization of united fuel s assets 
the company has calculated its exposure and recorded a guarantee obligation of  in october upon united fuel s repayment of the note and the bank s release of the guaranty  scheduled for october  the company will be able to eliminate the recorded obligation 
in march  the company signed an agreement with a shareholder of united fuel to sell its shares of stock at a sales price of  consummation of the sale is contingent upon certain future events  such as united fuel s capitalization arrangements 
it is unknown when those events will transpire 
the board of directors adopted a resolution changing the date of the company s and the cooperative s fiscal year end from march to december  effective for the year ended december  critical accounting policies and estimates the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
certain of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
by their nature  these judgments and estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
these judgments and estimates are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  our observance of trends in the industry  information provided by our customers  and information available from other outside sources as appropriate 
different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period  or changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  that could have a material impact on the presentation of the company s financial condition  changes in financial condition or results of operations 
management believes that the following financial estimates are both important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and require subjective or complex judgments 
further  it is believed that the items discussed below are properly recorded in the financial statements for all periods presented 
management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of the most critical financial estimates with the board of directors audit committee 
the company s most critical accounting policy involves rate regulation 
the company is subject to the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas statement no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation 
in certain circumstances  sfas no 
requires that certain costs and or obligations be deferred on the balance sheet until matching revenues are recognized  subject to regulatory approval 
it is the company s policy to assess the recoverability of costs recognized as regulatory assets in accordance with sfas no 
 based on each regulatory action and the criteria set forth in sfas no 
any disallowance of these deferred costs would be charged against income immediately upon that disallowance 
power cost recovery factor 
the power cost recovery factor is the difference between the cost of power purchased and the cost of power recovered from the customers  divided by the number of kilowatt hours billed during the period 
power purchased includes transmission costs and wheeling charges 
this factor is estimated each month to recover actual power costs and is added as a surcharge to the base rate 
the factor is based on estimates of power cost increases decreases due to changes in fuel cost  usage and other cost fluctuations 
the estimate is adjusted in the subsequent month as compared to actual activity 
the company currently defers the difference between actual purchased cost and billed cost as a regulatory asset or liability 
the regulatory asset or liability  as well as the deferral  are adjusted in the next period by either receipt from  or refund to  the customer the net deferred amount 
derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the company enters into derivative transactions to manage the cost of natural gas as the fuel component of power cost 
as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  the pricing under the company s various power contracts varies with fuel cost  which is generally determined by the cost of natural gas 
these transactions minimize the fluctuations in their customers power bills 
the instruments are measured at fair market value and recorded as an asset or liability with a corresponding regulatory asset or liability 
changes in the fair value are recognized in current earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
as of december   no derivative portfolio was held 
revenue recognition policy 
for all periods through december   the company and its predecessor  the cooperative  utilized the cycle billing method to recognize revenue  pursuant to the rate making policy as set by the board of directors 
the cycle billing method recognizes revenue on an as billed basis when the customer is billed and not on an accrual basis  which recognized revenue as the power is distributed to the customer 
by utilizing the as billed method  unbilled revenue was not recognized 
effective january   the company s board of directors changed the rate making policy to recognize unbilled revenue 
the company was then required to change accounting principles related to its revenue recognition method 
under the new rate making structure  the company recognizes revenue when power is distributed to the customer  rather than when the customer is billed 
stock based compensation 
effective january   the company adopted the fair value method of accounting for its employee stock incentive plan in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  transition and disclosure 
under the historical or retroactive transition method allowed by sfas no 
 the compensation expense for the year ended december   would not have been different had the fair value method been originally applied 
tax liabilities and valuation of deferred tax assets 
the company is required to assess the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets generated from net operating losses  and capital losses incurred on the sale of assets 
this assessment takes into consideration tax planning strategies within our control  including assumptions regarding the availability and character of future taxable income 
at december   we have recorded  of valuation allowances against net deferred tax assets for which the ultimate realization of the tax asset is mainly dependent on the availability of future taxable income and capital gains 
the ultimate amount of deferred tax assets realized could be materially different from that recorded  as impacted by changes in federal income tax laws and upon the generation of future capital gains to enable us to realize the related tax assets 
at december   we also had approximately  of net operating loss carryforwards that expire in through  and may be used to offset future taxable income 
we recorded valuation allowances against the deferred tax assets related to net operating losses 
this determination was based on our assessment that it is more likely than not that the company may not be able to realize these deferred assets during the carryforward period 
this assessment considered the forecast reversal of existing temporary differences and taxable income expected to be generated in the carryforward period 
impairment of long lived assets 
management reviews the carrying value of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying values may not be recoverable in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
unforeseen events and changes in conditions could indicate that these carrying values may not be recoverable and may therefore result in impairment charges 
an impairment loss is recognized only if the carrying amount of the long lived asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value 
the carrying amount of a long lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds its future undiscounted cash flows  and if required  fair value of long lived asset is written down to its fair value 
the determination of future cash flows  and if required  fair value of long lived asset is by its nature a highly subjective judgment 
fair value is determined by calculating the discounted future cash flows using a discount rate  third party contracted bids or appraisals performed by a qualified party 
significant judgments and assumptions are required in the forecast of future operating results used in the preparation of the long term estimated cash flows  including long term forecasts of the amounts and timing of overall market growth 
changes in these estimates could have a material effect on the assessment of our long lived assets 
postretirement healthcare benefits 
the company provides certain postretirement healthcare benefits to employees and retirees 
determining the costs associated with such benefit is dependent on various actuarial assumptions including demographics age  sex  mortality rates  discount rates used in determining the projected benefit obligations  and current and projected health care cost trend rates 
independent actuaries perform the required calculations  in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
actual results that differ from the actuarial assumptions are generally accumulated and amortized over future periods 
results of operations year ended december  nine months ended december  successor successor predecessor predecessor unaudited thousands of dollars operating revenues electric sales other total operating revenues the consumption and demand for electricity within the company s service areas is greatly impacted by weather conditions and temperatures 
the hot temperatures during the summer months  or the third quarter  require residential customers to use more electricity in cooling their homes 
rural customers who irrigate crops use more electricity in the summer months for the irrigation process  and if the spring season didn t bring much rain  these customers may irrigate sooner and longer 
portions of the company s service areas have been experiencing a severe long term drought 
the national weather service climate prediction center shows only minimal relief for the ensuing year 
electric revenues increased  for as compared to this rise is due to multiple factors adjustments of  for recovery of increased power costs from prior periods were billed to customers  a regulatory surcharge of  was billed to customers  which related to intervention costs  a change in accounting principle  described in note to the consolidated financial statements  from the as billed method to the accrual method  increased electric revenues by  the regulatory surcharge  authorized by the company s board of directors  was intended to recover some of the expense incurred in connection with the company s response to opposing intervenors actions  and such surcharge has concluded 
the company had been realizing deferred revenue of  equally over a month period from january to december although this revenue is recognized equally in both the and periods  it has been fully billed through the power cost recovery factor  and will not be reflected in future periods 
this item related to purchased power expensed in prior years  but was recovered from customers over a month period 
this type of item may occur in the future because of the protocol mandated by ferc for administration of the transmission tariff 
see also note to the consolidated financial statements 
electric revenues for were  greater than those for because of the aforementioned recognition of deferred revenue related to recovery of power cost from prior periods  offset by a decrease in power cost recovery 
at the time of the company s conversion from an electric cooperative to an investor owned electric utility  the texas public utility regulatory act provided that a successor to an electric cooperative  such as the company  would be treated as a cooperative for regulatory purposes 
this would have allowed the board of directors of the company to continue to set the rates that it charges its customers 
in september  the company and the cooperative filed an application to transfer the cooperative s certificate of convenience and necessity to the company 
the ccn allows the cooperative and the company to serve electric customers in certain territories within the state of texas 
various intervenors challenged this transfer as well as the company s right to treatment as a cooperative for regulatory purposes under the pura 
following a contested proceeding  the pubic utility commission of texas approved the transfer of the ccn  effective september  however  during the legislative session  senate bill was adopted by the texas legislature which amended the pura so that the company would be treated as an investor owned utility subject to regulation by the puct 
the company s rates are now subject to regulation and approval by the puct  rather than the company s board of directors 
in accordance with this change in the pura  the company filed its electric service tariffs with the puct on september  the puct is currently reviewing those tariffs 
in addition  the puct initiated an inquiry to determine the reasonableness of the company s electric rates and required the company to submit a standard rate filing package 
the company submitted that rate filing package in late february the filing contained a request for a rate increase for the company s various customer classes  aggregating approximately 
the increase is intended to cover increased costs of service related to  among other things  property taxes  computer and it systems  and costs associated with being a regulated investor owned utility 
several parties have intervened in these proceedings requesting relief from the puc 
the major items being sought by the intervenors are that the company s rates be decreased and that the company be required to refund all monies it previously collected pursuant to a regulatory surcharge authorized by the board of directors during the company believes its rates are reasonable and that the requested rate increase is appropriate based upon its cost of service and reasonable return on its invested assets 
the puct has suspended the proposed rate increase pending a formal hearing and the company s current rates will remain in effect 
the company cannot determine what action the puct will take with respect to its current rates or its requested rate increase 
the pura requires the puct to rule on the rate request within a specified number of days and the company expects a final ruling in the fourth quarter of if the company s request for a rate increase is approved by the puct  the company may suffer a decline in consumption by customers 
because the outcome of the rate request or rate order is unknown  the company is unable to predict the effect of such order 
year ended december  nine months ended december  successor successor predecessor predecessor unaudited thousands of dollars operating expenses purchased power operations and maintenance general and administrative depreciation and amortization property taxes impairment of lamar combination costs other total operating expenses purchased power expense normally moves in relation to electric demand and consumption 
contract terms with wholesale power suppliers provide for pricing based upon the price of fuel  demand and usage 
all costs of power are passed through to the company s retail customers 
purchased power only increased  from to the net change is attributable to the change in accounting principle for unbilled revenues in  described in note to the consolidated financial statements  caused a catch up in the purchased power cost lag of  an increase of  in power costs offset by a decrease in net consumption  a decrease in wheeling charges of  a conclusion in september to the rate making treatment of the capital lease payments which were associated with the transmission system 
this caused a decrease of  the cost of natural gas has risen from to  which has increased the cost of purchased power and is passed directly through to customers 
management expects natural gas prices to remain flat for certain service areas of the company have experienced a rise in consumption  whereas other service areas reflect a decline in consumption 
the weather in the company s service area for as compared to has been milder the winter has been less severe  and the summer months didn t experience as many days over degrees 
purchased power cost decreased by  in due to high natural gas prices and fixed price contract losses during the early months of natural gas prices affect the cost of power generation  which is passed through from our power suppliers 
taking the aforementioned changes in into account  the nine month period ended december   was comparable in nature to as mentioned above  the rate making treatment of the transmission system capital lease payments concluded in september  as a result of final payment on the capital lease 
rate making treatment required the company to classify the amortization of property and equipment under the capital lease  as well as the associated interest expense  as purchased power 
total amounts included in purchased power which are associated with the capital lease are    and  for    and the nine months period ended december   respectively 
because the capital lease has been extinguished  this treatment is no longer applicable  and future periods will not reflect this expense 
the remaining net book value of the transmission system will be depreciated over its remaining life  and will be reflected in depreciation and amortization expense 
factors affecting operations and maintenance expense are certain weather conditions such as high winds  ice storms and lightning which cause damage to electric lines and interrupt service 
operations and maintenance increased  between and the majority of the change is related to an increased need in maintenance for the distribution and transmission systems which resulted in current expense  as opposed to engaging in construction activities that would have resulted in capitalized costs 
in april  each employee was granted a noncash stock award  with vesting over years 
officers  directors and certain retired directors were also granted noncash stock awards in july  with vesting periods ranging from to years 
the expense associated with these noncash awards is being amortized to expense over periods of to years 
this expense was allocated between operations and maintenance expense  and general and administrative expense  based upon the respective employee s or officer s function within the company 
for  the allocation of noncash compensation of  was  to operations and maintenance  and  to general and administrative 
expected noncash compensation expense by year is as follows     and  general and administrative expenses decreased by  between and the aforementioned noncash stock awards of  for were offset by decreases in legal and professional fees  the majority of which were associated with the puct proceedings concerning the application to transfer the cooperative s certified territory to the company  as well as decreases in public reporting costs 
the increase of  in general and administrative expense from to was primarily due to legal expenses associated with puct hearings  discussed previously  and shareholder related costs 
the company expects general and administrative expenses to increase in the future because compliance with puct rules and regulations  as well as the sarbanes oxley act of  will require more personnel 
depreciation and amortization increased  from the year ended as compared to for various reasons amortization of the fees and costs associated with the original transmission system capital lease were escalated by  in order that these costs would be fully amortized by the end of the lease term  increased depreciation expense of  associated with changes in estimated useful lives of certain general plant assets  initial amortization of  of the legal fees and costs incurred with respect to consummation of the beal bank loan  conclusion of the rate making treatment of the amortization of property and equipment associated with the transmission system capital lease caused an increase of  in connection with the original ten year capital lease associated with the transmission system  generally accepted accounting principles required the company to amortize the asset over a period consistent with the lease payments 
this period was much shorter than the estimated life of the asset  and the amortization was charged to purchased power 
because the capital lease was extinguished in september  and the rate making treatment is no longer applicable  the method of depreciation and life of the transmission system assets has changed to a straight line method with a year remaining life  and the expense is reflected in depreciation and amortization expense 
the company estimates the amount of such depreciation on the transmission system to be  per year 
in its efforts to be able to adapt to a changing regulatory environment  enhance efficiency  automate certain processes  position itself to pursue potential acquisitions and increase its customer base  management recognized the need for a more sophisticated and responsive it system and associated applications 
the company engaged an objective outside third party to assess the company s current and future it needs  assist in the selection process of software and related applications  implement the chosen products and processes and provide ongoing support 
the third party it company is also assisting the company in providing it internal control documentation and procedures in order that the company may begin the process of compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of certain it costs associated with the change in the operating environment  the applications and implementation process have been capitalized 
these costs  which aggregate  at december   will be amortized over years beginning march in addition  the ongoing costs for maintenance and it support is based on the number of meters and will approximate  per year through the term of the contract which is december all applications are anticipated to be operational by the end of although property tax expense has remained relatively constant for the past few years  the company anticipates property tax expense for will materially increase due to current appraisal methodologies used in the ad valorem taxation of investor owned utilities in texas 
estimates of the company s revenue generating ability are also considered in the appraisal process 
the company has increased its projection for property tax expense for from  to  as described more fully in note to the consolidated financial statements  in the company entered into an agreement to combine with lamar electric cooperative lamar 
lamar terminated the agreement in late although the company is seeking to recover the costs and expenses incurred in connection with the combination  generally accepted accounting principles required the impairment of those capitalized costs  which aggregated year ended december  nine months ended december  successor successor predecessor predecessor unaudited thousands of dollars other income expense allocation of income from associated organizations interest expense  net of capitalized interest interest and other income loss on sale of map stock equity earnings in map total other income expense although interest expense only decreased  from to  the major components changed 
because the company was able to lock in at some lower interest rates  coupled with a declining principal balance  interest expense on mortgage debt was reduced by  the cross collateralized note payable to a bank had a declining balance and was extinguished in september this was a change of  between and the draw on the initial advance in september from beal bank of per annum caused an increase of  interest expense decreased by  in from due to a decline in variable interest rates 
long term variable rates were in december compared to in december the rates on the  line of credit were and for december and december  respectively 
year ended december  nine months ended december  successor successor predecessor predecessor unaudited thousands of dollars income tax expense income tax expense for the year and nine months ended december   the company incurred no current income tax expense because it was able to utilize net operating loss carryforwards 
income tax expense increased  in and  in as of december   the company has net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million  which are scheduled to expire in through the company has benefited approximately million of net operating loss carryforwards because it has tax planning strategies available to realize the benefit of its tax loss carryforwards 
the irs has notified the company that it intends to examine the federal income tax return of the cooperative for the year because the cooperative is a nontaxable entity  and the company feels it filed a proper return  management believes that the outcome of the audit will not have a material effect on the company s financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
contractual obligations and other commitments the following table summarizes the company s obligations and commitments to make future payments under certain contractual obligations thereafter total thousands of dollars debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities total all of the company s power contracts are firm  full requirements contracts 
these types of contracts require the company to purchase all of its power needs from the seller  but do not mandate a minimum purchase amount 
therefore  amounts included for each year are basic required transmission charges 
also included are commitments for it services 
includes actuarially calculated amounts for post retirement healthcare costs of     and  for the years     and  respectively  as well as  for through also the company has a contract with the city of farmersville  texas  to provide power and assume related billing and collections functions 
the company is obligated to the city to make payments on a revenue sharing type basis 
the  and estimated  annual payments are  liquidity and capital resources as of december   the company had cash and cash equivalents of  current restricted cash investment of  working capital of  and long term indebtedness of  net of current portion 
the company requires capital to fund utility plant additions  working capital and other utility expenditures which are recovered in subsequent and future periods through rates 
capital necessary to meet these cash requirements is now derived primarily from internally generated funds 
through  one of the company s primary sources of capital and liquidity had been borrowings from cfc  the company s primary lender 
these borrowings are collateralized by substantially all of the company s utility distribution assets 
the existing long term debt consists of a series of loans from cfc that impose various restrictive covenants  including the prohibition of additional secured indebtedness  or the guaranty of such  and requires the maintenance of a debt service coverage ratio as defined in the cfc loan agreements 
in addition  the company may not make any cash distribution or any general cancellation or abatement of charges for electric energy or services to its customers if the ratio of equity to total assets is less than a stated percentage 
at december   the company was in compliance with its cfc loan agreements or had obtained waivers of certain covenants therein that the company was required to meet 
in december  the company elected to convert the interest rates on the majority of the mortgage notes from variable to fixed 
these lock ins of interest rates were done for one  two and three year periods 
substantially all of the cfc fixed rate notes are subject to interest rate repricing at the end of various periods  at the company s option 
interest rate repricing january amount fixed fixed fixed fixed fixed fixed total long term debt newcorp submitted an application to the federal energy regulatory commission in july  seeking authorization to borrow  from beal bank ssb beal bank 
ferc approval was received in august the arrangement with beal bank was segregated into two advances 
the initial advance provided proceeds of  for payment of the balloon payment on the transmission system capital lease  plus interest of  for a total of  the additional advance of  provides for  for working capital and cash reserves for operations and maintenance of the transmission system  purchase of transmission assets from cap rock energy corporation  repayment of a loan to another subsidiary  as well as payment of all costs and expenses associated with the new loan arrangement 
the new financing would also allow newcorp to make such system upgrades  improvements and expansions  as may be necessary 
the initial advance of  was completed in september simultaneously  the original lien on the transmission system was released and the sinking fund of  was transferred to a restricted securities account 
newcorp added  to the restricted securities account to bring the total restricted cash investment to  the amount of the initial advance proceeds 
this restricted cash investment is the only asset collateralized by beal bank in connection with the initial advance 
upon funding of the additional advance  the restricted cash investment would be released  and the transmission system  receivables and other assets related to the transmission system would be collateral for the full loan 
interest on the beal bank loan is the greater of per annum  or plus the one month libor rate  payable monthly 
the initial advance amount of  is due september   unless the additional advance is funded on or before that date  in which case  the entire principal amount would be payable monthly amortized over years 
pursuant to the terms of the financing arrangement  prepayment of the initial advance is not allowed before its scheduled maturity date  prepayment of the additional advance would not be allowed for the first months of the loan period  with a fee if prepayment was made during months through the financing arrangement also provided for a commitment fee of of the total loan amount with  payable for the initial advance  and the remaining  payable for the additional advance 
additional customary fees payable to beal bank were for reimbursement of expenses  attorney fees  appraisals and consulting 
total fees and costs incurred in connection with the beal bank advance through december   aggregated  maintenance of certain financial covenants would be required upon funding of the additional advance  and the company and newcorp are already in compliance with such future requirements 
the company would be required to maintain consolidated net worth of  and newcorp would be required to maintain a ratio of net income plus interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization to debt service of at least on a rolling quarter basis 
in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at december   the initial advance of  is shown in current liabilities because it is not certain that the company will draw on the additional advance from beal bank 
the company has other available options  which it may pursue  such as refinancing the debt with another lender  entering into a sale leaseback arrangement or selling the transmission system 
all of the options available to the company are contingent upon the transfer of newcorp s ccn 
see note  commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements 
whether the company draws on the additional advance with beal bank or another option is chosen  the restricted cash investment will be released at the same time 
if the company draws on the additional advance  the restricted cash investment of  would be released and available for use in operations  as well as new capital of  if the company pursues one of the other options  the restricted cash investment would be used to satisfy the initial advance of  shown in the table for under contractual obligations and other commitments 
when the regulatory process has been completed and the puct issues a final order concerning retail rates  the company may consider having a secondary common stock offering 
the offering could include the issuance of three to five million shares and would be used to reduce debt 
this would bring the debt to equity ratio to  which management believes is more in line with comparable electric utilities 
at that time  the company would also consider implementing a dividend policy 
one of the options offered to the cooperative s members in connection with the company s conversion from a cooperative to a shareholder owned corporation  was to receive their patronage capital in the form of credits on their utility bills ratably over a month period 
these credits were shown as liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets at december  and the month period ended november therefore  cash generated from customer payments of utility billings should increase by approximately  per year 
although the outcome concerning the puct s final order on the company s retail rates are unknown  with the current working capital position and the availability of other capital  management feels the company has adequate resources to meet its obligations for  including those enumerated in the table under contractual obligations and other commitments 
new accounting standards effective january   the company adopted sfas no
