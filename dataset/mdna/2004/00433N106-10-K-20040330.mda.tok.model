operational review for the year ended december  the year ended december  was very much a transitional year for us 
we implemented member escrow accounts during the fourth quarter of in response to the market changes in the healthcare savings industry  and on october   we expanded the escrow requirements to all programs offering access to medical doctors and physicians 
as a result of this change  we now require all of our members to escrow funds with us prior to utilizing any physician  hospital or ancillary services 
as of december   the percentage of our individual members who have escrowed funds with us was approximately  or of the total individual healthcare membership base 
this excludes our private label programs  where the escrow requirements have not been mandated 
our healthcare membership base was approximately  members as of december  as compared to  members as of december   a decrease of approximately  members or 
the reduction was most noticeable in the fourth quarter of where our membership decreased by approximately  or during this period 
the reduction in our healthcare membership base was primarily due to the implementation of the escrow account requirements for hospitalized care in the fourth quarter of  and expansion to physicians and doctors commencing on october  as a result of some of healthcare program changes introduced during and  our independent marketing representative base experienced a significant reduction in we  however  continue to maintain the majority of our core business leaders whose downline organizations generate a substantial portion of our revenues 
although these escrow requirements negatively impacted our membership base and consequently our revenues and net earnings in  these changes were required to help provide assurance of payment to the healthcare providers and accordingly  their continued willingness to provide healthcare services to our members 
this strategic move was critical to our long term operational and financial viability in the health card savings market as many healthcare providers throughout the united states will no longer accept a health discount card 
the success of our new healthcare product offering has not been fully determined 
therefore  its long term impact on both revenues and net earnings is currently unknown and may not be known until the third quarter of or later 
the growth of our members escrow or cash in trust from  as of december  to  as of december  provides preliminary although not conclusive evidence of the acceptance of this form of medical savings product offering 
in the fourth quarter of  we began reorganizing and rebuilding our corporate sales team to be better positioned to enter into the large self insured employer group and medical benefits market 
we restructured our in house sales team and in january hired a senior executive  vice president of sales and marketing to lead this area  both from a strategy and execution standpoint 
our medical savings product offering in conjunction with our care medical savings account provide an alternative healthcare product offering for a growing number of companies that have chosen to move towards the self funded and or high deductible insurance route 
this  along with the individual healthcare market  is a substantial portion of our overall business focus in critical accounting policies revenue recognition healthcare membership revenues we recognize membership revenues in the month the member joins the program 
membership revenues are reduced by the amount of refunds estimated to be incurred 
subsequent to the initial membership month  membership revenues are recognized on each monthly anniversary date 
member enrollment fees  net of direct costs  are deferred and amortized over the estimated membership period  that averages eight to ten months 
independent marketing representative fees  net of direct costs  are deferred and amortized over the term of the contract 
rental purchase and club membership revenues rental purchase and club membership revenues are recognized in the month that our products and services have been delivered to our clients 
we sell rental purchase and club membership programs on a wholesale basis to our clients 
the wholesale client remits a portion of the rental purchase and club membership revenues to us and retains the balance as compensation for having made the sale 
we provide an allowance for those accounts that we consider to be uncollectible 
commission expense commissions are paid to our independent marketing representatives in the month following the month in which a member has enrolled in our care entr e program 
commissions are only paid in the following month when the related monthly membership fees have been received 
we do not pay advanced commissions on membership sales 
goodwill valuation our goodwill of  as of december   represented the excess of acquisition costs over the fair value of net assets acquired

the goodwill balance of  as of december  consisted of  which arose from the merger acquisition of the capella group  inc and  from the acquisition of foresight  inc 
our goodwill valuation is dependent primarily on the projected revenue and net earnings of our care entr e healthcare and foresight  inc club membership business

in addition  effective october   the escrow account requirements for hospitalized care was expanded to include all medical doctors and physicians 
under the escrow arrangement  we now pre certify members ability to pay based on available escrow account balances and process the members payments directly to the medical providers to help assure the payment of the healthcare providers

the escrowed funds referred to as cash in trust on our balance sheet was  as of december  the reduction in revenue in our wholesale club membership programs was due to the maturity and competitive nature of this business as compared to our healthcare membership savings business which operates in a growth market
