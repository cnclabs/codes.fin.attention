item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary since  credit acceptance has provided auto loans to consumers  regardless of their credit history 
the company s product is offered through a nationwide network of automobile dealers who benefit by selling vehicles to consumers who otherwise could not obtain financing 
the company delivers credit approvals instantly through the internet 
the company s revenues are generated primarily through the servicing fees it receives for the collection and administration of loans assigned by dealer partners to the company  and to a lesser extent  through the fees it receives through the sale of third party ancillary products 
the company s strategy is to increase the amount of economic profit per share by increasing its return on capital and profitably growing its business 
see page for the company s definition of economic profit 
the company believes it has been successful in improving the returns on loan originations in recent years primarily as a result of increasing the spread between the forecasted collection rate and the advance rate 
loan originations grew in due to an increase in the number of active dealer partners  an increase in the number of loans per active dealer partner  and an increase in the average loan size 
since the company believes it is the only financial services company offering guaranteed credit approval for automobile dealers on a national scale  and the company presently serves only a small portion of its target market  the company believes that it has a good opportunity to grow its business profitably in the future 
critical success factors for the company include its access to capital and its ability to accurately forecast loan performance 
the company employs modest financial leverage with a funded debt to equity ratio of at december  the company funds its business through a revolving credit facility  a warehouse line of credit and privately placed asset backed financings 
the company s forecasts impact loan pricing and structure as well as the required allowance for credit losses 
the company manages its risk by managing the spread between the forecasted collection rate and the advance rate 
forecasting loan performance the following table presents forecasted collection rates  advance rates  the spread the forecasted collection rate less the advance rate  and the percentage of the forecasted collections that have been realized as of december  the amounts presented are expressed as a percent of the original loan amount by year of loan origination 
december  forecasted of forecast year collection advance spread realized the risk of a forecasting error declines as loans age 
for example  the risk of a material forecasting error for business written in is very small since of the total amount forecasted has already been realized 
in contrast  the company s forecast for recent loan originations is less certain 
if the company produces disappointing operating results  it will likely be because the company overestimated future loan performance 
a wider spread between the forecasted collection rate and the advance rate reduces the company s risk of credit losses 
because collections are applied to advances on an individual dealer partner basis  a wide spread does not eliminate the risk of losses  but it does reduce the risk significantly 
the company made no material changes in credit policy or pricing during  other than routine changes designed to maintain current profitability levels 
one method for evaluating the reasonableness of the company s forecast is to examine the trends in forecasted collection rates over time 
the following table compares the company s forecast as of december  with the forecast as of december  december  december  year forecasted collection forecasted collection variance the company first began publishing collection forecasts in its annual report 
forecasted collection rates declined in when a difficult collection system conversion negatively impacted collection results 
the unanticipated difficulties associated with the conversion resulted in a decreased number of phone calls placed per delinquent account  which resulted in a reduction in collection rates during the third and fourth quarters of during the fourth quarter  collection system performance improved and by the end of the quarter had returned to pre system conversion levels as measured by call volumes and charge off rates 
in the first quarter of  the company s collection forecast continued to decline when post repossession collection results known as deficiency balance collections deteriorated 
during the remainder of  forecasted collection rates stabilized 
accurately predicting future collection rates is critical to the company s success 
historically  the company has experienced an adverse change in the profitability of loan originations during periods of high growth 
while the growth rates experienced in the united states in are higher than the company s expected long term growth rate  the company believes that the investments in corporate support functions in  combined with decreases in loan origination volumes in  have adequately prepared the company for this growth 
the company intends to make every possible effort to assess collection rates as accurately as possible

critical accounting policies and loss experience the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to the allowance for credit losses  finance charge revenue  stock based compensation expense  impairment of various assets  contingencies  and taxes 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies involve a high degree of judgment and complexity  and the use of different estimates or assumptions could produce different financial results 
allowance for credit losses balance sheet caption allowance for credit losses income statement caption provision for credit losses nature of estimates required estimating losses inherent in the company s loan portfolio 
assumptions and approaches used the company maintains an allowance for credit losses at a level it considers to be adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in the company s loan portfolio 
the company compares the present value of estimated future collections for each dealer partner s loan portfolio to the company s net investment in that portfolio to record losses 
the estimate of future collections uses various assumptions based on a dealer partner s actual loss data on a static pool basis and the company s historical loss and collection experience 
forecasted collections are discounted to present value using a rate equal to the rate of return expected at the origination of the loan
