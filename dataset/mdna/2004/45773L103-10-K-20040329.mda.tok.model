item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and associated notes appearing elsewhere in this report 
overview we have developed  patented and licensed innovative technologies utilizing a magnetic based design for electronic switches 
we are currently expanding the use of these technologies by licensing manufacturers to produce and sell products using our technologies 
we believe these patented and patent pending technologies allow us and our licensees to provide innovative solutions to the design challenges faced by oems and component suppliers 
during  we started to implement our business model of licensing our technologies rather than manufacturing switches ourselves 
we completed this transition in june and expect substantially all of our future revenues to come from our licensing efforts 
as of march   we had licensees  foreign and domestic 
because the revenue generated from licensing switch technologies is lower than the revenue from manufacturing the same number of switches  we expected our net revenue to decrease during our transition to licensing 
concurrently  our gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased because the cost of goods sold associated with licensing is much lower than with manufacturing 
we anticipate that licensing revenue will fluctuate from period to period 
it will be difficult for us to predict the timing and magnitude of such revenue  as it depends on the licensees ability to market  produce and ship products that incorporate our technologies 
we believe that the amount of licensing revenue for any period is not necessarily indicative of results for any future period 
our research  development and commercial application engineering expenses are comprised mainly of personnel and occupancy costs 
our selling  general and administrative expenses are comprised mainly of personnel costs  depreciation  and occupancy costs 
during the second quarter of  we completed the transition to a licensing business model away from switch manufacturing and  as a result  the relationship between net revenue  cost of goods sold  and operating expenses reflected in our financial information may not represent future expected financial relationships 
application of critical accounting policies we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations are discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations when such policies affect our reported or expected financial results 
in the ordinary course of business  we have made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of results of operations and financial condition in the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
the results form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require our most difficult  subjective  and complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition 
we enter into licensing agreements with our customers 
our licensing strategy incorporates a simplified requirement whereby the licensee purchases licensed components from us 
the purchase price of the licensed components includes the royalty fee 
when the components are shipped  we recognize licensing revenue and licensing cost 
table of contents of goods sold 
in some cases where no licensed components are supplied  we are paid a royalty per switch manufactured by the licensee and we recognize revenue in the period the switch is manufactured 
in the case of the delphi minimum royalty payments  we recognize revenue as it is earned either as delphi sells products incorporating our technologies  or in the event that the royalties earned on the sale of delphi products is less than the minimum royalty payment  we recognize the difference between royalties previously recognized and the minimum royalty payment as revenue on june of each applicable year 
some of our licensees have prepaid royalties to us pursuant to their license agreements 
these prepayments are recorded as deferred revenue 
this deferred revenue is recognized as licensing revenue when earned under the licensing agreement 
if a licensee purchases a licensed component from us  the royalty is earned when the licensed component is shipped 
if the licensee is directly manufacturing our switches without purchasing licensed components from us  we consider the royalty earned when the switch is manufactured 
in the case of our exclusive license agreement with delphi  the up front payment is nonrefundable and the portion of the million payment allocated to deferred revenue is being amortized over the initial seven year term of the agreement 
see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
inventory valuation 
our inventory is primarily comprised of licensed components  which are sold to licensees 
we state inventories at the lower of cost or market value  determined using the first in  first out method 
our policy is to write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory to the extent the cost exceeds the estimated market value 
we base the estimate on our assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those assumed in our estimates  additional inventory write downs might be required 
we reflect any write down of inventory in the period in which the facts giving rise to the inventory write down become known to us 
impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we review our long lived assets and identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
additionally  goodwill is reviewed on an annual basis 
our intangible assets are primarily our patents and the goodwill associated with the acquisition of aztec industries 
if such assets were considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized would be measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair market value of the assets 
we evaluate the recoverability of property and equipment and intangibles excluding goodwill not held for sale by comparing the carrying amount of the asset or group of assets against the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset or group of assets 
if the undiscounted estimated cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset or group of assets being reviewed  an impairment loss would be recorded 
the loss would be measured based on the estimated fair value of the asset or group of assets compared to its carrying value 
the estimated fair value would be based on the best information available under the circumstances  including prices for similar assets and the results of valuation techniques  including the present value of expected future cash flows using a discount rate commensurate with the risks involved 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of our company  which is the only reporting unit  with the carrying value  including goodwill 
the estimated fair value is based on the best information available under the circumstances  including quoted market prices in stock markets  valuation techniques based on earnings  or independent valuations 
if the fair value of our company exceeds the carrying amount  goodwill is not considered to be impaired 
if the carrying amount of our company exceeds our fair value  the fair value of the goodwill is calculated  and the excess of the carrying value of the goodwill over its fair value is recorded as an impairment loss 
to determine the fair value of goodwill  our fair value is allocated to all of our assets and liabilities  and any excess of fair value of our company over the fair value of our assets and liabilities is the estimated fair value of goodwill 
results of operations for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  net revenue 
we recorded net revenue of  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december   a decrease of  the decrease is due to the expected decrease in product revenue as a result of the completion of our transition from manufacturing to licensing switch technologies 
licensing revenue was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  an increase of  or 
our licensing revenue is primarily comprised of the recognition of revenue resulting from the recognition of deferred revenue from our license agreement with delphi and per switch revenue from non exclusive licensees who manufacture switches incorporating our technologies 
the per switch revenue includes royalties and revenue from the sale of licensed components 

table of contents to date  the majority of non exclusive licensing revenue has been related to our pushgate pushbutton technology 
the number of unit sales of royalty bearing pushgates has fluctuated during the last three years from approximately million in  to million in to million in the increase in units from to was primarily related to a sale of one million units to one licensee 
the decrease from to was primarily due to the sale of one million units to one licensee not being replicated in and was offset by increased unit sales to other licensees 
our license agreement with delphi generated licensing revenue of  or of our licensing revenue and total net revenue for the year ended december  and  or of our licensing revenue and of our total net revenue for the year ended december  licensing revenue from delphi primarily resulted from the recognition of deferred licensing revenue  which was recorded in delphi s license agreement also includes minimum royalty payments of million during through the first minimum royalty payment of million will be earned effective june  and is due july  the remaining installments are due as follows million july   million july   and million due july  product revenue was and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  a decrease of  the decrease reflects our transition to a technology licensing company 
the  of product revenue for the year ended december  was related to fees received for engineering services we had provided to a customer in prior periods that were in dispute 
we do not expect to have any significant product revenue in the future 
cost of goods sold 
total cost of goods sold and licensing cost of goods sold was  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december   a decrease of  the decrease in cost of goods sold and increase in gross profit as a percentage of revenue to in from in was primarily due to a charge to licensing cost of goods sold related to earlier versions of licensed components that will no longer be promoted and will only be considered as an alternative to our current licensed component inventories in limited circumstances 
there was no comparable charge in we anticipate that our gross profit as a percentage of revenue will fluctuate in future periods as we experience changes in the percentage of revenue generated from sales of licensed components  royalties from licensees who manufacture products utilizing our technologies without purchasing licensed components from us and the recognition of deferred revenue from our licensing agreement with delphi 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were  for  compared to  for  a decrease of  the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses was primarily related to personnel reductions 
we expect general and administrative expenses to decrease as we significantly reduced our ongoing occupancy costs on january  when we entered into a new long term building lease  saving approximately  annually 
additionally in  we will see the full year effect of our personnel reductions 
as revenue increases  additional commission expense will be incurred including a commission on cash received from delphi related to their license agreement 
research  development and commercial application engineering 
research  development and commercial application engineering expenses were  for  compared to  for  a decrease of  the decrease was primarily attributable to costs related to decreased research and development personnel 
in  we added personnel and increased our modeling and testing capabilities  resulting in increased costs 
as we entered  we began to reduce these expenses primarily by reducing research and development personnel 
in and  research and development expenses decreased each quarter from the preceding quarter 
we anticipate that research  development and commercial application engineering expenses will decrease due to reductions in occupancy costs  personnel  and depreciation 
in october  we announced cost cutting initiatives that included significant reductions in research and development personnel focused on new technologies 
in  we continued the cost cutting initiatives and made further personnel reductions 
as part of our reduced research and development activities  we entered into a new employment agreement with our co founder and chief technology officer 
the new agreement reduced his salary and time commitment to duraswitch by 
we have created a portfolio of patented and patent pending technologies  which are available through our licensees 
the efforts of our remaining personnel will continue to be directed at commercializing our technologies as opposed to also focusing on the creation of new technologies 
they will continue to support our licensees in their efforts to commercialize our existing patented and patent pending technologies 
loss from operations 
as a result of the decreases in selling  general and administrative expenses and research  development and commercial application engineering expenses  loss from operations decreased to  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december   a decrease of  other income net 
other income net was  for compared to  for  a decrease of  the decrease in other income net is due to the decrease in investment income as a result of lower interest rates 
table of contents and lower average cash balances and to the  loss recorded for the disposal of fixed assets 
net loss 
the decrease of  or in the net loss to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  was primarily a result of decreased selling  general and administrative expenses and decreased research and development expenses 
results of operations for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  net revenue 
we recorded net revenue of  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december   a decrease of  the decrease is due primarily to the expected decrease in product revenue as a result of the completion of our transition from manufacturing to licensing switch technologies and decreased licensing revenue resulting from a decrease in per switch royalties and a decrease in the per design review revenue 
licensing revenue was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  a decrease of  or 
our licensing revenue is primarily comprised of the recognition of revenue resulting from the recognition of deferred revenue from our license agreement with delphi and per switch revenue from non exclusive licensees who manufacture switches incorporating our technologies 
the per switch revenue includes royalties and revenue from the sale of licensed components 
to date  the majority of non exclusive licensing revenue has been related to our pushgate pushbutton technology 
the number of unit sales of royalty bearing pushgates has increased during the last three years from approximately one million in  million in  to million in revenue has not tracked this increase because the average revenue earned per pushgate during was just over  the low end of the range  compared to average per pushgate revenue of in the increase in the quantity of licensed components sold was primarily related to a sale of one million units to one licensee 
the decrease in the per switch royalties resulted from volume discounts 
licensing revenue was also impacted by a decrease in fees related to the review of customer designs 
the primary reason for the decrease in design review fees was a reduction of the amount billed per design review 
at the same time  we experienced an increase in the number of design reviews 
as contemplated in our license agreements  we have lowered these fees as our licensees have gained experience and become more proficient with our technologies as well as to remove barriers to commercial acceptance 
our license agreement with delphi generated licensing revenue of  or of our licensing revenue and of our total net revenue for the year ended december  and  or of our licensing revenue and of our total net revenue for the year ended december  licensing revenue from delphi primarily resulted from the recognition of deferred licensing revenue which was recorded in product revenue was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  a decrease of  the decrease reflects our transition to a technology licensing company 
the  of product revenue for the year ended december  was related to fees received for engineering services we had provided to a customer in prior periods that were in dispute 
we do not expect to have any significant product revenue in the future 
cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold was  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december   a decrease of  the decrease in cost of goods sold and the increase in gross profit as a percentage of revenue to in from in reflects our transition from the low margin business of manufacturing switch panels to the high margin business of licensing 
we anticipate that our gross profit as a percentage of revenue will fluctuate in future periods as we experience changes in the percentage of revenue generated from sales of licensed components  royalties from licensees who manufacture products utilizing our technologies without purchasing licensed components from us and the recognition of deferred revenue from our licensing agreement with delphi 
licensing cost of sales for was  compared to  in  an increase of  the increase in licensing cost of goods sold for the year ended december  was primarily due to a  charge to licensing cost of goods sold related to earlier versions of licensed components that will no longer be promoted and will only be considered as an alternative to our current licensed component inventories in limited circumstances 
this increase was offset by a reduction in our per unit cost of licensed components and decreased sales of other materials with low gross margins 
product cost of goods sold was in compared to  in  a decrease of  the decrease in product cost of goods sold was due to the completion of our transition to a licensing business model from a product based model 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were  for  compared to  for  a decrease of  selling  general and administrative expenses in included a charge of  related to costs associated with the resignation of our former chief executive officer 
no such charge was recorded in the remainder of the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses was primarily related to reductions in executive and support personnel 
research  development and commercial application engineering 
research  development and commercial application engineering expenses were  for  compared to  for  a decrease of  the decrease was primarily attributable to costs related to decreased research and development personnel 
during  research and development expenses increased every quarter as we ramped up our research and development activities to expand our technology portfolio and develop various adaptations of our core technologies 
we added personnel and increased our modeling and testing capabilities  resulting in increased costs 
as we entered  we began to reduce these expenses primarily by reducing research and development personnel 
in  research and development expenses decreased each quarter from the preceding quarter 
loss from operations 
as a result of the decreases in selling  general and administrative expenses and research  development and commercial application engineering expenses  loss from operations decreased to  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december   a decreased loss of  other income net 
other income net was  for  compared to  for  a decrease of  the decrease in other income net is due to the decrease in investment income as a result of lower interest rates and lower average cash balances 
net loss 
the decrease of  or in the net loss to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  was primarily a result of decreased selling  general and administrative expenses and decreased research and development expenses  which were offset by the reduction in investment income 
liquidity and capital resources we had cash and cash equivalents of  on december  during the past three years  we have experienced decreases in our cash and cash equivalents primarily as a result of cash used in operations offset by the proceeds from the stock sales related to the exercise of employee stock options 
net cash used in operating activities during the year ended december  was  cash used in operating activities consisted primarily of the net loss  a decrease in deferred licensing revenue  and a decrease in accrued salaries and benefits that were all partially offset by depreciation and amortization 
net cash provided by investing activities during the year ended december  was  our net cash provided by investing activities consisted primarily of proceeds from the sale of equipment that had been used for research and development and for manufacturing marketing pieces 
the sale proceeds were partially offset by investments in patents 
net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended december  was  consisting primarily of net proceeds from the sale of stock related to the exercise of employee stock options  which was partially offset by principal payments on capital lease obligations 
our license agreement with delphi requires delphi to pay us minimum royalty payments totaling million during through the first million minimum royalty payment is earned effective june  and is due on july  subsequent payments are due as follows million on july   million on july   and million on july  delphi can maintain exclusivity for the automotive industry through june  by making additional minimum annual royalty payments during that period 
after june   either party may convert the agreement to a non exclusive agreement through at december   we had approximately million in net operating loss carryforwards available for federal and state income tax purposes 
we have not recognized any benefit from these operating loss carryforwards  which expire in through we have employment agreements with our executive officers 
these agreements call for a base salary and bonuses 
these agreements also provide for salary and benefits in the event of separation 
effective december  
table of contents our former chief executive officer resigned his position 
his employment agreement provided for salary and benefits in the event of termination or resignation 
as such  we recorded a charge of  during the year ended december  to be paid over an month period 
at december  the entire amount had been paid 
we have experienced significant operating losses since our inception 
during and we reduced our personnel to employees from at december  we entered into a new lease agreement on january  and significantly reduced our occupancy costs as we reduced our lease commitment from  square feet to  square feet 
as a result of these factors and other cost cutting initiatives we anticipate that our cash and working capital requirements will decrease in from historical levels 
however  our capital expenditures and working capital requirements could increase depending on our operating results and other adjustments to our operating plan as may be needed to respond to competition or unexpected events 
we believe that our cash on hand will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least months 
we continually evaluate our working capital needs and we may seek to obtain additional working capital through debt or equity offerings 
there can be no assurance that additional funds will be available on acceptable terms 
in the event that additional funds are not available on acceptable terms  we could be required to reduce the scope of or cease operations 
the following table sets forth our contractual obligations and commitments as of december  payments due by period less than contractual obligations year years thereafter total capital lease obligations including interest operating leases purchase order obligations total contractual cash obligations represents open commitments to acquire licensed components within the next twelve months 
represents the cost of tooling for volume production of pushgate island magnets which is being built to our specifications 
commitment will be reduced by each component part which is sold by the vendor 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as foreign currency exchange and interest rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments to manage these risks and do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
we are currently exposed to credit risk on credit extended to our licensees 
based on the credit worthiness of our licensee base and the relative size of these financial instruments  we believe the risk associated with these instruments will not have a material adverse affect on our business  financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
additionally  we are exposed to some market risk through interest rates related to our investment of cash and cash equivalents of approximately million 
the risk is not considered material and we manage such risk by evaluating the best investment rates available for short term high quality investments 
presently  all of our receivables and substantially all of our payments are denominated in us dollars and  consequently  we believe we have no foreign currency exchange rate risk 
however  in the future  we may enter into agreements in foreign currencies that may subject us to foreign exchange rate risk 
there can be no assurance that our future efforts to reduce foreign exchange risk will be successful
