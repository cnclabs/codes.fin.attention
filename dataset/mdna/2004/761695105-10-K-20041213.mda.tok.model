typically hardware  hardware installation and software training revenues ie one time revenues are billed upon shipment and recognized over the implementation period 
depending on their nature  software license fees may be billed upon shipment or bundled with monthly software support services

see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information of the company s revenue recognition policies 
although the company s primary customers are automotive retailers in the united states and canada  the company s financial performance is not necessarily correlated with the number of new vehicles sold by these retailers 
automotive retailers have other profit centers such as used vehicles  service and parts which provide a more consistent revenue stream and a greater proportion of a typical automotive retailer s income than provided by new vehicle sales 
this allows automotive retailers to invest in products and services that improve customer satisfaction and increase productivity 
the company earns most of its income from recurring software and hardware maintenance revenues 
about of the company s revenues are recurring in nature when documents and financial services are included 
additionally  much of professional services revenues tend to be recurring in nature as programs are continued each year
