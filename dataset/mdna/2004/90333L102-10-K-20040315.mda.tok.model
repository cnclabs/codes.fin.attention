item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations statements we make in the following discussion which express a belief  expectation or intention  as well as those that are not historical facts  are forward looking statements that are subject to various risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
our actual results  performance or achievements  or industry results  could differ materially from those we express in the following discussion as a result of a variety of factors  including the risks and uncertainties to which we refer to under the headings cautionary statement concerning forward looking statements following item of this report and factors that may affect our future operating results below 
overview we derive substantially all our revenues from the sale of ready mixed concrete  other concrete products and related construction materials to the construction industry in the united states 
we typically sell ready mixed concrete under purchase orders that require us to formulate  prepare and deliver the product to our customers job sites 
we recognize sales from these orders when we deliver the ordered products 
the principal states in which we operate are california of sales and of sales  new jersey of sales and of sales  michigan of sales and of sales and texas of sales and of sales 
we serve substantially all segments of the construction industry in our markets  and our customers include contractors for commercial and industrial  residential  street and highway and public works construction 
the percentage of our concrete product sales contributed in and from our customers was as follows residential commercial and industrial street and highway other public works the markets for our products generally are local  and our operating results are subject to swings in the level and product mix of construction activity that occur in our markets 
the level of activity affects the demand for our products  while the product mix of activity among the various segments of the construction industry affects both our relative competitive strengths and our operating margins 
although the residential construction market remained strong throughout  the nonresidential construction market continued to decline  reflecting the general state of the overall economy and employment in the united states 
this general decline in nonresidential construction  sustained adverse weather conditions in several of our markets for a portion of the year and the realignment of our businesses in our north texas operations had an adverse impact on our sales in we expect the nonresidential construction market to improve in our cost of goods sold consists principally of the costs we incur in obtaining the cement  aggregates and admixtures we combine to produce ready mixed concrete and other concrete products 
we obtain most of these materials from third parties and generally have only a few days supply at each of our plants 
these costs vary with our levels of production 
our cost of goods sold also includes labor  primarily for delivery professionals  and insurance costs and the operating  maintenance and rental expenses we incur in operating our plants  mixer trucks and other vehicles 
since our inception in  our growth strategy has contemplated acquisitions 
we purchased one business in and one business in  both of which we have accounted for in accordance with the purchase method of accounting 
the rate and extent to which appropriate further acquisition opportunities are available  and to the extent which acquired businesses are integrated and anticipated synergies and cost savings are achieved can affect our operations and results 

table of contents factors that may affect our future operating results cyclicality of construction industry activity 
demand for ready mixed concrete and other concrete products depends on the level of activity in the construction industry 
that industry is cyclical in nature  and the general condition of the economy and a variety of other factors beyond our control affect its level of activity 
these factors include  among others commercial vacancy and residential new home inventory levels  employment levels  consumer spending habits  the availability of funds for public or infrastructure construction  changes in interest rates  sustained adverse weather conditions  the availability of short and long term financing  and levels of inflation 
seasonality of construction industry activity 
reflecting the levels of construction activity  the demand for ready mixed concrete is highly seasonal 
our results for any individual quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year because seasonal changes and other weather related conditions can affect construction activity and  as a result  our sales and earnings 
normally  we attain the highest sales and earnings in the second and third quarters and the lowest sales and earnings in the first quarter 
for these reasons  you should not rely on quarterly comparisons of our revenues and operating results as indicators of our future performance or the results of any quarterly period during a year as an indicator of results you may expect for that entire year 
regional variability 
the economic and seasonal factors described above can affect various local and regional economies in different ways 
accordingly  the levels of construction activity at any given time can vary greatly across the country 
markets for our products generally are local and  therefore  our results of operations are susceptible to fluctuations in the levels of construction activity that may occur in our local markets 
product supply and demand 
generally  ready mixed concrete is price sensitive 
prices for our products are subject to changes in response to relatively minor fluctuations in supply and demand  general economic conditions and market conditions  all of which are beyond our control 
because of the fixed cost nature of our business  our overall profitability is sensitive to price changes and minor variations in sales volumes 
competition 
competitive conditions in our industry also may affect our future operating results 
financing 
we rely on third party financing to fund  in part  our working capital and capital expenditure needs  the internal expansion of our operations and our acquisition activities 
our new credit facility and our senior subordinated notes contain covenants that limit our ability to take certain actions with respect to our company and our businesses 
future financing arrangements likely will contain similar restrictions 
these restrictions on our activities may cause us to forego certain courses of action that we would otherwise choose to pursue 
product claims 
our operations generally involve providing concrete that must meet building code or other regulatory requirements and contractual specifications for durability  stress level capacity  weight bearing capacity and other characteristics 
we may incur material costs and losses as a result of claims that our products do not meet regulatory requirements or contractual specifications 

table of contents regulation 
we are subject to federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning  among other matters  air emissions and wastewater discharge 
we believe we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations 
from time to time  we receive claims from federal and state environmental regulatory agencies and entities asserting that we may be in violation of environmental laws and regulations 
on the basis of our experience and the information currently available  we believe these claims will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
despite compliance and experience  it is possible that we could be held liable for future charges that might be material  but are not currently known or estimable 
in addition  changes in federal or state laws  regulations or requirements  or discovery of currently unknown conditions  could require additional expenditures 
we reserved million for remediation costs in connection with the aggregates business we acquired in we currently do not expect the costs of that remediation to exceed that amount 
critical accounting estimates preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
note to our consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies we use in preparing those statements 
we believe the most complex and sensitive judgments  because of their significance to our financial statements  result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the most significant areas involving our management judgments and estimates are described below 
actual results in these areas could differ from our estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts we extend credit to customers and other parties in the normal course of business 
we regularly review outstanding receivables and provide for estimated losses on accounts receivable we believe we may not collect in full 
a provision for bad debt expense recorded to selling  general and administrative expenses increases the allowance and accounts receivable that we write off our books decrease the allowance 
we determine the amount of bad debt expense we record each period and the resulting adequacy of the allowance at the end of each period by using a combination of our historical loss experience  customer by customer analyses of our accounts receivable balances each period and subjective assessments of our bad debt exposure 
the allowance for doubtful accounts balance was million as of december  and million as of december  goodwill we record as goodwill the amount by which the total purchase price we pay for our acquisitions exceeds our estimated fair value of the net assets we acquire 
beginning in  we test our recorded goodwill annually for impairment and charge income with any impairment we recognize  but we do not otherwise amortize that goodwill 
the impairment test we use consists of comparing our estimates of the current fair values of our reporting units with their carrying amounts 
we use a variety of valuation approaches  primarily the discounted future cash flow approach  to arrive at these estimates 
these approaches entail making numerous assumptions respecting future circumstances  such as general or local industry or market conditions  and  therefore  are uncertain 
for the year ended december   we recognized a transitional impairment charge to earnings  net of tax  of million and an impairment charge to income from operations of million in the fourth quarter of we did not record a goodwill impairment charge for the year ended december  we can provide no assurance that future goodwill impairments will not occur 
the goodwill balance was million as of december  and million as of december  see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report for further discussion 
insurance programs we maintain third party insurance coverage in amounts and against the risks we believe are reasonable 
under our insurance program since july  we share the risk of loss with our insurance underwriters by 
table of contents maintaining high deductibles subject to aggregate annual loss limitations 
we fund these deductibles and record an expense for losses we expect under the programs 
we determine the expected losses using a combination of our historical loss experience and subjective assessments of our future loss exposure 
the estimated losses are subject to uncertainty from various sources  including changes in claims reporting patterns  claims settlement patterns  judicial decisions  legislation and economic conditions 
although we believe the estimated losses are reasonable  significant differences related to the items we have noted above could materially affect our insurance obligations and future expense 
the amount accrued for self insurance claims was million as of december  and million as of december  we record these amounts as accrued liabilities 
income taxes we use the liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  we record deferred income taxes based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and use enacted tax rates and laws that we expect will be in effect when we recover those assets or settle those liabilities  as the case may be  to measure those taxes 
we believe our earnings during the periods when the temporary differences become deductible will be sufficient to realize the related future income tax benefits 
in cases where the expiration date of tax carryforwards or the projected operating results indicate that realization is not likely  we would provide for a valuation allowance 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we estimate future taxable income  considering the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies and the realizability of tax loss carryforwards 
valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes in tax laws  changes in statutory tax rates and future taxable income levels 
if we determined that we would not be able to realize all or a portion of our deferred tax assets in the future  we would reduce such amounts through a charge to income in the period in which that determination is made 
conversely  if we determined that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net carrying amounts  we would decrease the recorded valuation allowance through an increase to income in the period in which that determination is made 
subsequently recognized tax benefits associated with valuation allowances  recorded in connection with a business combination  will be recorded as an adjustment to goodwill 
property  plant and equipment  net we state our property  plant and equipment at cost and use the straight line method to compute depreciation of these assets over their estimated remaining useful lives 
our estimates of those remaining useful lives may be affected by such factors as changing market conditions  technological advances within the industry or changes in regulations governing the industry 
we evaluate the recoverability of our property  plant and equipment when changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we compare the carrying value of long lived assets to our projection of future undiscounted cash flows attributable to those assets 
if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows  we record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value over the fair value 
actual useful lives and future cash flows could be different from those estimated by our management 
these differences could have a material effect on our future operating results

sales decreased million  or  from million in to million in the decrease is attributable to a decrease in the volume of ready mixed concrete we sold and a decline in our average ready mixed concrete price and was primarily due to the general decline in nonresidential construction markets reflecting the general state of the overall economy  employment levels in the united states  sustained adverse weather conditions in several of our markets for a portion of the year and the realignment of our businesses in our north texas operations  partially offset by million in additional sales contributed through our acquisition of builders redi mix  inc in february gross profit before depreciation  depletion and amortization 
gross profit before depreciation  depletion and amortization decreased million  or  from million in to million in gross margins decreased from in to in the decline in gross margin is attributable in part to the correction of an inventory overstatement we describe below under recent events  a relative decline in productivity due to the adverse weather conditions in some of our markets and a relative shift in our project mix from commercial and industrial construction projects to residential construction projects  which typically require products with lower margins  and higher risk and group health insurance costs 
the decline in gross profit was partially offset by million in additional gross profit contributed by the business we acquired in selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  from million in to million in this decrease was attributable to a decline in salary and benefit expenses in primarily due to lower incentive compensation and a reduced provision for doubtful accounts 
this decline in expenses was partially offset by approximately million in additional 
table of contents expenses associated with the business we acquired in and professional fees associated with our investigation of the inventory overstatement we describe below under recent events 
restructuring and impairments

for additional information  see note to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
income tax provision 
we provided for income taxes of million in  an increase of million from our provision in our income taxes increased principally because we had restructuring charges and goodwill impairments in that caused our results to be lower in that year 
our effective tax rate was for and for cumulative effect of accounting change 
our net income does not include any cumulative effect of accounting change 
our net loss included a cumulative effect of accounting change  net of tax  of million as a result of our adoption of sfas no 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  sales 
sales increased million  or  from million in to million in the increase was attributable to a full year of revenues associated with businesses we acquired in  revenues of million associated with the aggregates business we acquired in the first quarter of and a modest average ready mixed concrete price increase 
partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in volumes of ready mixed concrete we sold 
gross profit before depreciation  depletion and amortization 
gross profit before depreciation  depletion and amortization increased million  or  from million in to million in gross margins increased from in to in these increases were attributable to a gross profit of million associated with the aggregates business acquired in in  the lower volumes of ready mixed concrete depressed gross profit and margin 
selling  general and administrative expenses

table of contents expenses incurred by the aggregate business we acquired in the first quarter of  increased communication costs in some of our markets  increased professional fees  higher sales compensation costs  higher advertising and travel costs and higher incentive compensation expense 
special compensation charge 
in  we granted additional compensation to members of our management team and some of our key employees in recognition of the overall contribution made by those employees to our various capital raising initiatives 
this special award was in addition to our recurring annual incentive compensation program 
restructuring and impairments 
in  we recorded an impairment charge of million for goodwill impairments related to two reporting units in our north texas southwest oklahoma and memphis  tennessee northern mississippi markets 
we also recorded charges totaling million related primarily to the realignment of our business in north texas 
for additional information  see note to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report

other income  net  increased million  or  from million in to million in this increase was attributable to a gain we realized in on the sale of fcc licenses in our northern california market 
income tax provision 
we provided for income taxes of million in  a decrease of million from our provision in this decrease was principally the result of lower taxable income generated by our operations during the effective tax rate was for and for the change in this rate was due to the operating loss  nondeductible items relating to goodwill impairments and state income taxes 
cumulative effect of accounting change 
the net loss includes a cumulative effect of accounting change  net of tax  as a result of our adoption of sfas no 
under sfas no 
 we recorded a transitional goodwill impairment charge of million  net of tax  effective january  this impairment charge was attributable to two reporting units  our divisions in north texas southwest oklahoma and memphis  tennessee northern mississippi 
local market and economic conditions affected the value of acquisitions made in north texas in and and memphis  tennessee northern mississippi in 
liquidity and capital resources we require cash to pay our operating expenses  make capital expenditures and service our debt and other long term liabilities 
since our inception  cash also has been the primary component in the consideration we have paid to acquire businesses after our initial public offering 
for the acquisitions we have made since our initial public offering in may  we have used million in cash net of million in cash received to pay approximately of the total purchase price 
we expect that cash would be a significant  if not principal  element in acquisitions we might make in the foreseeable future 
our principal sources of funds are from our operations and the capital markets  principally the commercial and institutional debt markets 

table of contents the principal factors that could adversely affect the availability of our internally generated funds include any further deterioration of sales due to weakness in markets in which we operate  any further decline in gross margins due to shifts in our project mix  and the extent to which we are unable to generate internal growth through integration of additional businesses or capital expansions of our existing business 
the principal factors that could adversely affect our ability to obtain cash from external sources include financial covenants contained in our subordinated notes and our new credit facility  volatility in the markets for corporate debt  and fluctuations in the market price of our common stock 
the following key financial measurements reflect our financial position and capital resources as of december   and dollars in thousands cash and cash equivalents working capital total debt debt as a percent of capital employed during  we experienced a decrease in working capital of million  due primarily to the classification of our first principal payment of million on our subordinated debt  which is due in november  as a current liability as of december   partially offset by the increase in trade receivables contributed by the business we acquired in and higher fourth quarter sales in compared to fourth quarter sales in at december   we had outstanding borrowings totaling million at a weighted average annual interest rate of 
refinancing of prior credit facility at december   we had borrowings of million outstanding under a million revolving credit facility that was scheduled to expire in may the weighted average annual interest cost of those borrowings on that date was 
on march   we terminated that facility and repaid the entire amount then outstanding thereunder with borrowings under our new asset backed revolving credit and term loan facility we describe below 
the availability of credit to us under the terminated facility was limited by various financial ratios  including a leverage ratio  we were required to maintain  and we paid commitment fees on our unused capacity regardless of its availability 
as of march   we estimate that the total lender and professional fees and expenses we incurred in connection with this refinancing  including fees paid to the holders of our senior subordinated notes  will be approximately million 
we estimate that we will charge approximately million of this amount against income in the first quarter of and charge the remainder over the terms of our new facility and the senior subordinated notes 
new credit facility our new asset backed credit facility consists of a revolving credit facility of up to million and a term loan facility of up to million which we have secured with substantially all our assets 
the availability of 
table of contents credit to us under each facility will be tied to and limited by the value of specified assets we have pledged to secure the facilities 
on march   we borrowed million under the revolving credit facility and million under the term loan facility 
the balance of the term loan facility will be available to us until june  if we meet specified conditions  principally the establishment of additional collateral value for the term loan 
we have the option until june  to reallocate the balance of the term loan to increase the revolving credit facility in such an amount 
the revolving credit facility will terminate  and all revolving credit loans will become due  on march  the term loan will be payable in a lump sum on march  both the revolving credit loans and the term loan will be subject to the mandatory prepayment provisions we describe below 
prepayments under the revolving credit facility will not reduce the amount thereafter available to us under the facility  while amounts prepaid on the term loan cannot be reborrowed 
the revolving credit loans and the term loan will bear interest at fluctuating rates payable monthly in arrears 
these rates will be either a domestic base rate or  after the earlier to occur of april  and the completion of syndication of the loans  a eurodollar rate plus  in each case  a margin 
we generally will have the option to specify whether the domestic rate or the eurodollar rate will apply to all or a portion of the loans 
in the case of domestic rate loans  the margin will be basis points for revolving credit loans and basis points for the term loan until september  thereafter  the rate margins for revolving credit loans and the term loan will vary according to the amount of unused borrowing capacity available to us under the revolving credit facility 
the maximum margins will apply if that capacity is less than million  and the margins will decrease as that capacity increases in specified increments 
at march   based on the domestic base rate  the weighted average annual interest rate of our initial borrowings under the new facility was 
our ability to borrow under the revolving credit facility will be limited at any time to our available credit at that time 
under the credit agreement for the facility  the available credit at any time will be the amount of our unborrowed capacity at that time which we actually may borrow and will be determined primarily by a borrowing base equal to of certain of the following types of collateral meeting the agreement s eligibility requirements for inclusion in the base our receivables  our inventories  and our mixer trucks 
for purposes of computing the borrowing base  inventories and trucks will be valued at their net orderly liquidation value as defined 
the borrowing base generally will be determined monthly 
the credit agreement provides that the administrative agent may  on the bases specified  reduce the amount of the available credit from time to time 
in addition  while our senior subordinated notes remain outstanding  the limitations these notes impose on our incurrence of debt also may reduce the amount of our available credit 
at march   after giving effect to our initial borrowings under the revolving credit facility  the amount of our available credit was million 
we will pay a monthly commitment fee on the average daily unused commitments under the revolving credit facility at the annual rate of 
the credit agreement contains two financial covenants 
one would require us to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio from time to time if our available credit under the revolving credit facility falls below million 
the other will restrict our capital expenditures as defined to million in and  in each year thereafter  to of our consolidated revenues for the preceding year 
the credit agreement also contains various affirmative and negative covenants with which we must comply  including a prohibition of cash dividends on or redemptions of our common stock and restrictions on our ability to incur additional debt and liens  sell assets otherwise than in the ordinary course of business  make investments and effect acquisitions of additional businesses 

table of contents the credit agreement also provides for mandatory prepayments of the revolving credit loans in the event the amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility become under collateralized and in certain other events  including various types of asset sales  insured casualty or loss events  debt incurrences and equity issuances 
the term loan also is subject to prepayment in the event it becomes under collateralized and upon certain other events  including certain asset sales 
the credit agreement specifies various events that would constitute defaults or events of default thereunder  including a change of control as defined  and provides for customary remedies during the continuation of any such event of default 
senior subordinated notes we have outstanding million of our senior subordinated notes due november  these notes are mandatorily repayable in equal annual installments of approximately million in each of the years through and contain financial and other covenants with which we must comply 
effective march   we amended the agreement relating to these notes in connection with our entry into our new credit facility 
the amendments include changes in the maximum senior and maximum total debt leverage ratios we must maintain  and changes to accommodate the operation of our new credit facility 
the amendment also prohibits our making new acquisitions of businesses  restricts our ability to make certain payments on or redemptions of our common stock through at least and requires us to pay the holders of the notes an additional amendment fee if we do not prepay the notes in their entirety prior to june  at march   in accordance with the original terms of the notes  this prepayment would entail payment of a loss of yield premium of approximately million  which fluctuates with changes in interest rates 
thus the financing requirement for the retirement of these notes currently would be approximately million plus accrued interest on the million principal amount 
future capital requirements for  our current capital requirements include approximately million of capital expenditures we plan to make and the million principal repayment due in november on our subordinated notes 
this principal repayment and the scheduled principal repayments on these notes in the same amount in each of the next six years each would substantially equate to the cash flow  net of net property  plant and equipment additions  we generated from our operations in our management believes  on the basis of current expectations  that our internally generated cash flow and borrowings under our new credit facility will be sufficient to provide the liquidity necessary to fund our operations and meet our capital and debt service requirements for at least the next months 
if market conditions permit and we are able to refinance our subordinated notes on acceptable terms  we currently plan to do so in the near future 
if we do not refinance these notes  their cash requirements and restrictive covenants  including the new prohibition of acquisitions  will impede continuation of our growth strategy 
cash flow our net cash provided by operating activities is generally the cash effects of transactions and other events used in the determination of net income or loss 
net cash provided by operating activities of million in decreased million  or  from this decrease reflected lower operating profits  partially offset by income tax payments 
our net cash used for investing activities of in decreased million  or  from the net cash used in  primarily due to decreases in funds used for capital expenditures and acquisitions 

table of contents our net cash used in financing activities of million in increased million  or  from the net cash used in this increase was primarily attributable to an increase in debt repayments and debt issuance costs 
we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property  plant and equipment net of disposals 
free cash flow is a performance measure not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
our management uses free cash flow in managing our business because we consider it to be an important indicator of our ability to service our debt and generate cash for acquisitions and other strategic investments 
we believe free cash flow may provide users of our financial information additional meaningful comparisons between current results and results in prior operating periods 
as a non gaap financial measure  free cash flow should be viewed in addition to  and not as an alternative for  our reported operating results or cash flow from operations or any other measure of performance prepared in accordance with gaap 
our historical net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow is as follows in thousands year ended december net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment  net of disposals of   and  free cash flow acquisitions in february  we acquired builders redi mix  inc  which produces and distributes ready mixed concrete in the greater lansing  michigan market 
the purchase price was approximately million  comprised of million in cash  net of cash acquired  transaction costs of million and  shares of common stock valued at million 
other matters off balance sheet arrangements we do not currently have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
from time to time we may enter into noncancellable operating leases that would not be reflected on our balance sheet 
commitments the following are our contractual commitments associated with our indebtedness and our lease obligations as of december  in millions 
the contractual commitments below reflect the refinancing of our prior credit facility on march   as discussed above contractual obligations total less than year years years after years principal of long term debt interest on long term debt operating leases total contractual obligations interest payments due under our senior subordinated notes 

table of contents the following are our commercial commitments expirations as of december  in millions other commercial commitments total less than year years years after years standby letter of credit performance bonds total commercial commitments our purchase obligations were not significant as of december  related party transactions we enter into transactions in the normal course of business with related parties 
these transactions consist principally of operating leases under which we lease facilities from former owners of our acquired businesses or their affiliates and include transactions with some of our officers and directors or their affiliates 
for additional discussion on related party transactions  see note to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
inflation as a result of the relatively low levels of inflation during the past three years  inflation did not significantly affect our results of operations in any of those years 
recent events our results for include the correction of a million inventory overstatement we identified at one of our subsidiaries in our atlantic region  which we acquired in since the impact to our and annual financial statements was not material  we recorded an increase of million  or million net of tax  to cost of goods sold in the third quarter of the cost of goods sold  properly reflected in the respective prior periods  would have decreased annual net income for by million and increased the annual net loss for by million 
we reflected the remaining million of the overstatement  which related to the acquisition date  as a million increase in goodwill and a million increase in deferred tax assets as of december  under the indemnification provisions of the acquisition agreement we entered into with the former owners of that subsidiary  those prior owners provided us with million of indemnification consideration relating to the inventory overstatement 
this amount was recorded as other income in the fourth quarter of we identified the inventory overstatement issue in the third quarter of following the departure of the subsidiary s controller 
we subsequently appointed an accounting officer from our atlantic region as acting controller at that subsidiary and  following that officer s identification of the issue  we began assessing the magnitude of the overstatement 
in conjunction with that assessment  we also undertook an internal investigation to determine the cause and timing of events that led to the overstatement 
following the completion of our investigation  an independent investigation was conducted by outside legal counsel  under the direction of the audit committee of our board of directors 
our internal investigation  supported by this independent investigation  determined that certain accounting policies and procedures were not followed at that subsidiary 
as a result  we increased our inventory controls and oversight of the accounting function at that subsidiary and took appropriate personnel action 
in addition to the actions taken to address this specific issue  our management recommended to the audit committee that we change the lines of reporting for our subsidiary controllers and other accounting personnel at our operating subsidiaries 
specifically  management recommended that such personnel should report directly to 
table of contents our corporate controller  rather than to local operating management 
our board of directors  upon recommendation from management and the audit committee  approved this change  which we implemented throughout our operating subsidiaries in the fourth quarter of in addition  we are also in the process of developing other enhancements to our overall system of internal controls in conjunction with our preparation for compliance with the sec s recently adopted rules under section of the sarbanes oxley act of recent accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  which clarifies the application of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  relating to consolidation of certain entities 
fin will require identification of our participation in variable interest entities vies  which are defined as entities with a level of invested equity that is not sufficient to fund future activities to permit them to operate on a stand alone basis  or whose equity holders lack certain characteristics of a controlling financial interest 
for entities identified as vies  fin sets forth a model to evaluate potential consolidation based on an assessment of which party to the vie  if any  bears a majority of the exposure to its expected losses or stands to gain from a majority of its expected returns 
fin also sets forth certain disclosure requirements regarding interests in vies that are deemed significant  even if consolidation is not required 
as we do not maintain any vies  the adoption of fin  effective january  for entities acquired before february   is not expected to have an impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows

did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
because of the short duration of our investments  changes in market interest rates would not have a significant impact on their aggregate fair value
