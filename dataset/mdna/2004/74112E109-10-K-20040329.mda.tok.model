item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview revenues 
the company generates revenue from products and services provided primarily to the in vitro diagnostic infectious disease industry 
the company currently has four operating segments diagnostics  biotech  laboratory instrumentation and pressure cycling technology pct 
two of these segments  diagnostics and laboratory instrumentation primarily manufacture products 
commencing in  pct products are being manufactured at the laboratory instrumentation segment 
within the diagnostics segment  there are three major product lines quality control panels  accurun external run controls  and diagnostic components 
the remaining two operating segments  biotech and pct  generate primarily service revenue 
within biotech there are four major product lines contract research  repository services  specialty reagents and research services 
revenue in the pct segment consists primarily of both private and national institutes of health nih funded support for the research activities associated with our pressure cycling technology 
there was also nih funding in for the company s former drug discovery operations which were spun off as an independent company in november see note of notes to financial statements for a further discussion of the activities of these segments and note of notes to financial statements relative to the company s discontinued clinical laboratory operations 
in february  bbi clinical laboratories  inc bbicl  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  sold the business and certain assets and liabilities to a third party for an adjusted purchase price of  the company wrote down all of the retained assets to their estimated net realizable value 
the company recorded an after tax gain of  in and an additional after tax gain of  in see also notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements hereunder  included in part ii  item of this form k 
the economics and cost structures of the company s business segments have certain differences 
the diagnostics segment has historically been the company s largest and most profitable segment  both in absolute dollars and in operating profit margin  as it operates primarily in a commercial environment with fewer competitors and relatively short product development cycles 
the laboratory instrumentation segment operates in a highly competitive  low margin business contract manufacturing of instruments and medical devices 
since the company s acquisition of source scientific in  management has continued in its efforts to turn around this business 
at the current low annual revenue level of less than million  it operates significantly under capacity with high fixed overhead costs  and should therefore significantly benefit from relatively small revenue increases 
the bbi biotech segment has been project oriented with a high proportion of its revenue generated from government contracts for both research and service activities and assisting the other segments of the company in their new product and service development 
it has the highest level of inter segment activity  and is structured around project tracking of direct costs plus overhead  general and administrative costs and a low percentage fee 
its financial goal has been to breakeven while contributing to the development of future products and services for the company 
the pct segment s research and development operation launched its first products for commercial sale in revenue to date consists primarily of private and public nih funding of segment research 
most of the expenditures by this segment are for r d expenses  patent costs and general management expenses 
the company continues to seek funding from both private and public sources to minimize the impact of their development costs on the company s overall operating results 
since its commercial introduction in  sales of pct products have been limited primarily due to longer sales cycles than originally anticipated as discussed further hereunder 
factors associated with this sales cycle include the initial selling price of the pct barocycler tm and the limited amount of research data presently available demonstrating its capabilities and potential 
additional refinements in pct instrumentation include the development of a less expensive and smaller  bench top version of the barocycler which was just introduced in quarterly fluctuations historically  the company s results of operations have been subject to quarterly fluctuations due to a variety of factors  primarily customer purchasing patterns  driven by end of year expenditures 
in particular  in the diagnostics segment  the company s sales of its off the shelf quality control products and diagnostic components typically have been highest in the fourth quarter and lowest in the first quarter of each fiscal year  whereas oem product sales may peak in any quarter of the year depending on the production cycle of a given project 
in the company s biotech segment  research contracts are generally for large dollar amounts spread over one to five year periods  and upon completion  frequently do not have renewal phases 
as a result these contracts can cause large fluctuations in revenue and net income 
in addition to staff dedicated to internal research and development  certain of the company s technical staff work on both contract research for customers and company sponsored research and development 
the allocation of certain technical staff to such projects depends on the volume of contract research 
as a result  research and development expenditures fluctuate due to increases or decreases in contract research performed 
neither the laboratory instrumentation segment nor the pct segment is subject to material seasonal variations 
research and development since the acquisition of bioseq  inc in  the company has expended significant amounts for ongoing research and development of new technologies  including in connection with the development of pct 
in the past five years  the company s bioseq research subsidiary has incurred approximately m of research and development expenses substantially related to development of a unique instrument and disposable specimen processing tube in conjunction with pct 
as a result of its efforts  in september  the company was able to release for sale its first products based on its patented pct 
the company is presently manufacturing the barocycler tm instrument and disposable pulse tm tubes utilizing pct at its bbi source scientific facility  however  the sales cycle appears to be of longer duration than expected 
the company has received eleven domestic and four foreign patents for this technology as of the end of the company has invested significantly in research and development  both in whole dollars and as a percentage of revenue  and expects to continue to do so for the foreseeable future as it seeks to continue to develop new applications for pct 
export sales the company has significant export sales in europe  the pacific rim countries and canada to agents under distribution agreements  as well as directly to test kit manufacturers 
all sales are denominated in us dollars 
export sales for the years ended december    and were million  million and million  respectively 
the company expects that export sales will continue to be a significant source of revenue and gross profit 
challenges and opportunities the company also continues to evaluate the performance of both the laboratory instrumentation segment and the pct segment  both of which continue to experience significant operating losses 
the pct segment  which includes both private and public national institutes of health funding of segment research  continues to experience lower than expected product sales since its commercial introduction in september primarily associated with a longer than expected selling cycle for its pct products 
factors associated with this sales cycle include the initial selling price of the pct barocycler tm and the limited amount of research data presently available demonstrating its capabilities and potential 
additional refinements in pct instrumentation include the development of a less expensive and smaller  bench top version of the barocycler which was just introduced in while the company believes strongly in the benefits of pct s novel technology  the market potential of the existing pct barocycler is uncertain 
the manufacture of pct products at the laboratory instrument segment of the business was part of the company s plan to return bbi source scientific  inc to profitability in year the company intends to evaluate other applications and products utilizing pct  including expansion of the pct product line  and to reexamine the core contract manufacturing business of bbi source scientific  inc if these segments do not become profitable  the company may need to write off some or all of the current net book value of these assets in either or both of these segments 
to advise the company with respect to the strategic direction of the company s pct and bbi source scientific activities  and the company s remaining ownership interest in panacos pharmaceuticals  inc  in july  the company engaged mr 
richard t 
schumacher  the company s former chairman and chief executive officer as an executive project consultant 
as part of this engagement  mr 
schumacher is expected to reevaluate the ongoing business prospects for both the laboratory instrumentation segment and pct activities 
on february   the company announced it has extended until december  the executive consultant agreement it has with mr 
schumacher 
under the terms of the consulting agreement  mr 
schumacher is serving in an advisory role directing the company s pct and bbi source scientific activities  the company s interest in panacos pharmaceuticals  inc and such other duties as the president or the board of directors of the company assigns to him 
in addition to these responsibilities  mr

results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated the percentage of total revenue represented by certain items reflected in the company s consolidated statements of operations year ended december  revenue products services total revenue gross profit operating expenses research and development selling and marketing general and administrative total operating expenses operating loss from continuing operations interest expense  net loss before income taxes and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle provision for income taxes income from discontinued operations net income loss product gross profit services gross profit critical accounting policies and estimates to prepare the financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles  management is required to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
in addition  significant estimates were made in determining the gain on disposition of the company s discontinued operations including post closing adjustments  in estimating future cash flows to quantify impairment of assets  in determining the ultimate cost of abandoning a lease associated with discontinued operations at a facility no longer being utilized  in estimates regarding the collectability of accounts receivable  realizability of a receivable from a director former chairman and chief executive officer including sufficiency of collateral see note  deferred tax assets  the net realizable value of its inventory  third party audits  as well as an estimate for other remaining liabilities associated with discontinued operations 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used by management 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue in accordance with the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
 update of codification of staff accounting bulletins sab 
revenue is recognized when realized or earned when all the following criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred and risk of loss has passed  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
product revenue is generally recognized upon shipment of the products 
the company will occasionally recognize revenue on a bill and hold basis after completion of manufacture for specific orders at the request of the customer 
bill and hold sales transactions are entered into after consideration of customer needs and capabilities relating to freezer capability to store biological substances at required temperatures 
all bill and hold transactions meet specified revenue recognition criteria that include the risk of ownership has passed to the customer  the customer has a fixed commitment to purchase the goods  the customer  not the company  has requested the transaction to be on a bill and hold basis  there is a fixed schedule for delivery of the goods  the company does not retain any specific performance obligations such that the earnings process is not complete  the ordered goods are segregated from the company s inventory and not subject to being used to fill other orders  and the goods are complete and ready for shipment 
the company also considers the following prior to recognizing revenue the transaction is subject to normal billing and credit terms for the specific customer  the company s past experience with the pattern of bill and hold transactions  whether the customer has the expected risk of loss in the event of a decline in the market value of the goods  whether the company s custodial risks are insurable and insured  whether apb  pertaining to the need for discounting the related receivables  is applicable  and whether extended procedures are necessary in order to assure that there are no exceptions to the customer s commitment to accept and pay for the goods 
total revenue related to bill and hold transactions was approximately   and  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
revenue from service contracts is earned as the related services are performed 
revenue arrangements where multiple products or services are sold together under one contract are evaluated to determine if each element represents a separate earnings process 
in the event that an element of such multiple element arrangement does not represent a separate earnings process  revenue from this element is recognized over the term of the related contract 
services are recognized as revenue upon completion of tests for laboratory services 
revenue from service contracts and research and development contracts for the company s laboratory instrumentation business is recognized as the service and research and development activities are performed under the terms of the contracts 
revenue under long term contracts  generally lasting from one to five years  including funded research and development contracts  is recorded when costs to perform such research and development activities are incurred 
billings under long term contracts are generally at cost plus a predetermined profit 
billings occur as costs associated with time and materials are incurred 
customers are obligated to pay for such services when billed and payments are non refundable 
on occasion  certain customers make advance payments that are deferred until revenue recognition is appropriate 
total revenue related to long term contracts was approximately   and  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
total contract costs associated with these agreements were approximately   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
included in the revenue recognized under long term contracts are certain unbilled receivables representing additional indirect costs  which are allowed under the terms of the respective contracts 
unbilled receivables were  at december  and less than  for all other years presented 
during the fiscal years  and  the combined revenues from all branches of the national institutes of health  a united states government agency  accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of total consolidated revenues from continuing operations of the company 
additional future revenues originating from various branches of the national institutes of health is subject to possible future changes in government funding levels 
accounts receivable management periodically reviews outstanding balances in accounts receivable to estimate future collections 
based on the company s historical experience  current business conditions and expected future collections  management established an allowance for uncollectible accounts 
in the event circumstances change to affect the assumptions underlying this allowance  the company might be required to take additional write offs of its accounts receivable balances 
inventory inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market 
certain factors may impact the realizable value of the company s inventory including  but not limited to  technological changes  market demand  changes in product mix strategy  new product introductions and significant changes to the company s cost structure 
in addition  estimates of reserves are made for obsolescence based on the current product mix on hand and its expected net realizability 
if actual market conditions are less favorable or other factors arise that are significantly different than those anticipated by management  additional inventory write downs or increases in obsolescence reserves may be required 
the company treats lower of cost or market adjustments and inventory reserves as adjustments to the cost basis of the underlying inventory 
accordingly  favorable changes in market conditions are not recorded to inventory in subsequent periods 
long lived assets and goodwill intangible assets primarily relate to the remaining value of acquired patents associated with pct 
the cost of these acquired patents is amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated life of the patent  which is generally four to sixteen years 
the company s policy regarding long lived assets is to evaluate the recoverability or usefulness of these assets when the facts and circumstances suggest that these assets may be impaired 
this analysis relies on a number of factors  including changes in strategic direction  business plans  regulatory developments  economic and budget projections  technological improvements  and operating results 
the test of recoverability or usefulness is a comparison of the asset value to the undiscounted cash flow of its expected cumulative net operating cash flow over the asset s remaining useful life 
any write downs would be treated as permanent reductions in the carrying amount of the asset and an operating loss would be recognized 
to date  the company has had recurring operating losses in the pct segment and the recoverability of the company s long lived assets is contingent upon it executing its business plan that includes expected revenues and cash flows to be generated from sales of pct products and services 
the company s goodwill relates to its acquisition of the laboratory instrumentation operating segment 
this segment is expected to continue to manufacture pct related products and the realizability of this goodwill is dependant  among other factors  on the success of the company s pct product line 
if the company is unable to execute its business plans related to pct  it may be required to write down the remaining value of its long lived assets and goodwill in future periods 
deferred tax valuation allowance a valuation allowance is established if it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
in  the company established a full valuation allowance for its deferred tax assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
and in consideration of three consecutive years of losses 
the company has not recognized an income tax benefit associated with the loss from continuing operations in   and  as these tax assets have been fully reserved for 
accordingly  a valuation allowance has been established for the full amount of the deferred tax asset due to the uncertainty of realization 
discontinued operations the company periodically reviews the adequacy of its reserve for discontinued operations associated with the company s decision to exit the clinical laboratory testing segment of the business in the company has established reserves to cover expected future costs including those associated with an existing facility lease expiring july see also note of notes to consolidated financial statements hereunder  included in part ii  item of this form k 
loan receivable from director and former chairman and chief executive officer as of december   the company evaluated the recoverability of a  loan receivable from its former chairman and chief executive officer  which is reflected on its balance sheet in stockholders equity as a loan receivable as of december  the company s review includes an evaluation of the collateral associated with the loan 
the company maintains a junior interest in this collateral 
as of december   the remaining collateral consists of common stock of the company 
when considering the adequacy of the collateral for the company s  receivable  the company considers the balance of a loan outstanding  as of december  between an entity controlled by its former chairman and chief executive officer with a financial institution and the fact that the company has a junior position in regards to the remaining collateral associated with that loan  as well as the liquidity and net realizable value of the remaining assets underlying the collateral 
the ultimate value that may be recovered by the company is dependant on numerous factors including market conditions relative to the value of and ability to sell the company s common stock  and the financial status of its former chairman and chief executive officer 
at december   the company performed a test for impairment of its loan receivable by analyzing the value of the collateral  and determined that the loan receivable was not impaired 
while the loan receivable was not impaired as of december   the termination of the company s chairman and chief executive officer by the board of directors in february  together with the fluctuations in the quoted market value of the company s common stock  which comprises the remaining collateral  are indicators of impairment 
based on the company s assessment as of and through february  the company estimates that the value of the collateral approximates the amount of the company s recorded loan 
if actual market conditions are less favorable or other factors arise that are significantly different than those anticipated by management  a write down of this asset might be required

cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was  compared to  during year the decline in cash used for investing in was due to managements decision to reduce and or defer capital expenditures  whereas in year  capital expenditures included the purchase of a dna sequencer at the company s biotech segment and the construction of several preproduction pct barocyclers tm as demonstration units 
cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  was  compared to cash used of  during in early  the company pledged  via a deposit in an interest bearing escrow account at a financial institution  this was partially offset by repayment to the company of a loan to richard t 
schumacher as discussed further below 
in february  the company entered into a three year   line of credit agreement with a private lender 
the line of credit bears interest at the base rate plus  carries commercially standard unused line and collateral management fees payable monthly  and is collateralized by trade accounts receivable and inventory of the company 
borrowings under the line are limited to commercially standard terms and percentages of accounts receivable at present 
the line of credit contains covenants regarding maintenance of minimum debt service coverage ratios  and provides certain restrictions on the payments of dividends and incurring additional debt 
based on current forecasts and the february establishment of a line of credit as discussed above  management believes the company has sufficient liquidity to finance operations for the next twelve months 
management s forecasts involve assumptions that could prove to be incorrect 
if the company continues to incur operating losses or incurs negative cash flows from operations  it may need to raise additional funds 
there can be no assurance that these funds will be available when required on terms acceptable to the company  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available when needed  the company may be required to further reduce certain of its costs and delay  scale back  or eliminate certain of its activities  any of which could have a material adverse long term effect on its business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company is considering various sources of additional financing  including but not limited to  sale of business segments  strategic alliances and private placements of debt or equity securities  which could result in dilution to the company s stockholders 
on october   the company retained an investment banking firm to advise the company in the evaluation of strategic opportunities aimed at increasing shareholder value and liquidity by increasing the capital needed for growth  their engagement continues at this time

the company leases  square feet of space in garden grove  california where its bbi source business unit manufactures laboratory instruments 
the lease for this facility expires january  and there is currently no extension or renewal option 
in march  the company entered into an eleven year lease agreement with an existing landlord for approximately  sq ft of new repository space located in frederick  md  this lease is scheduled to take effect in two stages  august  and august  assuming occupancy of the new facility by the company on august   the landlord has agreed to terminate in full the company s remaining obligations pursuant to an existing facility lease in frederick  md which was scheduled to terminate in november incremental minimum lease payments pursuant to the new lease which are net of savings associated with the concurrent termination of the existing lease would amount to  in year   in years   in years  and  thereafter  these amounts are not included in the table above as this lease is subject to cancellation at the sole option of the company on or before april  without penalty 
the company acquired in all the remaining outstanding common stock of bioseq  inc  a development stage company involved with pct 
in accordance with the provisions of a technology transfer agreement assumed in the transaction  the company is obligated to pay a royalty on net sales until march of future sales by any entity of the company utilizing pct  with required minimum royalty payments having ended in the company announced the availability of its pct products for commercial sale in the latter part of year in december  the company made a decision to exit the clinical laboratory testing services segment and in february  bbi clinical laboratories  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
the company s estimate of remaining short and long term accrued liabilities to exit the clinical laboratory testing business is  as of december  see also note of notes to consolidated financial statements hereunder  included in part ii  item of this form k  future reductions in amounts due pursuant to the lease termination agreement are not reflected in the above table 
in february  the company entered into a three year   line of credit agreement with a private lender  any amounts due pursuant to this agreement are not included in the table 
related party transaction as of december   the company had entered into a one year loan of  to richard t 
schumacher  the company s former chairman and chief executive officer and a current director of the company  renewable at the company s option  and collateralized by  of mr 
schumacher s shares of the company s common stock 
this loan constituted an increase from the  that had been loaned as of september  interest on the loan was payable at the annual rate of  of which  was remitted to the company in the spring of  in february  the company s board of directors determined this payment constituted the full amount owed and that the company and mr 
schumacher no longer have any further dispute over this obligation 
as of december   the loan was shown on the balance sheet as a decrease to stockholders equity 
in january  the principal of these loans was repaid in full with a portion of the proceeds of the loans described in the following sentence 
the company s loans were replaced by the company s pledge of a  interest bearing deposit at a financial institution to secure the company s limited guaranty of loans in the aggregate amount of  from the financial institution to an entity controlled by mr 
schumacher 
the loans are personally guaranteed by mr 
schumacher 
the company s pledge is secured by a junior subordinated interest in the collateral provided by mr 
schumacher to the financial institution 
the remaining collateral as of december  includes substantially all of his common stock holdings in the company 
the company s original loan and subsequent pledge of  were made to assist mr 
schumacher in refinancing indebtedness related to  among other things  his divorce settlement and to enable him to avoid the need to sell his common stock holdings in the company on the open market to satisfy his debts 
the company s board of directors and  with respect to the decision to pledge the  cash collateral  a special committee of the independent directors  evaluated a number of options and concluded that the original loan to mr 
schumacher and the subsequent pledge were the best option and in the best interests of the company s stockholders in the belief that it would  among other things  avoid selling pressure on the company s common stock and relieve the financial pressures on mr 
schumacher that could otherwise divert his attention from the company 
in january  the  account was used to satisfy the company s limited guaranty obligation 
the company has now satisfied its obligation under the limited guaranty and pledge with the financial institution 
the company continues to maintain its junior interest in collateral pledged by mr 
schumacher to the financial institution 
the remaining collateral includes certain of mr 
schumacher s common stockholdings in the company 
the company reflected the  pledge as restricted cash on its balance sheet until the cash was used to satisfy the company s limited guaranty in january and since then has reflected a  loan receivable on its balance sheet in stockholder s equity 
on february   the company announced that its board of directors terminated mr 
schumacher as chairman and chief executive officer  effective immediately 
mr 
schumacher remains a director of the company 
kevin w 
quinlan  president and chief operating officer  continued to lead day to day operations 
a special committee of the board of directors was appointed to oversee the management of the affairs of the company until such time as a new chief executive officer is employed 
on july   the company announced that mr 
schumacher agreed to accept an engagement with the company as an executive project consultant to advise the company with respect to the strategic direction of the company s pct and bbi source scientific activities and the company s ownership interest in panacos pharmaceuticals  inc bbi source scientific  inc 
is the company s california based instrument subsidiary  which developed and manufactures the pct barocycler instrument 
as part of this engagement  mr 
schumacher has continued to reevaluate the ongoing business prospects for both the company s laboratory instrumentation segment and pct activities 
on february   the company announced it had extended until december  the executive consultant agreement it has with mr 
schumacher 
under the terms of the consulting agreement  mr 
schumacher is serving in an advisory role directing the company s pct and bbi source scientific activities  the company s interest in panacos pharmaceuticals  inc and such other duties as the president or the board of directors of the company assigns to him

risk factors this report contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  such as statements of our objectives  expectations and intentions 
the cautionary statements made in this report should be read as applicable to all forward looking statements wherever they appear in this report 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed herein 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed below  as well as those discussed elsewhere in this report 
we rely on purchase orders and contracts from a small number of customers for a large portion of our revenues  the loss of business from these customers could materially reduce our revenues and harm our business 
purchase orders account for the majority of our orders  none of our customers have contractually committed to make future product purchases from us 
in  our three largest commercial customers  kyowa  american red cross and quest  together accounted for approximately of our revenues 
in addition  the various agencies of the national institutes of health  including the national institutes of allergies and infectious disease  the national cancer institute and the national heart lung and blood institute  in the aggregate  accounted for approximately of our revenues in each agency within the national institutes of health  however  makes independent purchasing decisions 
the loss of any major customer  including any agency within the national institutes of health  the failure of any agency of the national institutes of health to fully fund any contract or renew any contract with us  or a material reduction in any major customer s purchases would materially reduce our revenues and our operating results 
if we are unable to increase our sales of quality control products to end users of infectious disease test kits  then our future revenues could be impacted 
currently  we sell most of our quality control products for infectious disease test kits to test kit manufacturers and regulators  which is a relatively small market 
however  we also sell our quality control products to end users of infectious disease test kits  including hospital laboratories  blood donor testing centers  public health laboratories and commercial laboratories 
this end user market is a larger market which has not yet become accustomed to using quality control products to monitor test results  but which we believe is a growing market 
currently  we expect an increase in both the frequency of use and the number of products used by our current end user customers 
however  these end users of infectious disease test kits may not increase their use of our products 
further  large manufacturers and distributors of quality control products that have historically sold to the non infectious disease market and that have greater financial  manufacturing and marketing resources than we have could begin selling their products to the end users of infectious disease test kits 
this would increase competition for an adequate supply of the rare specimens of plasma and serum necessary for certain of our quality control and run control products 
if the end user market for quality control products for infectious disease testing does not develop further  or if we are unable to increase sales of our products to this market  our future revenues could be substantially less than we have projected 
if our bbi bioseq  inc 
and bbi source scientific  inc 
subsidiaries continue to have substantial operating losses  then we may not be able to realize the book value of their assets 
our bbi bioseq subsidiary has incurred significant operating losses  since our acquisition of that company in september this subsidiary may not be successful in marketing and further developing its technology  and its technology may never achieve commercial viability 
accordingly  our bbi bioseq subsidiary may never become profitable and it may be necessary to write off some or all of the current net book value of its intangible assets related to its patents 
as a result of our july acquisition of source scientific  inc  we recorded approximately  of goodwill 
since this acquisition  our bbi source scientific subsidiary has also incurred significant cumulative operating losses that subsidiary may continue to have operating losses and may never become profitable 
if operating losses continue  it may be necessary to write off some or all of the remaining goodwill associated with bbi source scientific 
if we are unable to obtain both the necessary regulatory approvals and substantial funds for our bbi bioseq subsidiary s products  or if demand for new products and services fails to materialize  our future revenues and income will be less than we have projected 
our bbi bioseq subsidiary  in conjunction with our other subsidiaries has developed products that involved significant development  preclinical and clinical testing  regulatory approvals and investment of substantial funds prior to their commercialization 
our bbi bioseq subsidiary and bbi source scientific subsidiary have developed a pressure cycling technology process into a working laboratory instrument now available for commercial sale 
we first introduced our barocycler instrument and related disposable pulse tubes based upon pressure cycling technology for commercial sale in september demand for these commercial applications of pressure cycling technology may not materialize as expected 
as a result  we may not be successful in selling the barocycler instrument and disposable pulse tubes in sufficient numbers to be commercially viable 
in addition  we may not be successful in further developing pressure cycling technology into other commercially viable products and services  or such activities may take longer than currently expected  and if successful in such development activities  demand for such products and services may not develop as we anticipate 
while we have eleven issued us patents and four foreign patents as of december  relating to pressure cycling technology  certain pressure cycling technology applications may not fall within the claims of those issued patents 
further  individuals and groups utilizing pressure cycling technology may not be required to license such technology from us 
further  our future revenues and income could be less than we have projected 
because of the lengthy sales cycles of our pct products  we may incur significant expenses before we generate any revenues related to those products 
our customers have required several months to test and evaluate our pct related products 
this increases the possibility that a customer may decide to cancel or change plans  which could reduce or eliminate our sales to that customer 
as a result of this lengthy sales cycle  we have incurred and may continue to incur significant research and development expenses  and selling  general and administrative expenses  before we generate the related revenues for these products  and we may never generate the anticipated revenues if a customer cancels or changes its plans 
factors associated with this sales cycle include the initial selling price of the pct barocycler tm and the limited amount of research data presently available demonstrating its capabilities and potential 
additional refinements in pct instrumentation include the development of a less expensive and smaller  bench top version of the barocycler which was just introduced in  however  there can be no assurance that this bench top model will be successful 
if the fda requires clearance or approval for our products that are designated only for research and not for diagnostic procedures or our products that we believe are exempt from fda clearance and initiates enforcement action for our failure to do so  we will likely expend significant resources to resolve the matter which could harm our business 
in the united states  the food  drug  and cosmetic act prohibits the marketing of most in vitro diagnostic products until the food and drug administration either clears or approves the products through processes that are time consuming  expensive and uncertain 
some in vitro diagnostic products may be exempt from fda clearance or approval if they have undergone validation studies 
as of december   of our accurun products currently on the market have met the fda s regulatory requirements 
during  our accurun external run controls products accounted for approximately of our revenue 
it is possible that the fda may not agree that some of these products are entitled to an exemption and may adopt a different interpretation of the food  drug  and cosmetic act or other laws it administers 
we believe that products which are used only for research and not in diagnostic procedures are not subject to fda clearance or approval 
we currently label some of our products for research use only because they are not intended for use in diagnostic procedures  and have not been cleared or approved by the fda 
it is possible  however  that some purchasers of these products may use them for diagnostic purposes rather than for research  despite our labeling 
under any of these circumstances  the fda could allege that some or all of these products should have been cleared or approved  or otherwise validated prior to marketing  and could initiate enforcement action against us 
if the fda initiates enforcement action against us  we will likely expend a large amount of time  money  resources and management attention to resolve the matter 
in addition  if we cannot obtain or are delayed in obtaining fda clearances or approvals for our products  we may encounter delays or be unable to ever sell those products 
if we fail to comply with good manufacturing practices in connection with the manufacture of our medical device products  we may not be able to distribute our products and may not generate product revenues 
we are also subject to strict fda good manufacturing practice regulations which govern testing  control and documentation practices  and other post marketing restrictions on the manufacture of our medical device products 
our in vitro diagnostic products and our laboratory instrumentation products are considered medical device products  as defined by the fda 
regulatory authorities monitor our ongoing compliance with good manufacturing practices and other applicable regulatory requirements through periodic inspections 
if we fail to comply with good manufacturing practices or other regulatory requirements  we may not be able to obtain future pre market clearances or approvals  or the fda or other regulatory agencies may impose corrective action requirements  including total or partial suspension of product distribution  injunctions  civil penalties  recall or seizure of products  and criminal prosecution 
any of these events would lead to increased costs and a drain on resources and could reduce our revenues and operating results 
because we conduct our business worldwide  changes in international regulatory requirements may materially reduce our total revenues 
our international sales accounted for approximately of our total revenues for the year ended december  our accurun external run controls products are subject to ce marking requirements in the european union 
as of december   a total of accurun external run control products designed for the european market have met the regulatory requirements to carry the ce mark under the european union s in vitro diagnostics ivd directive 
the ivd directive describes criteria that must be met and steps that must be taken for ivd products to be qualified for sale in european union countries beginning at the end of in the ivd directive  the european union classifies products according to the risks associated with their failure or misuse  and establishes a process leading to a ce mark approval to sell a product in eu countries for each category 
changes in international regulatory requirements and policies  including both changes in existing restrictions and future restrictions on importation of blood and blood derivatives  could result in reduced international sales  which may materially reduce our total revenues and income 
if we are unable to obtain a steady and adequate supply of rare specimens of plasma and serum  then we may be unable to produce our quality control panel products and our accurun external run controls products which would harm our business 
we manufacture our diagnostic products  including our quality control panel products and accurun external run controls products  from human plasma and serum which we obtain from nonprofit and commercial blood centers in the united states and from similar sources throughout the world 
our bbi diagnostics business unit  which manufactures and sells these diagnostic products  accounts for approximately of our revenues 
our quality control panel products and accurun external run controls products contain rare plasma specimens that we collect from individuals who have been infected with particular diseases 
the specimens are rare because we can collect them only during the brief period of time when the markers for a particular disease in an infected individual are converting from negative to positive 
it is difficult to identify such infected individuals and to collect specimens from them during the brief period of time when the markers for a particular disease are converting from negative to positive 
as a result  quantities of these specimens are limited 
as we sell our quality control panel products and accurun external run controls products  we must find replacement specimens that are equally rare 
we may also face competition to obtain these specimens which could further limit our ability to obtain the specimens and to produce our quality control panel products and accurun external run controls products 
a limit in our ability to produce our products would reduce our future revenues and operating results 
if we are not able to react quickly to technological change  we may not be able to compete effectively 
the infectious disease test kit industry is characterized by rapid and significant technological change  and changes in customer requirements 
as a result  our ability to continue to compete effectively in this industry depends upon our ability to enhance our existing products and to develop or acquire  and introduce in a timely manner  new products that take advantage of technological advances and respond to customer requirements 
we may not be successful in developing and marketing such new products or enhancements to our existing products on a timely basis  if at all  and such products may not adequately address the changing needs of the marketplace 
furthermore  rapid technological development may result in our products or services becoming obsolete or noncompetitive before we recover our investment in research  development and commercialization 
if we cannot protect our intellectual property  we may be unable to compete effectively 
our ability to compete effectively with other companies depends in part on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technologies and products 
we rely primarily on a combination of trade secrets and non disclosure and confidentiality agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our technology and products 
for the pressure cycling technology developed by our bbi bioseq subsidiary  we have eleven us and four foreign patents issued as of december  if we have not adequately protected our technology  or if our competitors misappropriate our intellectual property  we could lose market share and our future revenues and operating income could be significantly less than projected 
we may be subject to claims of infringement of third party intellectual property rights  or demands that we license third party technology  which could result in significant expense and prevent us from selling one or more of our products 
we have in the past been  and may in the future be  notified that we may be infringing intellectual property rights possessed by other third parties 
we cannot guarantee that infringement claims by third parties or other claims for indemnification resulting from infringement claims will not be asserted in the future or that such assertions  if proven to be true  will not materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we cannot predict the extent to which we might be required to seek licenses  pay royalties or alter our products so that they no longer infringe the rights of others 
we also cannot guarantee that the terms of any licenses we may be required to seek or royalties we may be required to pay will be reasonable 
similarly  changing our products or processes to avoid infringing the rights of others may be costly or impractical and could detract from the value of our products 
if a judgment of infringement were obtained against us  we could be required to pay substantial damages and a court could issue an order preventing us from selling one or more of our products 
further the cost and diversion of management attention brought about by such litigation could be substantial  even if we were to prevail 
any of these events could result in significant expense to us and may materially harm our business and our prospects 
if we are unable to attract and retain a new chief executive officer  then we may not be successful in fully executing our business plan 
on february   we announced the termination of our chairman and chief executive officer  he remains a director of the company 
a special committee of our board of directors was appointed to oversee management of the affairs of the company until such time as a new chief executive officer is employed 
there are a limited number of qualified candidates for the position with the necessary technical background and management experience 
we are competing for those candidates with companies that are larger and have greater financial resources than we 
if we are not able to attract and retain a new  suitably qualified  chief executive officer within a reasonable period of time  we may not be able to properly evaluate our strategic choices  our existing management may not be able to focus their attention on all necessary management matters and we may not be successful in fully executing our business plan 
if we are unable to attract and retain highly qualified scientific and management personnel  then we may not be able to develop and refine our products and services 
our products and services are highly technical and our key personnel must have specialized training or advanced degrees in order to develop and refine these products and services 
there are a limited number of qualified scientific and management personnel who possess the technical background necessary to adequately understand and improve our products and services 
we compete for these personnel with other companies  academic institutions  government entities and other organizations engaged in research and development of products similar to ours 
if we are unable to attract and retain scientific and management personnel with the appropriate credentials who are capable of developing and refining our products and services  then our products and services could become inaccurate or unreliable  or could fail to obtain fda approval and we may be unable to deliver new products 
we may not be able to fully collect the principal and interest due on a  receivable from our former chairman and chief executive officer which could harm our business and financial condition 
as of january  we recorded a  receivable from our former chairman and chief executive officer  richard t 
schumacher 
we continue to maintain a junior security interest in collateral pledged by mr 
schumacher to a financial institution 
the remaining collateral as of december  includes certain of mr 
schumacher s shares of our common stock 
the collateral and personal assets of mr 
schumacher may not be sufficient to permit us to fully recover the principal  interest and other costs associated with this receivable 
if the value of the collateral decreases  we may have to write down or write off the receivable 
therefore  we cannot be certain that we will collect the full amount of the receivable 
our failure to collect all or a portion of this receivable could harm our business and financial condition 
a few stockholders control a significant percentage of voting power and may exercise their voting power in a manner adverse to other stockholders interests 
our former chairman and chief executive officer  mr 
richard t 
schumacher  and our other existing officers and directors collectively have voting control over approximately of the outstanding shares of our common stock as of december  in addition  approximately of the outstanding shares of our common stock as of december  were controlled by mr 
richard kiphart  an unaffiliated investor 
accordingly  these stockholders  should they choose to act in concert  are in a position to exercise a significant degree of control and to significantly influence stockholder votes on the election of directors  increasing the authorized capital stock  and authorizing mergers and sales of assets 
these stockholders may act in a manner that is adverse to your personal interests 
provisions in our charter and by laws and our shareholder rights plan may discourage or frustrate stockholders attempts to remove or replace our current management 
our amended and restated articles of organization and restated bylaws contain provisions that may make more difficult or discourage changes in our management that our stockholders may consider to be favorable 
these provisions include a classified board of directors  advance notice for stockholder nominations to the board of directors  limitations on the ability of shareholders to remove directors  and a provision that allows a majority of the directors to fill vacancies on the board of directors 
these provisions could prevent or frustrate stockholders attempts to make changes in our management that our stockholders consider to be beneficial 
on february   our board of directors adopted a shareholder purchase rights plan 
this plan may have the effect of discouraging or preventing a change in control 
all of these provisions could limit the price that our stockholders might receive in the future for shares of our common stock 
the exercise of all outstanding options and the conversion of all outstanding warrants could have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock 
we have  options outstanding as of december  which are exercisable at various prices 
in addition  we have outstanding warrants  with various strike prices  which are exercisable for a total of  shares of our common stock as of december  the options and warrants exercisable as of december  represent approximately of our issued and outstanding common stock based on the number of shares issued and outstanding as of december  on a fully diluted basis 
the exercise of our outstanding options and warrants could place downward pressure on the price of our common stock 
we are incurring significant losses and cannot assure that we will become profitable 
we incurred net losses in five out of the last six years 
for the year ended december   we incurred a net loss of  for the year ended december  we had net income of  but the results for that year included  from discontinued operations 
we cannot assure that we will become profitable or that we can maintain profitability if we attain it 
it is anticipated that we may need additional future working capital requirements in connection with pct barocycler tm sales and marketing activities as this segment of the business continues to experience lower than expected product sales since commercial launch in september associated with a longer than expected selling cycle 
management has met its recent historical cash flow needs by managing its working capital and utilizing proceeds from the february sale of one of its business segments 
we plan to manage its future liquidity needs through cost reductions and additional selling initiatives 
if revenues are lower than anticipated or expenses are higher than anticipated or if we continue to incur operating losses  we may require additional capital sooner than expected and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional financing or capital on acceptable terms or that we will be successful in eliminating or scaling back certain of our activities 
we may also need additional capital to grow both the diagnostics and biotech segments of the business 
if adequate funds are not available when needed  the company may be required to further reduce its fixed costs and delay  scale back  or eliminate certain of its activities  any of which could have a material adverse long term effect on its business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are considering various sources of additional financing  including but not limited to  sale of business segments  strategic alliances and private placements of debt or equity securities 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is subject to interest rate risk in connection with its long term debt 
the aggregate hypothetical loss in earnings for one year of those financial instruments held by the company at december   that are subject to interest rate risk resulting from a hypothetical increase in interest rates of percent is less than  after tax 
the hypothetical loss was determined by calculating the aggregate impact of a percent increase in the interest rate of each variable rate financial instrument held by the company at december   that is subject to interest rate risk 
fixed rate financial instruments were not evaluated  as the company believes the risk exposure is not material 
the company is exposed to concentrations of credit risk in cash and cash equivalents and trade receivables 
cash and cash equivalents are placed with major financial institutions with high quality credit ratings 
trade receivables credit risk exposure is significant as the company derives a significant portion of its revenues from a small number of customers 
however  this risk is mitigated by the dispersion across different industries and geographies in which the customers operate  in addition to this  approximately of consolidated revenue was from all branches of the national institutes of health  a us government agency 
the company is exposed to credit related risks associated with its trade accounts receivable from foreign customers but they are denominated in us dollars mitigating the currency risk
