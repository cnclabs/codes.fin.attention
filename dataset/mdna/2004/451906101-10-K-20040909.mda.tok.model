table of contents critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note to the consolidated financial statements in the annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended june  describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
estimates are used for  but not limited to  the accounting for the allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns  goodwill impairments  inventory allowances  warranty obligations  revenue recognition as well as loss contingencies and restructurings 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  and the results form the basis for making judgments about the reported values of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
actual results could materially differ from these estimates 
the following critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments  assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on the company s assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts and the aging of the accounts receivable 
if there is a deterioration of a customer s credit worthiness or actual defaults are higher than the historical experience  estimates of the recoverability of amounts due could be adversely affected 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was  and  at june  and  respectively 
goodwill impairments goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of the net assets of an acquired business 
the company performs a goodwill impairment assessment on an annual basis or more frequently if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events suggest an impairment exists 
the impairment test entails comparing the carrying value of goodwill to the estimated fair value of the reporting unit that the goodwill is assigned 
there are a number of significant management assumptions and estimates inherent in estimating the fair value of the reporting unit including those used to estimate future cash flows and the appropriate discount rate that incorporates the company s cost of capital and the risk profile of the cash flows 
actual cash flows may be less than those estimated by management 
a change in industry or market conditions or a downturn in the company s operations could result in a further impairment of goodwill

inventory allowances inventories are recorded at the lower of standard cost or market  which approximates actual cost on a first in first out basis  or market value 
the company writes down inventories to net realizable value based on forecasted demand and market conditions as well as the anticipated timing and impact of new product introductions 
actual demand  market conditions and timing of new product introductions may be different from those projected by management 
these differences could have a material effect on gross margins and operating results

if an increase in warranty claims are experienced  which is higher than the historical 
table of contents rate  gross margins and operating results could be adversely affected 
the warranty reserve was  and  at june  and  respectively 
revenue recognition significant management judgments and estimates are made in connection with the revenues recognized in any accounting period 
the company must assess whether the fee associated with a revenue transaction is fixed or determinable and whether or not collection is probable 
material differences could result in the amount and timing of revenues for any period if management were to make different judgments or utilize different estimates 
certain of the company s equipment sales such as its touchprint live scan systems generally require installation subsequent to shipment and transfer of title

the company adopted emerging issues task force issue no 
accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  eitf effective april  under eitf  a company must determine whether any or all of the deliverables of a multiple deliverable agreement can be separated from one another 
if separation is possible  revenue is recognized for each deliverable based on objective and reliable evidence of the fair value as the applicable revenue recognition criteria are achieved for that specific deliverable 
alternatively  if separation is not possible  revenue recognition may need to be spread evenly over the performance of all deliverables  or deferred until all elements of the arrangement have been delivered to the customer

vsoe is established based upon either sales of the element eg maintenance  training or consulting in individual transactions  or  in certain cases for maintenance  based upon substantive renewal rates 
in cases where the company does not have vsoe for all delivered elements in the transaction eg  for licenses  the fees from these multiple element agreements are allocated using the residual value method 
maintenance revenue is deferred and recognized rateably over the life of the service period of the related agreement 
revenues related to iis which was acquired in february are recognized as services are performed 
loss contingencies and restructurings the company is subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business 
the company considers the likelihood of the loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability as well as the company s ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss in determining loss contingencies 
an estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
identix regularly evaluates available current information to determine whether such reserves should be adjusted 

table of contents the company recorded reserves for the estimated cost to terminate or sublease excess facilities 
the company will continue to evaluate the commercial real estate market conditions quarterly to determine if the company s estimates of the amount and timing of future sublease income are reasonable  based on current and expected commercial real estate market conditions
