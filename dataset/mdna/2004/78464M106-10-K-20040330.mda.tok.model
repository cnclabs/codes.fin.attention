overview srs labs is a leading developer and provider of audio  voice and surround sound technology solutions  application specific integrated circuits asics and standard integrated circuits ics for the home theater  gaming  portable audio  mobile phone  computer  automotive and broadcast markets 
we operate our business through three operating units srs labs  the parent company  its wholly owned subsidiary  srswowcast 
com  inc  doing business as srswowcast technologies srswowcast  and its wholly owned subsidiary  valencetech limited  and valencetech limited s wholly owned subsidiaries collectively valence 
as discussed herein  srs labs  srs  the company  we or our means srs labs  inc and its wholly owned subsidiaries 
we operate in the following five business segments srs labs licensing our licensing segment develops and licenses audio enhancement  voice and surround sound technologies to many of the world s leading manufacturers of hardware and software products as well as semiconductor solution providers 
licensing revenues comprised   and of total consolidated revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
speaker products our product segment develops and markets consumer speaker products that incorporate proprietary audio and speaker technologies 
product revenues comprised less than of total consolidated revenues in fiscal  and srswowcast professional and consumer audio products our professional and consumer audio products segment develops and markets professional software and hardware products and consumer software plugins that incorporate proprietary audio enhancement  voice and surround sound technologies 
revenue from this segment comprised of of total consolidated revenues in fiscal and less than of total consolidated revenues in fiscal and valence semiconductor our semiconductor segment designs  develops and markets technology solutions in the form of analog and digital signal processor dsp semiconductor products or custom asic solutions to original equipment manufacturers oems around the world 
semiconductor revenues comprised  and of total consolidated revenues in fiscal   and respectively 
component distribution our component distribution segment is an authorized  non exclusive distributor of semiconductor components  subassemblies and finished goods for selected oem customers 
component distribution revenues comprised  and of total consolidated revenues in  and respectively 
we are no longer emphasizing this business due to our decision to focus on higher margin revenue and we expect future revenue to be immaterial to our total business  therefore we will not continue to break out this segment 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical and anticipated results and trends and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  including assumptions as to future events 
these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
by their nature  estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
actual results may differ from our estimates 
the following represents a summary of our critical accounting policies  defined as those policies that we believe are a the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations  and b that require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the matters that are inherently uncertain 
our most critical accounting estimates include valuation of accounts receivable  which impacts operating expenses  valuation of inventory  which impacts gross margin  valuation of intangible assets and capitalization of software  which primarily impacts operating expenses when we impair assets or accelerate their depreciation  and recognition and measurement of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities  which impacts our tax provision 
below  we discuss these policies further  as well as the estimates and judgments involved 
we also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies  such as our policies for revenue recognition  however  these policies do not meet the definition of critical accounting estimates  because they do not generally require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective 
accounts receivable we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history  the customer s current credit worthiness and various other factors  as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain allowances for doubtful accounts based upon specific customer circumstances  current economic trends  historical experience and the age of past due receivables 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
unanticipated changes in the liquidity or financial position of our customers may require additional provisions for doubtful accounts 
inventory inventory is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value 
we periodically assess our inventory for potential obsolescence and lower of cost or market issues 
we make estimates of inventory obsolescence  providing reserves when necessary  based on  among other factors  demand for inventory based on backlog  product pricing  the ability to liquidate or sell older inventory  and the impact of introducing new products 
if actual market conditions or our customer s product demands are less favorable than those projected  additional provisions may be required 
intangible assets capitalization of software in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we assess potential impairments to intangible assets when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators and future cash flows related to intangible assets are based on operational performance of our acquired businesses  market conditions and other factors 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  goodwill is considered impaired and a second test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
for fiscal  an independent valuation of goodwill and other intangibles was performed 
to date  we have not recognized any impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets in connection with our adoption of sfas however  no assurances can be given that future evaluation of goodwill will not result in charges as a result of future impairment 
costs incurred in the research  design and development of software for sale to others as a separate product or embedded in a product and sold as part of the product as a whole are charged to expense until technological feasibility is established 
under sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed  we capitalize software purchased from third parties if the related software product under development has reached technological feasibility or if there are alternative future uses for the purchased software  provided that capitalized amounts will be realized over a period not exceeding five years 
costs incurred prior to the establishment of technological feasibility are charged to research and development expense 
the establishment of technological feasibility and ongoing assessment of recoverability of capitalized software development costs require considerable judgment by management with respect to certain external factors  including  but not limited to  anticipated future revenues  estimated economic life and changes in software and hardware technologies 
upon the general release of the software product to customers  capitalization ceases and such costs are amortized to cost of sales using the straight line method on a product by product basis over the estimated life  which is generally three years 
to the extent that amounts capitalized for r d become impaired due to a decline in demand or the introduction of new technology  such amounts will be written off 
all other research and development expenditures are charged to research and development expense in the period incurred 
income taxes in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we go through a process to estimate our income taxes in each of the countries in which we operate 
the process includes an assessment of the current tax expense  the results from tax examinations and the effects of temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of transactions for tax and financial accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the consolidated balance sheet 
we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 or sfas  accounting for income taxes  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
sfas also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
we evaluate the reliability of our deferred tax assets by assessing our valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance  if necessary 
at december   we had net deferred tax assets primarily resulting from temporary differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities  and loss and credit carry forwards 
we continue to provide a valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets based on an assessment of the likelihood of their realization 
in reaching our conclusion  we evaluated certain relevant criteria including deferred tax liabilities that can be used to offset deferred tax assets  estimates of future taxable income of appropriate character within the carry forward period available under the tax law  and tax planning strategies 
our judgments regarding future taxable income may change due to market conditions  changes in us or international tax laws  and other factors 
these changes  if any  may require material adjustments to these deferred tax assets  resulting in either a tax benefit  if it is estimated that future taxable income is likely  or a reduction in the value of the deferred tax assets  if it is determined that their value is impaired  resulting in a reduction in net income or an increase in net loss in the period when such determinations are made 
our income tax provision is based on calculations and assumptions that will be subject to examination by the taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate 
should the actual results differ from our estimates  we would have to adjust the income tax provision in the period in which the facts and circumstances that give rise to the revision become known 
tax law and rate changes are reflected in the income tax provision in the period in which such changes are enacted 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain consolidated operating data as a percentage of total revenue for the years ended december    and percentage of total revenue years ended december  revenues semiconductor licensing other total revenues cost of sales gross margin operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative total operating expenses operating income loss other income  net minority interest income loss before income taxes income tax expense net income loss year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues total revenues for fiscal were  compared to  in fiscal  an increase of  or 
semiconductor revenues were  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal an increase of  or 
semiconductor sales consist of two categories a custom application specific ics asics for specific oem customers  and b standard ics marketed under the brand name  asp microelectronics asp 
the increase in semiconductor revenue in was due to expansion of valence s asic customer base  increased design wins in asic and new asp chip offerings  many of which include srs technologies 
in  asic sales accounted for and asp sales accounted for of semiconductor revenues compared to and respectively in licensing revenues were  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal  an increase of  or 
this increase was attributable to the sales growth of home entertainment products such as dvd players and portable products such as mobile phones and mp players that incorporate our technologies 
the major component of our licensing revenues is from the home theater market 
our strategy is to diversify our licensing revenue among five major markets home theater  mobile phone voice communications  portable audio  personal computer  and automotive 
although  we have started to demonstrate success in our diversification strategy in  we still expect the home theater market to continue to be a significant component of total licensing revenue 
in fiscal  of licensing revenue was derived from the home theater market which includes televisions  dvd players and set top boxes  of revenue was attributable to mobile phones and voice communications  of revenue was attributable to portable audio devices which include mp players  and the remaining was other products including pcs and car audio 
in fiscal  of licensing revenue was derived from home theater  from mobile phones and voice communications  from portable and wireless  and from other 
component distribution revenues were  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal a decrease of  or 
this decrease was due to our decision to focus on higher margin semiconductor and licensing revenues and de emphasize certain lower margin distribution activities 
product revenues were  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal a decrease of  or 
this decrease was due to the decreased on line merchandising of the srs products 
revenues generated by our internet and broadcast based business were  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal  an increase of  or 
the increase in revenues resulted from the increased sales of professional hardware equipment containing our circle surround technology to the broadcast market 
gross margin cost of sales consists primarily of fabrication costs  assembly and test costs  and the cost of materials and overhead from operations 
gross margins are dependent on the mix of products sold  services provided and royalties earned 
the gross margin percentage for fiscal increased to as a percentage of total revenues as compared to for fiscal the increase in gross margin was primarily due to a favorable mix as we focused the revenue base towards higher margin semiconductor and licensing revenues and away from lower margin component distribution 
gross margins for the semiconductor business for fiscal were compared to in semiconductor revenues accounted for of total revenues in fiscal compared to in fiscal gross margins for the licensing business for fiscal were compared to in licensing revenues accounted for of total revenues in fiscal compared to in fiscal gross margins for other revenues for fiscal were compared in other revenues accounted for of total revenues in fiscal compared to in fiscal the increase in gross margins for other revenues resulted from our shift away from the component distribution business into developing and selling professional products for the broadcast market 
we expect gross margins in to be in a range consistent with those achieved in  however  gross margins may fluctuate in future quarters depending on the mix of products sold and services provided  royalties earned  competitive pricing  new product introduction costs and other factors 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of employee related expenses  sales commissions  sales consultant fees and related expenses and product promotion costs 
for fiscal  sales and marketing expenses were  or of total revenue compared to  or of total revenue for fiscal the increase of  or is attributable primarily to investments in branding and promotion of our technologies and products in new markets designed to increase future revenues  co promotional activities with our licensees and relocation of our sales and marketing offices in hong kong 
we believe sales and marketing expenditures will continue to be a significant component of operating costs in the future to increase brand awareness and promote the adoption of our technology in new and existing markets 
whether such expenses increase or decrease  as a percentage of total revenues will be substantially dependent upon the rate at which our revenues change 
research and development research and development expenses consist of employee related expenses and expenses of consultants engaged in ongoing research  design and development activities and costs for engineering materials and supplies 
for fiscal  research and development expenses were  or of total revenue compared to  or of total revenue for fiscal the increase of  or is primarily attributable to the addition of research and development personnel in the last quarter of this increased research and development headcount has resulted in the completion of the design of several new products including wow xt for mobile technology suite 
since the personnel were substantially added in the fourth quarter of  we expect that research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars in future periods 
we expect that research and development will continue to be critical to our business as we introduce new products  but such expenses will fluctuate as a percentage of revenue due to change in sales volume 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee related expenses  legal costs associated with the administration of intellectual property  and general corporate purposes  professional fees and various other administrative costs associated with being a public company 
for fiscal  general and administrative expenses were  or of total revenue compared to  or of total revenue in fiscal the increase of  or was primarily attributable to additions to infrastructure and personnel for management of our foreign operations  increased professional fees and public company expenses 
we expect general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars in future periods as we continue to increase our associated costs  but such extremes will fluctuate as a percentage of revenues due to changes in sales volumes 
other income  net other income  net consists primarily of interest income  realized gains and losses on the sale of investments and foreign currency transaction gains and losses at valence 
other income  net was  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal  a decrease of  or 
other income  net was higher in fiscal due to realized gains on sales of investments and higher interest income earned on investment balances

selected quarterly operating results unaudited the following table sets forth certain quarterly summary financial data for the eight quarters in the period ended december  the quarterly information is based upon unaudited financial statements prepared by the company on a basis consistent with our audited consolidated financial statements and  in management s opinion  includes all adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the information for the periods presented 
this information should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
our quarterly operating results have varied significantly in the past and are expected to vary significantly in the future 
due to rounding differences  the quarters in a given year may not add precisely to the annual numbers for that year

our principal source of liquidity to fund ongoing operations at december  was cash  cash equivalents and long term investments aggregating  at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of  and investments of  cash and cash equivalents generally consist of cash  money market funds and other money market instruments with original maturities of three months or less 
investments consist of us government securities rated aaa 
as of december   cash  cash equivalents and long term investments were  compared to  as of december   an increase of net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal was  resulting primarily from an increase in accounts payable offset by increases in accounts receivable  prepaids and other assets and a decrease in accrued liabilities and income taxes payable as well as certain adjustments to reconcile net income to cash used in operating activities including depreciation and amortization and deferred income taxes 
prepaids and other assets increased from  at december  to  at december  this increase resulted from prepayments for improvements and deposits associated with our new offices in hong kong and interest receivable on investments 
accrued liabilities decreased from  at december  to  at december  due to the payment of sales commission and product promotion costs and professional fees associated with fiscal net cash used in investing activities during fiscal was  resulting primarily from the purchase of us government securities  purchases of furniture  fixtures and equipment and expenditures related to intangible assets offset by proceeds received from sales of our investments 
net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal was  reflecting the proceeds from sale of common stock pursuant to exercise of employee stock options 
working capital decreased from  at december  to  at december  the decrease of  was primarily attributable to the purchase of us government securities classified as long term investments available for sale 
we anticipate that our primary uses of working capital in future periods will be to acquire new technologies and to fund increased costs for additional sales  marketing and engineering headcounts and other marketing activities associated with the introduction of new technologies and products into the market 
based on current plans and business conditions  we expect that our cash  cash equivalents and investments  together with any amounts generated from operations  will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for at least the next months 
however  there can be no assurance that we will not be required to seek other financing sooner or that such financing  if required  will be available on terms satisfactory to the company 
contractual cash obligations and contingent liabilities and commitments we have contractual obligations and commitments with regards to operating lease arrangements

 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment to sfas no 
sfas no 
provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method on accounting for stock based employee compensation 
sfas also requires that disclosures of the pro forma effect of using the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation be displayed more prominently and in a tabular format 
additionally  sfas requires disclosures of the pro forma effect in interim financial statements 
the company has not currently adopted sfas no

factors that may affect future results we are exposed to risks in our licensing business related to product and customer concentration currently  our licensing revenue is concentrated in the home theater market with the majority of revenue generated from the inclusion of srs technology inside televisions  dvd players and set top boxes 
we expect that the consumer home entertainment market will continue to account for a significant portion of our licensing revenues for the foreseeable future 
while consumer spending in general on consumer electronic products has increased  retail prices for certain consumer electronics products that include our audio technology  such as dvd players have decreased significantly and indications are that this trend will continue for the foreseeable future 
in addition  from time to time  certain of our original equipment manufacturer and semiconductor manufacturer customers may account for a significant portion of revenue from a particular product application  such as dvd players  set top boxes or televisions 
consumer electronics products manufacturers could decide to exclude our audio enhancement technology from their home theater products altogether in an effort to reduce cost 
the loss of any such customer could have a material adverse affect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
declining prices of consumer electronic products could put pressure on our licensing fees that are charged to the manufacturers 
also  given the current economic environment  consumer spending on dvd players and other home electronic products may not increase as expected 
such declines in consumer spending  should they occur  and continued decreases in consumer product pricing for electronic goods may have a significant negative impact on our financial results 
the company s strategy is to diversify its customer base in an effort to decrease the impact from the loss of a particular customer  product segment or change in market trend 
our quarterly results may fluctuate our operating results may fluctuate from those in prior quarters and will continue to be subject to quarterly and other fluctuations due to a variety of factors  including the extent to which our licensees incorporate our technologies into their products  the timing of orders from  and the shipments to  major customers  the timing of new product introductions  the gain or loss of significant customers  competitive pressures on selling prices  the market acceptance of new or enhanced versions of our technologies  the rate that our semiconductor licensees manufacture and distribute chips to product manufacturers  and fluctuations in general economic conditions  particularly those affecting the consumer electronics market 
due to our dependence on the consumer electronics market  the substantial seasonality of sales in the market could impact our revenues and net income 
in particular  we believe that there is seasonality relating to the christmas season generally and the chinese new year within the asia region  which fall into the fourth and first quarters respectively 
as a result  we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied on as indications of future performance 
we rely on revenue contribution from our asic and standard ic business we derive a significant amount of our revenue from valence s asic business 
valence s engineering team focuses on the design of custom asics to meet specific customers requirements and outsources the production of the design to mask houses  foundries and packaging houses located primarily in asia 
the operations of valence could be affected by a variety of factors  including the timing of customer orders  the timing of development revenue  changes in the mix of products distributed and the mix of distribution channels employed  the emergence of a new industry standard  product obsolescence and changes in pricing policies by the company  its competitors or its suppliers 
business revenue from asics is concentrated in a limited number of customers in the areas of consumer electronics  communications products  computers and computer peripherals 
the business generated from any one customer may be for a fixed length or quantity 
as such  it is customary in our asic business to have a certain amount of customer turnover as new asic projects are obtained for different customers 
however  it is possible that the loss of any particular customer or any bad debt arising from such customer may have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operation 
beginning in fiscal  valence began to exit from certain lower margin product offerings in the distribution side of the business and has placed more emphasis on developing and distributing products that are related to or incorporate our proprietary technologies 
as a result  the immediate loss in revenue of the low margin distribution business will not be entirely offset by the new proprietary technology based products  which will take time to develop and be introduced into the marketplace 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to quickly introduce new products to offset the loss in revenue or that the new products developed will receive a favorable market acceptance 
valence adds significant diversity to our overall business structure and opportunities 
we recognize that in the presence of such corporate diversity  and in particular with regard to the semiconductor industry  there will always exist a potential for a conflict among sales channels between the company and our technology licensees 
although the operations of our licensing business and those of valence are generally complementary  there can be no assurances that sales channel conflicts will not arise 
if such potential conflicts do materialize  we may or may not be able to mitigate the effect of such perceived conflicts  which  if not resolved  may impact the results of operations 
we are exposed to risks in our valence business related to product fabrication outsourcing to third parties valence is a fabless semiconductor company meaning that valence designs  develops and markets our selection of custom and standard integrated circuits but we rely on third party contractors to manufacture  assemble and test our products 
although we believe our relationships are generally good  we do not have long term supply agreements with our third party vendors and they are not obligated to perform services or supply products to us for any particular period or in any particular quantities  except as provided in each separate purchase order accepted by them 
although we have not experienced an unavailability of capacity  the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry could result in capacity limitations 
also  particularly in times of high demand  our third party vendors may reallocate capacity to other customers in a manner adverse to us 
accordingly  there are significant risks associated with our reliance on third party vendors including capacity shortages  potential price increases  delays and interruptions in order deliveries  reduced control over product quality and increased risk of misappropriation of intellectual property 
we have a new business model for our srswowcast broadcast and internet business in fiscal  we launched our srswowcast subsidiary to focus on opportunities in the internet space 
in fiscal  srswowcast commenced operations with a business plan which focused on developing and acquiring audio based content to attract visitor traffic to its website in order to sell advertising and e commerce products 
in  we revised our strategy to focus on the sale and licensing of software and hardware products incorporating our audio and voice enhancement technology solutions 
there can be no assurance that this new business model will develop a sufficient customer base to be able to generate meaningful revenue 
in  srswowcast introduced a variety of audio processing hardware and software products to the professional audio markets for the encoding and broadcasting of content in srs circle surround technology 
there can be no assurance that this new business model or that the circle surround technology will develop a sufficient customer base to be able to generate meaningful revenue 
we are exposed to certain risks in producing professional and consumer products we intend to continue to develop and offer high end audio enhancement products  including professional and consumer hardware and software products 
we have also developed a line of speakers that incorporate proprietary flat panel designs  which have been marketed to oems and industry retail buyers 
there can be no assurance that our products will be accepted in the market or that we will be able to develop an effective distribution channel and build acceptable brand recognition as a product manufacturer 
as the business increases  it is anticipated that significant capital will be required to finance product inventory and accounts receivable 
as a result  we are subject to risks of product obsolescence  bad debt and insufficient finance to grow the business 
we also recognize that as we develop and market new consumer audio products  there will always exist a potential for conflict and competition between srs labs and our technology licensees 
although our intended products and those of our licensees do not generally overlap  there can be no assurances that our products will not compete with those of our licensees 
if such conflicts do materialize  it is uncertain whether we will be able to mitigate the effect of such conflicts  which  if not resolved  may adversely impact our business and results of operations 
we conduct operations in a number of countries and are subject to risks of international operations  particularly in asia and the prc we have significant operations in hong kong  the prc and other parts of asia that require refinement to adapt to the changing market conditions in that region 
our operations in asia  and international operations in general  are subject to risks of unexpected changes in  or impositions of  legislative or regulatory requirements 
our customers geographically located in the asia pacific markets accounted for approximately  and of total company sales in  and  respectively and are expected to continue to account for a substantial percentage of sales in the future 
the economic climate in asia continues to be impacted by increases in unemployment  declines in consumer spending  currency devaluation and bank failures 
any of these factors  should they continue  could significantly reduce the demand for the end user goods in which our products and technologies are used 
the prc economy has experienced significant growth in the past decade  but such growth has been uneven across geographic and economic sectors 
there can be no assurance that such growth will continue or that any potential currency devaluation in the region will not have a negative effect on our business  including valence 
the prc economy has also experienced deflation in the past  which may continue in the future 
the current economic situation may adversely affect our profitability over time as expenditures for consumer electronics products and information technology may decrease due to the results of slowing domestic demand and deflation 
hong kong is a special administrative region of the prc with its own government and legislature 
hong kong enjoys a high degree of autonomy from the prc under the principle of one country  two systems 
we can give no assurance that hong kong will continue to enjoy autonomy from the prc 
the hong kong dollar has remained relatively constant due to the us dollar peg and currency board system that has been in effect in hong kong since since mid  interest rates in hong kong have fluctuated significantly and real estate and retail sales have declined 
we can give no assurance that the hong kong economy will not worsen or that the historical currency peg of the hong kong dollar to the us dollar will be maintained 
continued declining consumer spending in hong kong  deflation or the discontinuation of the currency peg could adversely affect our business 
we are exposed to currency fluctuations and instability in the asian markets we expect that international sales will continue to represent a significant portion of our total revenues 
to date  all of our licensing revenues have been denominated in us dollars and most costs have been incurred in us dollars 
it is our expectation that licensing revenues will continue to be denominated in us dollars for the foreseeable future 
because valence and their subsidiaries business is primarily focused in asia and because of our anticipated expansion of business in the prc and other parts of asia  our consolidated results of operations and financial position could be significantly affected by risks associated with international activities  including economic and labor conditions  political instability  tax laws including us taxes on foreign subsidiaries and changes in the value of the us dollar versus the local currency in which the products are sold 
in addition  our valuation of assets recorded as a result of the valence acquisition may also be adversely impacted by the currency fluctuations relative to the us dollar 
we intend to actively monitor our foreign exchange exposure and to implement strategies to reduce its foreign exchange risk at such time that we determine the benefits of such strategies outweigh the associated costs 
however  there is no guarantee that we will take steps to insure against such risks  and should such risks occur  there is no guarantee that we will not be significantly impacted 
countries in the asia pacific region have experienced weakness in their currency  banking and equity markets 
these weaknesses could adversely affect consumer demand for valence s products  the us dollar value of the company s and its subsidiaries foreign currency denominated sales  the availability and supply of product components to valence and ultimately  our consolidated results of operations 
we are subject to competitive pressures our existing and potential competitors include both large and emerging domestic and international companies that have substantially greater financial  manufacturing  technical  marketing  distribution and other resources 
present or future competitors may be able to develop products and technologies comparable or superior to ours  and to adapt more quickly than us to new technologies or evolving market needs 
we believe that the competitive factors affecting the market for our products and technologies include product performance  price and quality  product functionality and features  the ease of integration  and implementation of the products and technologies with other hardware and software components in the oem s products 
in addition  the markets in which we compete are intensely competitive and are characterized by rapid technological changes  declining average sales prices and rapid product obsolescence 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to compete effectively in its respective markets  that competition will not intensify or that future competition will not have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  cash flows and financial condition 
we strongly rely on our intellectual property our ability to compete may be affected by our ability to protect our proprietary information 
we have filed numerous us and foreign patent applications and to date have a number of issued us and foreign patents covering various aspects of our technologies 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by srs labs to protect our intellectual property will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology or that our competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology 
in addition  the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the us the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims and litigation regarding patent and other property rights 
we are not currently a party to any claims of this nature 
there can be no assurances that third parties will not assert claims or initiate litigation against the company or our customers with respect to existing or future products 
in addition  we may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to determine the scope and validity of our proprietary rights 
we depend on our executive officers and other key personnel our future success depends to a large extent upon the continued service of our executives  as well as key engineering  sales  and marketing staff  including highly skilled semiconductor design personnel 
we anticipate that any future growth will require us to recruit and hire a number of new personnel in engineering  operations  finance  sales and marketing 
competition for such personnel during times of economic growth is intense  and there can be no assurance that we can recruit and retain necessary personnel to operate its business and support future growth 
the market price of our common stock is volatile the trading price of our common stock has been  and will likely continue to be  subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarterly variations in our operating results  announcements of new products or technological innovations by the company or our competitors  strategic alliances between srs labs and third parties  general market fluctuations and other events and factors 
changes in earnings estimates made by brokerage firms and industry analysts relating to the markets in which we do business  or relating to the company specifically  have in the past resulted in  and could in the future result in  an immediate and adverse effect on the market price of the common stock 
even though our stock is quoted on the nasdaq stock market  our stock has had and may continue to have low trading volume and high volatility 
the historically low trading volume of our stock makes it more likely that a severe fluctuation in volume  either up or down  will significantly impact the stock price 
since our shares are thinly traded  our shareholders may have difficulty selling our common stock 
we may encounter difficulties with acquisitions  which could harm our business from time to time  we expect to make acquisitions of businesses or technologies that are complementary to our business strategy 
such future acquisitions would expose the company to risks commonly encountered in acquisitions of businesses 
such risks include  among others  difficulty of assimilating the operations  information systems and personnel of the acquired business es  the potential disruption of our ongoing business  and the inability of management to maximize the financial and strategic position of the company through successful incorporation of the acquired technologies  employees and customers 
there can be no assurance that any potential acquisition will be consummated or  if consummated  that it will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a variety of risks  including foreign currency fluctuations and changes in interest rates affecting investment earnings 
foreign currency international sales represent a significant portion of our total revenues 
to date  all of our licensing revenues have been denominated in us dollars and most costs have been incurred in us dollars 
we have subsidiary operations in hong kong and customers in the prc  and  accordingly  we are exposed to transaction gains and losses that could result from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
we use the local currency hong kong dollars as the functional currency for our valence subsidiaries 
the hong kong dollar has remained relatively constant due to the us dollar peg and currency board system that has been in effect in hong kong since to date  most of our semiconductor revenue and expenses incurred have been denominated in hong kong dollars 
translation adjustments resulting from the process of translating foreign currency financial statements into us dollars were not significant in fiscal   and cash balances maintained by valence in excess of normal operating requirements are invested in us denominated bank accounts further reducing balance sheet exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
under the current circumstances  we believe that the foreign currency market risk is not material  however  we can give no assurance that the hong kong economy will not worsen or that the historical currency peg of the hong kong dollar to the us dollar will be maintained 
we actively monitor our foreign exchange exposure and  should circumstances change  intend to implement strategies to reduce our risk at such time that it determines that the benefits of such strategies outweigh the associated costs 
there can be no assurance that management s efforts to reduce foreign exchange exposure will be successful 
interest rates our exposure to market risk includes changes in interest rates  which relates primarily to our invested balances of cash  cash equivalents and investments 
our investment policy specifies excess funds are to be invested in a manner that preserves capital  provides liquidity and generates the highest available after tax return 
to limit exposure to market risk  we place our cash in banks  cash equivalents in high quality  short term commercial paper and money market funds and investments consisting of us government securities and u 
s government backed securities 
we do not invest in any derivative instruments 
all cash  cash equivalents and investments are carried at fair value  which approximates cost
