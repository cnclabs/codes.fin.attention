because long term contracts are not a significant part of the company s business  future results cannot be reliably predicted by considering past trends or extrapolating past results 
critical accounting policies as described below  the company s most critical accounting policies are those that involve subjective decisions  assessments or estimates 
accounts receivable allowances 
the company maintains accounts receivable allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
estimates used in determining the accounts receivable allowances were based on current trends and historical loss statistics 
actual results may differ from these estimates  which may materially affect the company s future financial results 
income tax assets and liabilities 
in establishing its deferred income tax assets and liabilities  the company makes judgments and interpretations based on the enacted tax laws and published tax guidance that are applicable to its operations 
the company records deferred tax assets and liabilities and evaluates the need for valuation allowances to reduce the deferred tax assets to realizable amounts 
the likelihood of a material change in the company s expected realization of these assets is dependent on future taxable income  its ability to use foreign tax credit carryforwards and carrybacks  final us and foreign tax settlements  and the effectiveness of its tax planning strategies in the various relevant jurisdictions 
while management believes that its judgments and interpretations regarding deferred income tax assets and liabilities are appropriate  significant differences in actual experience may materially affect the future financial results of the company 
employee retirement plans 
the determination of the company s obligations for certain employee retirement plans is dependent upon various assumptions  including  among others  discount rates and service periods 
management believes its assumptions are appropriate  however significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect the company s future financial results 
goodwill impairment 
in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  the company assesses the impairment of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets annually  or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
this assessment is based upon a discounted cash flow analysis 
the estimate of cash flow is based upon  among other things  certain assumptions about expected future operating performance and an appropriate discount rate determined by management 
the company s estimates of discounted cash flow may differ from actual cash flow due to  among other things  economic conditions  changes to its business model or changes in its operating performance 
significant differences between these estimates and actual cash flow could materially affect the future financial results of the company 
the company completed its annual goodwill impairment test during the year ended december  and determined that no adjustment to the carrying value of goodwill was required 
workers compensation 
the company self insures or retains a portion of the exposure for losses related to workers compensation 
the company has established reserves for workers compensation claims based on historical loss statistics and periodic independent actuarial valuations 
while management believes that its assumptions and estimates are appropriate  significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect the company s future financial results

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations 
the company s exposure to foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to the company s foreign subsidiaries 
exchange rates impact the us dollar value of the company s reported earnings  investments in its foreign subsidiaries  and the intercompany transactions with its foreign subsidiaries 
for  approximately of the company s revenues were generated outside of the united states 
these operations transact business in their functional currency 
as a result  fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies against the us dollar have an impact on the company s reported results 
revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are translated into us dollars at the monthly average exchange rates prevailing during the period 
consequently  as the value of the us dollar changes relative to the currencies of the company s non us markets  the company s reported results vary 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates impact the us dollar amount of the company s stockholders equity 
the assets and liabilities of the company s non us subsidiaries are translated into non us dollars at the exchange rates in effect at year end 
the resulting translation adjustments are recorded in stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss
