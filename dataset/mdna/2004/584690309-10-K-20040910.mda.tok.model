certain information contained in the discussion and analysis set forth below and elsewhere in this report  including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing  includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
see risk factors that may affect future results in item in this form k for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward looking statements in this report 
our md a is composed of four major sections  executive summary  results of operations  liquidity and capital resources and critical accounting policies and estimates 
executive summary we are a leading specialty pharmaceutical company focusing primarily on helping patients attain a healthy and youthful appearance and self image through the development and marketing of products in the united states for the treatment of dermatological  aesthetic and podiatric conditions in the united states and canada 
we offer a broad range of products addressing various conditions  including acne  fungal infections  rosacea  hyperpigmentation  photoaging  psoriasis  eczema  skin and skin structure infections  seborrheic dermatitis and cosmesis improvement in the texture and appearance of skin 
our current product franchises are divided between the dermatological and non dermatological fields 
the dermatological field represents products for the treatment of acne and acne related dermatological conditions and non acne dermatological conditions 
the non dermatological field represents products for the treatment of asthma until may and urea cycle disorder 
the acne and acne related dermatological product lines include core brands dynacin  plexion and triaz 
the non acne dermatological product lines include core brands loprox  omnicef and restylane 
the non dermatological product lines include buphenyl and orapred  which was one of the company s core brands until it was licensed to biomarin in may key aspects of our business we derive a majority of our prescription volume from our core prescription products 
we believe that the prescription volume of our core prescription products and sales of our dermal aesthetic product  restylane  which we began selling in the united states on january   will constitute the majority of our sales for the foreseeable future 
we have built our business by executing a four part growth strategy 
this strategy consists of promoting existing core brands  developing new products and important product line extensions  entering into strategic collaborations  and acquiring complementary products  technologies and businesses 
as a result of customer buying patterns  a substantial portion of our revenues has been recognized in the last month of each quarter 
we schedule our inventory purchases to meet anticipated customer demand 
as a result  relatively small delays in the receipt of manufactured products by us could result in revenues being deferred or lost 
our operating expenses are based upon anticipated sales levels  and a high percentage of our operating expenses are relatively fixed in the short term 
consequently  variations in the timing of revenue recognition could cause significant fluctuations in operating results from period to period and may result in unanticipated periodic earnings shortfalls or losses 
we estimate customer demand for our prescription products primarily through use of third party syndicated data sources which track prescriptions written by health care providers and dispensed by licensed pharmacies 
these data are extrapolations from information provided only by certain pharmacies and are estimates of historical demand levels 
we observe trends from these data  and  coupled with certain proprietary information  prepare demand 
table of contents forecasts that are the basis for purchase orders for finished and component inventory from our third party manufacturers and suppliers 
our forecasts may fail to accurately anticipate ultimate customer demand for products 
overestimates of demand may result in excessive inventory production  underestimates may result in inadequate supply of our products in channels of distribution 
we sell our products primarily to major wholesalers and retail pharmacy chains 
consistent with pharmaceutical industry patterns  approximately of our revenues are derived from four major drug wholesale concerns 
while we attempt to estimate inventory levels of our products at our major wholesale customers  using historical prescription information and historical purchase patterns  this process is inherently imprecise 
rarely do wholesale customers provide us complete inventory levels at regional distribution centers  or within their national distribution systems 
we rely wholly upon our wholesale and drug chain customers to effect the distribution allocation of our products 
based upon historically consistent purchasing patterns of our major wholesale customers  we believe our estimates of trade inventory levels of our products are reasonable 
we further believe that inventories of our products among wholesale customers  taken as a whole  are similar to those of other specialty pharmaceutical companies  and that our trade practices  which periodically involve volume discounts and early payment discounts  are typical of the industry 
we periodically offer promotions to wholesale and chain drugstore customers to encourage dispensing of our products  consistent with prescriptions written by licensed health care providers 
because many of our products compete in multi source markets  it is important for us to ensure the licensed healthcare providers dispensing instructions are fulfilled with our branded products and are not substituted with a generic product or another therapeutic alternative product which may be contrary to the licensed health care providers recommended and prescribed medicis brand 
we believe that a critical component of our brand protection program is maintenance of full product availability at drugstore and wholesale customers 
we believe such availability strongly reduces the probability of local and regional product substitutions  shortages and backorders  which could result in lost sales 
we expect to continue providing favorable terms to wholesale and retail drug chain customers as may be necessary to ensure the fullest possible distribution of our branded products within the pharmaceutical chain of commerce 
we cannot control or influence greatly the purchasing patterns of our wholesale and retail drug chain customers 
these are highly sophisticated customers that purchase products in a manner consistent with their industry practices and  presumably  based upon their projected demand levels 
purchases by any given customer  during any given period  may be above or below actual prescription volumes of any of our products during the same period  resulting in fluctuations of product inventory in the distribution channel 
the following significant events and transactions occurred during fiscal and affected our results of operations  our cash flows and our financial condition launch of restylane in the united states following approval by the fda licensing of orapred to biomarin sale of products to taro pharmaceuticals usa  inc taro exchange of our contingent convertible senior notes launch of restylane in the united states following approval by the fda in march  we acquired from q med the exclusive us and canadian rights to market  distribute and commercialize the dermal restorative product lines known as restylane  perlane and restylane fine lines 
we paid million upon closing of the transaction  million in december upon fda approval of restylane  million in may upon certain cumulative commercial milestones being achieved and will pay approximately million upon fda approval of perlane 
restylane  perlane and restylane fine lines had previously been approved for use in canada  and on december   the fda approved restylane for use in the united states 
on january   we began commercial sales of restylane in the united states 
this was an important event for us as it represented our entrance into the dermal aesthetics market in the us  a market that we had invested a significant amount of resources in preparation of entering 
in addition to the license fee and milestone payments paid to q med for the exclusive rights to the products  we invested incremental costs associated with the hiring of a dedicated aesthetics 
table of contents sales force  additional headquarters personnel to support sales force efforts  including product management  customer service and training personnel  expenses associated with public relations  physician training and continuing medical education  and other administrative expenses 
we believe the dermal aesthetics market will be an integral part of our business for the foreseeable future 
on june   the itc instituted an investigation pursuant to section of the tariff act of  as amended  at the request of inamed 
the investigation identifies medicis aesthetics inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of medicis  and q med as respondents in the investigation regarding inamed s allegation of infringement of its us patent no 
 dated february   by the dermal filler  restylane 
inamed has filed a parallel infringement action against medicis and q med in the us district court of the southern district of california regarding the same patent 
this action has been stayed pending the outcome of the itc investigation 
after a preliminary investigation regarding the above complaints  it is our belief that we have meritorious defenses as to the infringement claims and as to the validity of the inamed patent 
licensing of orapred to biomarin on may   we closed an asset purchase agreement and license agreement and executed a securities purchase agreement with biomarin 
the asset purchase agreement involves biomarin s purchase of assets related to orapred  including assets concerning the ascent field sales force 
orapred and related pediatric intellectual property is owned by ascent  a wholly owned subsidiary of medicis 
the license agreement grants biomarin the exclusive worldwide rights to orapred  including proprietary taste masking technologies and related development technologies 
the securities purchase agreement grants biomarin the option to purchase all outstanding shares of common stock of ascent  based on certain conditions 
as part of the transaction  the name ascent pediatrics  inc was changed to medicis pediatrics  inc under terms of the agreements  biomarin will make license payments to ascent of approximately million payable over a five year period as follows approximately million as of the date of the transaction  approximately million per quarter for four quarters beginning in july  approximately million per quarter for the subsequent four quarters beginning in july  approximately million per quarter for the subsequent eight quarters beginning in july  and approximately million per quarter for the last four quarters of the five year period beginning in july biomarin will also make payments of million per quarter for six quarters beginning in july for reimbursement of certain contingent payments as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
the license agreement will terminate in july at that time  based on certain conditions  biomarin will have the option to purchase all outstanding shares of ascent for approximately million 
the payment will consist of million in cash and million in biomarin common stock  based on the fair value of the stock at that time 
as of the closing date of the transaction  biomarin is responsible for all marketing and promotional efforts regarding the sale of orapred 
as a result  we no longer advertise or promote any oral liquid prednisolone sodium phosphate solution product or any related line extension 
we have the responsibility for the manufacture and delivery of finished goods inventory to biomarin  and biomarin will be responsible for paying us for future finished goods inventory delivered by us through june  during the term of the license agreement  we will maintain ownership of the intellectual property and  consequently  will continue to amortize the related intangible assets 
payments received from biomarin under the license agreement are treated as contract revenue  which is included in net revenues in our consolidated statements of income

exchange of contingent convertible senior notes on august   we exchanged approximately million in principal amount of our contingent convertible senior notes due the old notes for approximately million in principal amount of our contingent convertible senior notes due the new notes 
holders of old notes that accepted our exchange offer received  in principal amount of new notes for each  in principal amount of old notes 
the terms of the new notes are similar to the terms of the old notes  but have a different interest rate  conversion rate and maturity date 
holders of old notes that chose not to exchange continue to be subject to the terms of the old notes 
the new notes bear interest at a rate of per annum  which is payable on june and december of each year  beginning december  we will also pay contingent interest at a rate of per annum during any six month period  with the initial six month period commencing june   if the average trading price of the new notes reaches certain thresholds 
the new notes mature on june  we may redeem some or all of the new notes at any time on or after june   at a redemption price  payable in cash  of of the principal amount of the new notes  plus accrued and unpaid interest

the new notes are convertible  at the holders option  prior to the maturity date into shares of our class a common stock in the following circumstances during any quarter commencing after september   if the closing price of our class a common stock over a specified number of trading days during the previous quarter  including the last trading day of each quarter  is more than of the conversion price of the new notes  or 
the notes are initially convertible at a conversion price of per share  which is equal to a conversion rate of approximately shares per  principal amount of new notes  subject to adjustment  if we have called the new notes for redemption  during the five trading day period immediately following any nine consecutive day trading period in which the trading price of the new notes per  principal amount for each day of such period was less than of the product of the closing sale price of our class a common stock on that day multiplied by the number of shares of our class a common stock issuable upon conversion of  principal amount of the new notes  or upon the occurrence of specified corporate transactions 
the new notes  which are unsecured  do not contain any restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness or the repurchase of our securities and do not contain any financial covenants 
the new notes require an adjustment to the conversion price if cash dividends of more than per quarter after giving effect to the stock split described in note to our consolidated financial statements are paid by us on our outstanding common stock

we incurred approximately million of fees and other 
table of contents origination costs related to the issuance of the new notes 
we are amortizing these costs over the five year put period  which runs through august unless a conversion contingency is met  the shares underlying the remaining old notes and new notes are not included in the calculation of fully diluted earnings per share 
should a contingency be met  earnings per share would be expected to decrease as a result of the inclusion of the underlying shares in the earnings per share calculation 
volatility in our stock price could cause a contingency to be met in one quarter and not in a subsequent quarter  increasing the volatility of fully diluted earnings per share

we have no special purpose or limited purpose entities that provided off balance sheet financing  liquidity or market or credit risk support  engage in leasing  hedging  research and development services  or other relationships that expose us to liability that is not reflected on the face of the financial statements 
see note of the financial statements regarding our lease commitments and other commitments 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at june   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
this table excludes amounts already recorded on our balance sheet as current liabilities at june  or certain other purchase obligations as discussed below in thousands payments due by period less than more than total year years years years long term debt operating leases other purchase obligations and commitments total contractual obligations other purchase obligations and commitments include payments due under research and development and consulting contracts 
purchase orders for raw materials  finished goods and other goods and services are not included in the above table 
we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations  as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
for the purpose of this table  contractual obligations for purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
our purchase orders are based on our current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors with relatively short timetables 
we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or finished goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our short term expected requirements 
we also enter into contracts for outsourced services  however  the obligations under these contracts were not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty 
the expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information 
timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed upon amounts for some obligations 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates related to sales allowances  chargebacks  rebates  returns and other pricing adjustments  depreciation and amortization and other contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on 
table of contents historical experience and various other factors related to each circumstance 
actual results could differ from those estimates based upon future events  which could include  among other risks  changes in the regulations governing the manner in which we sell our products  changes in the health care environment and managed care consumption patterns 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our most significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and are important in understanding our financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition revenue from product sales is recognized when the merchandise is shipped to an unrelated third party pursuant to staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
accordingly  revenue is recognized when all four of the following criteria are met i persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  ii delivery of the products has occurred  iii the selling price is both fixed and determinable  and iv collectibility is reasonably assured 
our customers consist primarily of large pharmaceutical wholesalers who sell directly into the retail channel 
provisions for early payment discounts  and estimates for chargebacks  managed care and medicaid rebates  damaged product returns  exchanges for expired product are established as a reduction of product sales revenues at the time such revenues are recognized 
these revenue reductions are established by us as our best estimate at the time of sale based on historical experience adjusted to reflect known changes in the factors that impact such reserves 
these revenue reductions are generally reflected either as a direct reduction to accounts receivable through an allowance  or as an addition to accrued expenses if the payment is due to a party other than the wholesale or retail customer 
we enter into licensing arrangements with other parties whereby we receive contract revenue based on the terms of the agreement 
the timing of revenue recognition is dependent on the level of our continuing involvement in the manufacture and delivery of licensed products 
if we have continuing involvement  the revenue is deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the period of continuing involvement 
in addition  if our licensing arrangements require no continuing involvement and payments are merely based on the passage of time  we will assess such payments for revenue recognition under the collectibility criteria of sab we do not provide any forms of price protection to our wholesale customers and permit product returns only if the product is damaged or if it is returned within six to months of expiration and the customer is committed to accepting replacement product in exchange 
our customers consist principally of financially viable wholesalers  so  revenue is recorded upon sale to the wholesaler  net of estimated provisions 
if the levels of chargebacks  managed care and medicaid rebates  damaged product returns and exchanges for expired products fluctuate significantly and or if our estimates do not adequately reserve for these reductions of net product revenues  our reported net product revenues could be negatively affected 
accounts receivable are presented net of allowances related to the above provisions of approximately million and million at june  and june   respectively 
goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets we have in the past made acquisitions of products and businesses that include goodwill  license agreements  product rights  and other identifiable intangible assets 
we assess the impairment of goodwill and other identifiable intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
some factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following i significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  ii significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and iii significant negative industry or economic trends 
when we determine that the carrying value of goodwill and other identifiable intangibles may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we first will perform an assessment of the asset s recoverability based on expected undiscounted future net cash flow and  if the amount is 
table of contents less than the asset s value  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we do not amortize goodwill 
in lieu of amortization  we are required to perform an impairment review of goodwill on an annual basis 
if we determine through the impairment process that goodwill has been impaired  we would record the impairment charge in our statement of income 
as a result of our acquisitions  we included approximately million and million of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheets as of june  and june   respectively 
as a result of our acquisitions of product rights and other identifiable intangible assets  we have included approximately million and million as net intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheets as of june  and june   respectively 
estimated amortization expense for intangible assets as of june  for each of the five succeeding fiscal years is approximately million 
income taxes income taxes are determined using an annual effective tax rate  which is generally less than the us federal statutory rate  primarily because of tax exempt interest  charitable contribution deductions and research and experimentation tax credits available in the united states 
our effective tax rate may be subject to fluctuations during the fiscal year as new information is obtained which may affect the assumptions we use to estimate our annual effective tax rate  including factors such as our mix of pre tax earnings in the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate  valuation allowances against deferred tax assets  reserves for tax audit issues and settlements  utilization of research and experimentation tax credits and changes in tax laws in jurisdictions where we conduct operations 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities 
we record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets to reduce the net carrying value to an amount that management believes is more likely than not to be realized 
deferred income taxes are presented net of a valuation allowance of approximately million as of june  and june  managed care and medicaid reserves we establish and maintain reserves for amounts payable by us to managed care organizations and state medicaid programs for the reimbursement of portions of the retail price of prescriptions filled that are covered by the respective programs 
the amounts estimated to be paid relating to products sold are recognized as revenue reductions and as additions to accrued expenses at the time of sale based on our best estimate of the expected prescription fill rate to these managed care and state medicaid patients  using historical experience adjusted to reflect known changes in the factors that impact such reserves 
if the levels of managed care and medicaid rebates fluctuate significantly and or if our estimates do not adequately reserve for these reductions of net product revenues  our reported net product revenues could be negatively affected 
accrued liabilities include reserves of approximately million and million at june  and june   respectively  for estimated managed care and medicaid rebates 
research and development costs and accounting for strategic collaborations all research and development costs  including payments related to products under development and research consulting agreements  are expensed as incurred 
we may continue to make up front  non refundable payments to third parties for new technologies and for research and development work that has been completed 
these up front payments may be expensed at the time of payment depending on the nature of the payment made 

table of contents our policy on accounting for costs of strategic collaborations determines the timing of our recognition of certain development costs 
in addition  this policy determines whether the cost is classified as development expense or capitalized as an asset 
we are required to form judgments with respect to the commercial status of such products in determining whether development costs meet the criteria for immediate expense or capitalization 
for example  when we acquire certain products for which there is already an anda or nda available  and there is net realizable value based on projected sales for these products  we capitalize the amount paid as an intangible asset 
in addition  if we acquire product rights that are in the development phase and as to which we have no assurance that the third party is required to perform additional research efforts  we expense such payments 
during fiscal and fiscal  we incurred and expensed approximately million and million  respectively  of up front or development milestone payments related to research and development collaborations 
effects of recently issued accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
 which addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities vies either that do not have sufficient equity investment at risk to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support  or in which the equity investors lack an essential characteristic of a controlling financial interest 
in december  the fasb completed deliberations of proposed modifications to fin revised interpretations resulting in multiple effective dates based on the nature as well as the creation date of the vie 
vies created after january   but prior to january   may be accounted for either based on the original interpretation or the revised interpretations 
for vies created or acquired prior to february   the provisions of fin must be applied for the first interim or annual period ending after december  certain disclosures are effective immediately 
vies created after january  must be accounted for under the revised interpretations 
we currently have no contractual relationship or other business relationship with a variable interest entity  and  therefore  the adoption of fin no 
did not have any effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in april  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no

 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
this statement requires that certain instruments that were previously classified as equity on a company s statement of financial position now be classified as liabilities 
the statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and to all other instruments that exist as of the beginning of the first interim financial reporting period beginning after june  we have no instruments impacted by the adoption of this statement  and  therefore  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have any effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in march  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on eitf  participating securities and the two class method under fasb statement no 
 earnings per share 
eitf provides guidance about how to determine whether a security should be considered a participating security for purposes of computing earnings per share and how earnings or losses should be allocated to a participating security when using the two class method for computing basic earnings per share 
the provisions of eitf are effective for reporting periods beginning after march   and must be applied by restating previously reported earnings per share amounts 
we have no securities considered to be participating securities and therefore the adoption did not 
table of contents have any effect on our consolidated financial statements 
at the july meeting  the eitf began discussing issue  accounting issues related to certain features of contingently convertible debt and the effect on diluted earnings per share  and the accounting for contingently convertible debt instruments  commonly referred to as cocos 
cocos combine the features of contingently issuable shares with a convertible debt instrument 
these instruments generally become convertible into common stock only if one or more specified events occurs  such as the underlying common stock achieving a specified price target 
under current interpretations of fasb statement no 
 earnings per share  issuers of cocos exclude the potential common shares underlying the coco from the calculation of diluted earnings per share until the market price or other contingency is met 
when the contingency is met  generally the if converted method is used to calculate the dilutive impact of the instrument 
under the if converted method  the instrument is considered converted  with the resulting number of shares included in the denominator of the earnings per share calculation and the interest expense net of tax added back to the numerator of the earnings per share calculation 
while a traditional convertible debt instrument may dilute earnings per share right away application of the if converted method is required even if the conversion option is out of the money  current accounting practice for cocos avoids this dilution until a specified contingency is met the disclosure requirements associated with these instruments were recently clarified by the fasb in fsp  disclosure requirements under fasb statement no 
 disclosure of information about capital structure  relating to contingently convertible securities 
this aspect of the accounting for cocos is a significant aspect of their attractiveness to issuers 
the eitf reached a tentative conclusion that the contingently issuable shares guidance in statement does not apply to convertible debt 
as a result  the dilutive effect of contingently convertible debt should be included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share immediately upon issuance of the instrument generally using the if converted method 
this represents a significant change in practice and will affect hundreds of issuers 
the task force tentatively concluded that its conclusion would be applied by retroactively restating earnings per share 
the tentative conclusion will be posted to the fasb s website for public comment 
as the accounting rules related to this issue have yet to be determined  the impact has not been reflected in our consolidated financial statements 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to interest rate fluctuations on our short term investments that are comprised of us corporate securities and other debt securities that we hold on an available for sale basis 
changes in interest rates do not affect interest expense incurred on our contingent convertible senior notes as the interest rate is fixed 
we have not entered into derivative financial instruments 

table of contents the following table provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
for our investment portfolio  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average yield rates by expected maturity dates 
additionally  we have assumed our available for sale securities are similar enough to aggregate for presentation purposes 
interest rate sensitivity principal amount by expected maturity as of june  amounts in thousands financial instruments mature during fiscal year ended june  thereafter available for sale securities weighted average yield rate contingent convertible senior notes due interest rate contingent convertible senior notes due interest rate we have minimal operations outside of the united states and  accordingly  we have not been susceptible to significant risk from changes in foreign currencies 
during the normal course of business we could be subjected to a variety of market risks  examples of which include  but are not limited to  interest rate movements and foreign currency fluctuations  as we discussed above  and collectibility of accounts receivable 
we continuously assess these risks and have established policies and procedures to protect against the adverse effects of these and other potential exposures 
although we do not anticipate any material losses in these risk areas  no assurance can be made that material losses will not be incurred in these areas in the future
