item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
executive overview we view as a transitional year for the economy and the staffing industry 
the first half of the year was marked by sporadic economic improvement and a weak labor market 
it wasn t until late in the year that global economic conditions began to improve and signaled a sustainable job creating recovery 
concurrent with this  the demand for temporary staffing also began to show real strength 
in  our revenues increased to billion 
this was a new record and was almost million above the previous record set in the year while sales recovered strongly  earnings declined to less than of their pre recession levels 
this was anticipated by management and reflected in our quarterly guidance last year 
as we have previously stated  we are committed to exceeding our historic earnings levels 
clearly  recessions aren t good for the staffing industry  so we welcome this recovery 
historically  during the early stages of a recovery  companies are uncertain if the improvement in their business will continue 
rather than hiring full time employees  they tend to add temporary staff 
typically  during this early period of the recovery  our sales grow at an accelerated rate 
when companies become confident that the recovery is for real they will begin adding to their permanent workforce 
at that point  our sales continue to increase but at a more normal rate 
it is also at this time that we would expect to see temporary to permanent conversions fees and placement fees begin to accelerate 
another historic expectation when coming out of a recession is a significant increase in workers compensation costs and state unemployment taxes 
the increases we experienced in and the anticipated increases in state unemployment taxes for have been particularly large 
however  these increases should have only a short term effect on our earnings 
the staffing industry has always been difficult to forecast 
the duration and strength of economic recoveries will vary which  in turn  impacts our growth rates 
also  during the last decade  we have seen many fundamental changes in the business  which may also affect growth rates 
for example temporaries are a larger part of the workforce 
over the last decade  temporary employees in the us  as a percent of the workforce  grew from to 
since the recession began  that percentage has declined back to but we expect it to rebound quickly 
there has been more widespread acceptance and growth of the professional and technical staffing areas 
recruitment fees have become more important as more companies use temporary to permanent as a preferred hiring model 
in the case of kelly  our mix of businesses and geographic coverage are very different than they were ten years ago 
the pattern of recovery for our industry is yet to be determined and comparisons to the past may be of limited use 
however  in any event  we believe the future should be very positive for kelly services 
results of operations versus revenue from services for totaled billion  an increase of from the same period in the prior year 
this was the result of an increase in hours worked of and an increase in average hourly bill rates of 
revenue from services increased in each of the company s three business segments us commercial staffing  ptsa and international 
during the past year  the us dollar declined in comparison to many foreign currencies  including the euro and british pound 
as a result  kelly s us dollar translated revenue from services was higher than would have otherwise been reported 
on a constant currency basis  revenue from services increased as compared with the prior year 
management believes constant currency measurements are an important analytical tool to aid in understanding underlying operating trends without distortion due to currency fluctuations 
the table below summarizes the impact of foreign exchange adjustments on revenue from services for revenue from services change in millions of dollars us commercial staffing ptsa international constant currency revenue from services constant currency foreign currency impact revenue from services gross profit of million was higher than gross profit as a percentage of revenues was in  which decreased percentage point compared to the rate recorded in the prior year 
this reflected decreases in the gross profit rates of all three business segments 
the decrease in the gross profit rate was primarily due to higher workers compensation costs and  to the extent not recovered through pricing actions  higher payroll taxes 
during  primarily as a result of higher than expected medical inflation rates  the company revised its estimate of the cost of outstanding workers compensation claims and  accordingly  recorded additional expense of million 
workers compensation costs  excluding the impact of the revision of the estimate of outstanding claims  are expected to remain at the current level for payroll taxes  which included a favorable resolution related to federal payroll tax claims  are expected to increase as a result of continuing increases in state unemployment taxes 
kelly is attempting to recover these additional costs by re pricing customer contracts 
selling  general and administrative expenses of million were higher than last year 
selling  general and administrative expenses expressed as a percentage of revenues were in  a percentage point decrease compared to the rate in as measured on a constant currency basis  selling  general and administrative expenses increased compared to the prior year 
higher marketing expenses and costs associated with the implementation of kelly staffnet  the company s new branch automation system  have been offset by lower incentive based compensation and retirement program costs 
in addition  expenses included additional costs related to the company s information technology programs and a loss related to the company s equity investment in itiliti  an internet based vendor management software provider 
net interest expense for was thousand  compared to net interest income of thousand in the change is primarily attributable to lower cash balances and lower interest rates earned on the cash balances 
earnings before taxes were million  a decrease of from earnings before taxes averaged of revenues in and of revenues in the effective income tax rate for was  a small increase from last year s rate of 
the net increase is attributable to valuation allowances established for certain international tax loss carryforwards  partially offset by the favorable settlement of prior years tax audits 
the company expects its effective tax rate to average approximately in net earnings were million  or a decrease compared to basic and diluted earnings per share were  a decrease of as compared to basic and diluted earnings per share of in us commercial staffing revenue from services in the us commercial staffing segment totaled billion in  a increase compared to the billion reported for the same period in this reflected a increase in hours worked and a increase in average hourly bill rates 
year over year revenue comparisons were up in the first quarter  down in the second quarter  down in the third quarter and up in the fourth quarter 
year over year revenue growth strengthened month by month over the course of the fourth quarter 
us commercial staffing revenue from services represented of total company revenue from services for and for us commercial staffing earnings from operations totaled million for compared to earnings of million last year  a decrease of 
the decrease in earnings from operations was primarily attributable to a percentage point decrease in the gross profit rate partially offset by the increase in revenue 
the decrease in the gross profit rate was primarily the result of higher workers compensation costs 
as noted above  the company revised its estimate of the cost of outstanding workers compensation claims and  accordingly  recorded additional expense in of the total million additional workers compensation expense  million was charged to us commercial staffing 
higher state unemployment taxes  to the extent not recovered through pricing actions and  to a lesser extent  shifts in customer and service line mix to lower gross profit business also reduced the segment gross profit rate 
many of the company s large corporate and national account customers have negotiated high volume global service agreements  which tend to result in lower gross profit rates than those earned with the company s small and medium size customers 
the company s strategy is focused on serving and growing these large corporate national accounts 
as customer mix shifts to large corporate and national accounts  the company s average gross margins tend to decrease 
the company expects this trend to continue in the company has also experienced a shift in its mix of business from the office clerical to light industrial service lines 
because light industrial business typically generates lower gross profit rates than office clerical staffing  this mix shift has also tended to reduce the company s average gross profit rates 
the company believes this shift in business mix is  in large part  related to the current economic environment and expects this shift in business mix to reverse when the economy fully recovers 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by as compared to the prior year and  as a percentage of revenues  were for both and the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was due primarily to the impact of the company s ongoing deployment of new front office systems in part offset by lower field bonus costs and decreases in the cost of retirement programs 
professional  technical and staffing alternatives revenue from services in the ptsa segment for totaled million  an increase of compared to the million reported in this reflected a increase in average hourly bill rates  partially offset by a decrease in hours worked in the professional and technical businesses 
revenues in the staffing alternatives businesses  which include staff leasing  management services  hrfirst and vendor management services  increased by compared to ptsa revenues from services represented of total company revenues in both and effective with the first quarter of  the company changed its method of reporting revenue for kelly staff leasing ksl  a wholly owned subsidiary 
ksl is a professional employer organization peo and is part of the ptsa segment 
consistent with changing peo industry practice  ksl changed from the gross method of reporting revenue to the net method under emerging issues task force issue no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
as a result  ksl no longer included worksite employee payroll costs in revenue from services or cost of services 
this change did not impact gross profit or net earnings 
revenue from services and cost of services have been reclassified for all prior periods for comparability 
the effect of this change on prior periods was to reduce revenue from services and cost of services for and by million and million  respectively 
revenue from services and cost of services adjustments for the first  second  third and fourth quarters of were million  million  million  and million  respectively 
results varied among the business units that comprise ptsa 
during  kelly financial resources  kelly law registry  kelly hr first  kelly management services and kelly vendor management all exhibited double digit sales growth as compared to kelly healthcare  kelly staff leasing  kelly information technology resources and kelly automotive services group also maintained positive revenue growth 
however  three large ptsa units  kelly scientific resources  kelly home care and kelly engineering resources  experienced revenue declines during as compared to the prior year 
these decreases  however  were consistent with industry trends in their staffing sectors 
ptsa earnings from operations for totaled million and increased from the same period in this was the result of the increase in revenue from services partially offset by a percentage point decrease in the gross profit rate and a increase in expenses 
the decrease in the gross profit rate was primarily the result of higher workers compensation costs 
ptsa was also impacted by higher workers compensation expense  primarily due to kelly staff leasing 
ptsa s share of the total million additional charge for workers compensation was million 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenues were for and for international translated us dollar revenue from services in the international segment for totaled billion  a increase compared to the billion reported for this resulted from an increase in hours worked of and a increase in the translated us dollar average hourly bill rates 
international revenue from services represented of total company revenues in and in on a constant currency basis  revenue from services increased and average hourly bill rates decreased 
the year over year decrease in average hourly bill rates  on a constant currency basis  is due primarily to a shift in mix of hours worked to countries such as mexico  russia and malaysia  which typically have a lower average bill rate 
the strong improvements realized in revenue were caused by both a general economic recovery in most countries  and kelly s particular focus on sales growth 
fourth quarter sales growth was positive in all regions uk ireland  the americas  asia pacific and continental europe 
in our uk ireland operations  sales accelerated significantly during the second half of the year and revenues for the fourth quarter increased year over year 
the uk economy is now beginning to experience signs of a turnaround 
the increase in revenue is primarily due to new staffing accounts added throughout the year 
in addition  our fee based recruiting businesses showed encouraging signs of improvement during the fourth quarter with year over year growth of 
during the fourth quarter  consistent with the third quarter  revenue grew by in the americas as compared with however  unlike the third quarter where growth was primarily fueled by mexico  the fourth quarter saw stronger revenue growth in canada and puerto rico as well 
the asia pacific growth was generated by our operations in australia  new zealand  singapore  and malaysia 
after experiencing strong revenue growth in the third quarter  revenue grew by year over year in the fourth quarter 
we also saw encouraging year over year revenue growth in continental europe during the second half of the year 
revenue in continental europe turned positive in the third quarter and increased nearly in the fourth quarter 
the majority of the countries in which we operate  such as spain  russia  norway  luxembourg and holland  experienced solid revenue increases  while germany continued to post revenue declines 
although our temporary staffing business is recovering in continental europe  our fee based income continues to lag  as our recruiting business has been hit the hardest in this region 
as economic conditions continue to improve  we expect fee based income to begin to recover 
international reported a loss of million for  compared to earnings of million for the increase in revenue from services was more than offset by a percentage point decrease in the gross profit rate and a increase in expenses  as measured in us dollars 
international results continued to improve as the year progressed 
the segment recorded a loss of million in the first quarter  a loss of million in the second quarter and income of million in each of the third and fourth quarters 
the decrease in the international gross profit rate is due to rate decreases in the united kingdom and france  as well as the effect of lower fee based income on a constant currency basis 
the increase in us dollar reported expenses is due primarily to the effect of currency rates 
on a constant currency basis  expenses increased by 
results of operations versus revenue from services for totaled billion  an increase of compared to the billion reported in the increase was primarily the result of an increase in average hourly bill rates of 
hours worked were essentially unchanged year over year 
revenue increases in the us commercial staffing and professional  technical and staffing alternatives ptsa segments were partially offset by a slight revenue decrease in the international segment 
on a constant currency basis  revenues for increased as compared to the table below summarizes the impact of foreign exchange adjustments on revenue from services revenue from services change in millions of dollars us commercial staffing ptsa international constant currency revenue from services constant currency foreign currency impact revenue from services gross profit of million was lower than the gross profit of million in gross profit as a percentage of revenues was in  a decrease of percentage point compared to the rate recorded in gross profit rates of the ptsa and international segments declined while us commercial staffing remained relatively unchanged 
the decline in gross profit rates was due primarily to a continuing shift in the mix of customers to large corporate and national accounts and a decline in recruitment fee income 
selling  general and administrative expenses of million were lower than the expense rate improved to of revenues in as compared to in the decrease was due primarily to staff reductions and lower telecommunication and recruiting costs  which were the result of expense reduction initiatives the company implemented during  and the elimination of goodwill amortization see discussion to follow in critical accounting estimates 
the staff reductions in both field operations and headquarters units generated savings of approximately million in as compared with the company did not incur significant termination costs as a result of these staff reductions 
the majority of the staff reductions took place during the second and third quarters of these savings were partially offset by field and headquarters bonus payments  which increased due to the company s improved performance  the effect of currency rates on international expenses and increased depreciation expense as a result of the company s ongoing deployment of information technology programs 
earnings from operations in totaled million  an increase compared to the million reported for the increase in earnings from operations was the result of many factors discussed above  including the elimination of goodwill amortization of million 
earnings were of sales for both and net interest income for was thousand  a thousand improvement compared to net interest expense of thousand in the improvement is primarily attributable to higher cash balances and lower short term debt levels  offset by the impact of lower interest rates 
earnings before taxes were million  an increase of from earnings before taxes averaged of revenues in and of revenues in the effective income tax rate in was  a percentage point improvement compared with the rate in the decrease in the overall income tax rate was the result of several factors including the favorable settlement of prior years tax audits  offset by an increase in valuation reserves related to the company s ability to utilize foreign net operating loss carryforwards 
net earnings were million in  a increase compared to the million earned in basic and diluted earnings per share were  an increase of as compared to basic and diluted earnings per share of in us commercial staffing revenue from services in the us commercial staffing segment  which represented of total company revenues in and  totaled billion in  a increase compared to the billion reported for the increase was primarily the result of an increase in average hourly bill rates of  offset by a decrease in hours worked 
year over year revenue comparisons were down in the first quarter  flat in the second quarter  up in the third quarter and up in the fourth quarter 
revenue trends were relatively stable month by month over the course of the fourth quarter in us commercial staffing earnings totaled million  an increase of in  as a result of the revenue increase  relatively stable gross profit rates and a decrease in expenses 
the gross profit rate averaged in both and improvements in benefit costs were offset by the impact of an ongoing shift in mix of revenues to larger corporate and national accounts 
year over year gross profit rate comparisons for us commercial staffing were down in the first and second quarters and up in the third and fourth quarters 
the increase in gross profit rate in the second half of reflected improvement in benefits costs relative to last year and increased fee based income in the fourth quarter 
us commercial staffing expenses were tightly controlled and decreased year over year primarily due to staff reductions and lower recruiting costs  partially offset by higher field bonus payouts and the impact of the company s ongoing deployment of new front office systems 
professional  technical and staffing alternatives revenue from services in the ptsa segment totaled million  an increase of compared to the million reported in the growth is due to an increase in average hourly bill rates of  partially offset by a decrease in hours worked of in the professional and technical businesses 
in addition  there was an increase in revenues of in the staffing alternatives businesses 
ptsa revenue from services represented of total company revenues in and during  kelly healthcare resources and kelly financial resources continued to be the leading performers  exhibiting revenue growth of over as compared to kelly staff leasing  kelly engineering resources  kelly it resources  kelly management services and kelly law registry also maintained positive revenue growth in kelly automotive services group posted positive growth in the second half of the year  resulting in a slight overall increase year over year 
however  kelly home care services experienced a significant revenue decline during as compared to this decrease  however  was consistent with industry trends in its staffing sector 
ptsa earnings from operations totaled million in  an increase of from this was the result of the increase in revenue from services  partially offset by a percentage point decrease in the gross profit rate and the effect of holding expenses to a increase 
the decrease in the gross profit rate was due to changes in business unit mix and rate decreases in certain business units  such as kelly automotive services group and kelly it resources 
the most significant factor impacting the business unit mix was the decline in revenues at the kelly home care services unit  which has a higher than average gross profit rate 
these declines were partially offset by a year over year increase in ptsa fee based income 
ptsa expenses increased from  due to higher field bonus payouts  the impact of the company s ongoing deployment of new front office systems  higher liability insurance costs and increased facilities expense associated with the expansion of kelly financial resources and kelly healthcare resources 
this was partially offset by the elimination of goodwill amortization and lower recruiting costs 
expenses as a percent of revenues decreased to in from in international translated us dollar revenue from services in international totaled billion  a decrease compared to the billion reported in this decrease resulted primarily from a decrease in recruitment fees and a decrease in hours worked 
us dollar average bill rates were essentially unchanged year over year 
international revenue from services represented of total company revenues in and the americas and asia pacific  the first regions within the international segment to reflect the negative impact of the global economic slowdown  continued to show improvement 
year over year revenue comparisons in continental europe and the united kingdom remained negative throughout during  the us dollar continued to fall in comparison to many foreign currencies  including the euro and british pound 
as a result  kelly s us dollar translated revenues and expenses were higher than would have otherwise been reported 
on a constant currency basis  international revenue decreased 
this compared to overall constant currency revenue growth in year over year constant currency revenue from services declined in the first quarter  in the second quarter  in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter 
international earnings totaled million  a decrease of from  resulting from the decrease in revenue from services and a percentage point decline in the gross profit rate  partially offset by a reduction in expenses 
the decline in the gross profit rate was primarily due to the decrease in recruitment fee income  with the most significant decrease occurring in the united kingdom 
on a year over year basis  translated us dollar expenses in the international segment decreased  primarily due to lower wages and recruiting costs and the elimination of goodwill amortization 
on a constant currency basis  expenses decreased 
financial condition historically  kelly has financed its operations through cash generated by operating activities and available from revolving credit facilities 
as highlighted in the statements of cash flows  the company s liquidity and available capital resources are impacted by four key components cash and equivalents  operating activities  investing activities and financing activities 
cash and equivalents cash and equivalents totaled million at the end of  a decrease of million from the million at year end and a decrease of million from the million at year end as further described below  during the company generated million of cash from operating activities and used million of cash in investing activities and million in financing activities 
operating activities in  the company generated million in cash in its operating activities  as compared to million in and million in the most significant reason for the decrease in cash generated from operations was that accounts receivable grew at a faster rate in versus and accounts receivable totaled million at the end of global days sales outstanding at the end of were days  which is an increase of days as compared with the prior year 
if the economy continues to recover in  the company expects to experience further growth in revenue  which may require the company to fund additional increases in accounts receivable 
the company s working capital position was million at the end of  an increase of million from year end and an increase of million from the current ratio was at the end of  as compared with at year end and at year end investing activities in  the company used million for investing activities compared to million in and million in capital expenditures for totaled million  down from the million spent in and down almost from the million spent in capital expenditures for are primarily related to the company s information technology programs 
capital spending in is expected to total between and million 
during the first quarter of  the company acquired a fully leased commercial office building that will be used for future expansion 
this transaction was the second leg of a tax free exchange for undeveloped land the company initiated in the fourth quarter of the land was effectively swapped for the building  but in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  it was shown as a cash acquisition for million during the related million cash proceeds from the sale of property was reflected in the cash from investing activities 
financing activities in  the company used million in financing activities  as compared to million in and million in in  the company used million to repurchase stock as compared to million in however  this was offset by additional short term borrowings of million in  as compared to repayments of million in and million in in september  the company repurchased  shares of class a common stock in a negotiated transaction from the william r 
kelly trust 
the total value of the share repurchase was million or per share  representing a discount to the closing market price of kelly class a common stock on the business day prior to the purchase 
in july  the company repurchased  shares of class a common stock from the william r 
kelly trust 
the total value of the share repurchase was million or per share  representing a discount to the closing market price of kelly class a common stock on the business day prior to the purchase 
these repurchase transactions were reflected in the company s third quarter financial statements for and short term debt totaled million at year end  compared to million at year end and million at year end at the end of  debt represented approximately of total capital 
as of year end  the company had million of committed unused credit facilities 
in june   the company entered into a new million three year  unsecured multi currency revolving credit facility to replace its existing million revolving credit facility which was scheduled to expire in october  the credit facility will be used to fund working capital  acquisitions and for general corporate purposes 
the interest rate applicable to borrowings under the new facility is basis points over local libor 
at year end  the company had additional uncommitted one year credit facilities totaling million  under which the company had borrowed million dollars 
the company intends to continue its expansion program  adding one or two new countries or service lines each year by organic growth and small strategic acquisitions 
targeted countries areas include  japan  eastern europe and south america 
dividends paid per common share were 
in and  a decrease of from dividends of 
per share 
the dividend was reduced in the fourth quarter of to a new rate of 
per share per quarter  or 
per share annually 
annual cash savings from this reduction are over million per year 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments summarized below are the company s obligations and commitments to make future payments under lease agreements and debt obligations as of year end total less than year years years more than years operating leases short term borrowings total the company has no material  unrecorded commitments  losses  contingencies or guarantees associated with any related parties or unconsolidated entities 
summary the company s financial position remains strong 
the company continues to carry no long term debt and expects to meet its cash requirements  including possible increases in accounts receivable as discussed above  principally through cash generated from operations  available cash and equivalents and committed unused credit facilities 
market risk sensitive instruments and positions kelly does not hold or invest in derivative contracts 
the company is exposed to foreign currency risk primarily due to its net investment in foreign subsidiaries  which conduct business in their local currencies 
these risks are mitigated by the use of the company s multi currency line of credit 
this credit facility is used to borrow in local currencies  which mitigates the exchange rate risk resulting from foreign currency denominated net investments fluctuating in relation to the us dollar 
in addition  the company is exposed to interest rate risks through its use of the multi currency line of credit 
the company is exposed to market risk as a result of its obligation to pay benefits under its nonqualified deferred compensation plan and its related investments in company owned variable universal life insurance policies 
the obligation to employees increases and decreases based on movements in the equity and debt markets 
the investments in publicly traded mutual funds  as part of the company owned variable universal life insurance policies  are designed to mitigate this risk with offsetting gains and losses 
overall  the company s holdings and positions in market risk sensitive instruments do not subject the company to material risk 
critical accounting estimates the company prepares its financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
in this process  it is necessary for management to make certain assumptions and related estimates affecting the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the attached notes 
actual results can differ from assumed and estimated amounts 
critical accounting estimates are those that management believes require the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those estimates may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
the company considers the following estimates to be most critical in understanding the judgments involved in preparing its consolidated financial statements 
allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable we make ongoing estimates relating to the collectibility of our accounts receivable and maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
in determining the amount of the allowance  we consider our historical level of credit losses and apply percentages to certain aged receivable categories 
we also make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations  and we monitor current economic trends that might impact the level of credit losses in the future 
historically  losses from uncollectible accounts have not exceeded our allowance 
since we cannot predict with certainty future changes in the financial stability of our customers  actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments  a larger allowance may be required 
in the event we determined that a smaller or larger allowance was appropriate  we would record a credit or a charge to selling  general and administrative expense in the period in which we made such a determination 
as of year end  and  the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable was million  million and million  respectively 
workers compensation the company has a combination of insurance and self insurance contracts under which the company effectively bears the first  of risk per single accident 
the company establishes accruals for workers compensation utilizing actuarial methods to estimate the undiscounted future cash payments that will be made to satisfy the claims  including an allowance for incurred but not reported claims 
this process includes establishing loss development factors  based on the historical claims experience of the company and the industry  and applying those factors to current claims information to derive an estimate of the company s ultimate claims liability 
in preparing the estimates  we also consider the nature and severity of the claims  analyses provided by third party claims administrators  as well as current legal  economic and regulatory factors 
management evaluates the accrual  and the underlying assumptions  regularly throughout the year and makes adjustments as needed 
the ultimate cost of these claims may be greater than or less than the established accrual 
while management believes that the recorded amounts are adequate  there can be no assurances that changes to management s estimates will not occur due to limitations inherent in the estimation process 
in the event we determine that a smaller or larger accrual is appropriate  we would record a credit or a charge to cost of services in the period in which we made such a determination 
the accrual for workers compensation was million  million and million at year end  and  respectively 
goodwill effective december   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  which established a new method of testing goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment using a fair value based approach 
under the new standard  goodwill is no longer amortized as was previously required 
upon adoption  amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets ceased 
amortization of goodwill would have been million for the fiscal year ended december  sfas requires that goodwill be tested for impairment annually or if an event occurs or circumstances change that may reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its book value 
should circumstances change or events occur to indicate that the fair market value of the reporting unit has fallen below its book value  management must then compare the estimated fair value of goodwill to book value 
if the book value exceeds the estimated fair value  an impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
such an impairment loss would be recognized as a non cash charge to operating income 
we completed our impairment test as of the date of adoption  december  and during the fourth quarter of the years ended december  and december   as required under sfas and determined that goodwill is not impaired 
this test required comparison of our estimated fair value to our book value of goodwill 
the estimated fair value was based on a discounted cash flows analysis 
assumptions and estimates about future cash flows and discount rates are complex and often subjective 
they can be affected by a variety of factors  including external factors such as industry and economic trends  and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts 
although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate  different assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported financial results 
different assumptions of the anticipated future benefits from these businesses could result in an impairment charge  which would decrease operating income and result in lower asset values on our balance sheet 
at year end  and  total goodwill amounted to million  million and million  respectively 
income taxes income tax expense is based on expected income and statutory tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
judgment is required in determining our income tax expense 
we establish accruals when  despite our belief that reported taxable income is fully supportable  we believe that challenges are likely and that we may not succeed 
we adjust these accruals in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the progress of a tax audit 
our effective tax rate includes the impact of accrual provisions and changes to accruals that we consider appropriate  as well as related interest 
this rate is then applied to our quarterly operating results 
in the event that there is a significant unusual or one time item recognized in our operating results  the tax attributable to that item would be separately calculated and recorded at the same time as the unusual or one time item 
tax laws require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements 
as a result  the income tax expense reflected in our financial statements is different than the liability reported in our tax return 
some of these differences are permanent  such as expenses which are not deductible on our tax return  and some are temporary differences  such as depreciation expense 
temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in our tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our income statement 
we establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets when the amount of expected future taxable income is not likely to support the use of the deduction or credit 
deferred tax liabilities generally represent items for which we have already taken a deduction on our tax return  but have not yet recognized as expense in our financial statements 
a number of years may elapse before a particular matter  for which we have established an accrual  is audited and finally resolved 
while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter  we believe that our accruals reflect the probable outcome of tax contingencies 
favorable or unfavorable settlement of any particular issue would be recognized as an increase or decrease to our income tax expense in the year of resolution 
our tax accruals are presented in the balance sheet within income and other taxes
