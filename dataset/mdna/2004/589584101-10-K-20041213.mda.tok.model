future trends life science during fiscal  meridian opened its protein production laboratory for commercial operation  creating the opportunity to utilize its capabilities to enable the development of new drugs and vaccines 
this protein production laboratory is an extension of meridian s existing antigen manufacturing technologies and capabilities 
during fiscal  meridian completed the manufacturing and delivery of recombinant proteins for the national institutes of health to be used in a vaccine for parvovirus fifth disease in phase i clinical trials 
revenue for this phase of the contract   was recognized during the fourth quarter 
during fiscal  meridian expects to deliver additional protein material for phase ii clinical trials and perform contract manufacturing for other customers 
during november  meridian executed a letter of intent to purchase all the outstanding capital stock of oem concepts  a manufacturer and distributor of bulk antibodies to the diagnostic  pharmaceutical and research markets 
this pending acquisition  which is subject to due diligence review and execution of a definitive agreement  will add large volume monoclonal antibody manufacturing capabilities to meridian s life science operating segment and will complement the viral antigens and biodesign subsidiaries 
it will also decrease meridian s reliance on third parties for monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies 
sales and marketing resources at meridian s viral antigens and biodesign subsidiaries have been aligned to focus on common customers and complementary products 
oem concepts will be similarly aligned shortly after acquisition 
as part of our overall life science strategy  meridian also expects to develop or license unique biological tools and technology 
the pending acquisition  oem concepts  has rights to via licenses or owns approximately cell lines 
european diagnostics meridian s european diagnostics operating segment experienced sales growth in fiscal and fiscal of and  respectively  following two successive years of sales declines of in fiscal and in fiscal although currency translation accounts for most of the fiscal and increases  sales in 
table of contents local currency  the euro  increased during both fiscal and during the last several years  competitive factors and government reimbursement policies slowed growth in european markets and sales in fiscal and fiscal were also negatively affected by currency translation 
based on operating results for fiscal and fiscal  meridian believes that sales levels in local currency have stabilized  and in fact  believes that market conditions have begun to improve and will yield modest growth 
sales in local currency  the euro  increased during the last six months of fiscal compared to fiscal us diagnostics consolidation of the us healthcare industry is expected to continue and potentially affect meridian s customers 
industry consolidation puts pressure on pricing and aggregates buying power 
in response  in the last several years  meridian has entered into  extended  or renewed several exclusive multiple year contracts with consolidated healthcare providers and supply agreements with major reference laboratories 
research and development meridian believes that internally developed products will continue to be a critical source of sales and sales growth 
research and development efforts are expected to focus on the development of new products and product improvements where meridian has a dominant market position  or its intellectual property is protected by patents or licenses 
during the second quarter of fiscal  meridian launched its immunocard stat hpsa rapid diagnostic test for h 
pylori in domestic markets us diagnostics segment  following fda k clearance in december this rapid detection test is intended to complement meridian s previously developed premier platinum hpsa diagnostic test 
during the first quarter of fiscal  meridian launched its immunocard c 
difficile toxins a b rapid diagnostic test in domestic markets us diagnostics segment 
it was launched in european markets in fiscal this rapid diagnostic test will add breadth to meridian s c 
difficile product offerings 
during the first quarter of fiscal  meridian also expects to launch  in domestic and european markets  new diagnostic tests for certain respiratory diseases 
meridian expects its life science operating segment will serve as a key platform for sourcing biologicals and technologies  by acquisition or license  for development of new products for all of meridian s operating segments 
one of meridian s specific strategies in this area is to target biologicals that have commercial product applications across multiple markets  such as human diagnostics  veterinary diagnostics  and 
table of contents therapeutics 
this strategy is expected to leverage research and development resources as products can be developed with all three markets in mind  rather than on a market by market basis 
operating segments as a result of changes that occurred in february in the organization and management of meridian s businesses  effective with the quarter beginning january  meridian s second quarter  meridian changed its reportable operating segments to us diagnostics  european diagnostics  and life science 
the us diagnostics operating segment consists of manufacturing operations in cincinnati  ohio  and the sale and distribution of diagnostic test kits in the us and countries outside of europe  africa and the middle east

critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
such accounting principles require management to make judgments about estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures 
management believes that the following accounting policies are critical to understanding the accompanying consolidated financial statements because the application of such polices requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions and the carrying values of related assets and liabilities are material 
revenue recognition meridian s revenues are derived primarily from product sales 
revenue is generally recognized when product is shipped and title has passed to the buyer 
revenue for the us diagnostics operating segment is reduced at the date of sale for estimated rebates and cash discounts that will be claimed by customers 
rebate agreements are in place with certain independent national distributors and are designed to reimburse such distributors for their cost in handling meridian s products 
management estimates reserves for rebate agreements and cash 
table of contents discounts based on historical statistics  current trends  and other factors 
changes to these reserves are recorded in the period that they become known 
revenue for the life science operating segment s make to order bulk antigen and antibody products is recognized upon shipment and acceptance by the customer 
revenue for the life science operating segment s protein production laboratory may be recognized either upon shipment of product or final lot acceptance depending on contract terms 
inventories meridian s inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined on a first in  first out basis  except for inventories in the viral antigens business for which cost is determined on a last in  first out basis 
meridian establishes reserves against cost for excess and obsolete materials  finished goods whose shelf life may expire before sale to customers  and other identified exposures 
management estimates reserves based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than such estimates  additional inventory writedowns would be required and this would negatively affect gross profit margin and overall results of operations 
changes to inventory reserves are recorded in the period that they become known 
for the viral antigens purchase business combination  meridian elected to use last in  first out accounting for inventories for financial reporting purposes 
under last in  first out accounting  the stepped up inventory value will be charged to earnings in periods in which inventory quantities decline below those on hand at the acquisition date 
to date  inventory quantities have remained above levels on hand at the acquisition date 
intangible assets meridian s intangible assets include identifiable intangibles and goodwill 
identifiable intangibles include customer lists  supply agreements  manufacturing technologies  patents  licenses  trade names  and non compete agreements 
all of meridian s identifiable intangibles have finite lives 
during the first quarter of fiscal  meridian adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
provides that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized over their useful lives  but rather  are now subject to an annual impairment review or more frequently if impairment indicators arise by applying a fair value based test 
there have been no impairments from the analyses required by sfas no 
identifiable intangibles with finite lives are subject to impairment testing as prescribed by sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
 identifiable intangibles with finite lives are reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that such assets may not be recoverable at their current carrying value 
whether an event or circumstance 
table of contents triggers an impairment is determined by comparing an estimate of the asset s undiscounted future cash flows to its carrying value 
if impairment has occurred  it is measured by a fair value based test 
meridian adopted sfas no 
effective october  there were no impairments from adoption and no events or circumstances since adoption indicating that the assets may not be recoverable 
meridian s ability to recover its intangible assets  both identifiable intangibles and goodwill  is dependent upon the future cash flows of the related acquired businesses and assets 
the application of sfas nos 
and requires management to make judgments and assumptions regarding future cash flows  including sales levels  gross profit margins  operating expense levels  working capital levels  and capital expenditures 
with respect to identifiable intangibles  management also makes judgments and assumptions regarding useful lives 
management considers the following factors in evaluating events and circumstances for possible impairment i significant under performance relative to historical or projected operating results  ii negative industry trends  iii sales levels of specific groups of products related to specific identifiable intangibles  iv changes in overall business strategies and v other factors 
if actual cash flows are less favorable than projections  this could trigger impairment of intangible assets 
if impairment were to occur  this would negatively affect overall results of operations 
income taxes pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  meridian s provision for income taxes includes federal  foreign  state  and local income taxes currently payable and those deferred because of temporary differences between income for financial reporting and income for tax purposes 
meridian prepares estimates of permanent and temporary differences between income for financial reporting purposes and income for tax purposes 
these differences are adjusted to actual upon filing of meridian s tax returns  typically occurring in the third and fourth quarters of the current fiscal year for the preceding fiscal year s estimates 
meridian s deferred tax assets include net operating loss carryforwards in foreign jurisdictions 
the realization of tax benefits related to net operating loss carryforwards is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income in the applicable jurisdictions 
management assesses the level of deferred tax asset valuation allowance by taking into consideration historical and future projected operating results  future reversals of taxable temporary differences  as well as tax planning strategies 
the amount of net deferred tax asset considered realizable could be reduced in future years if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced 
undistributed earnings in meridian s foreign subsidiaries are considered by management to be permanently re invested in such subsidiaries 
consequently  us deferred tax liabilities on such earnings have not been 
table of contents recorded 
management believes that such us taxes would be largely offset by foreign tax credits for taxes paid in applicable foreign jurisdictions 
from time to time  meridian s tax returns in federal  state  and foreign jurisdictions are examined by the applicable tax authorities 
meridian s tax provisions take into consideration the judgmental nature of certain tax positions 
meridian believes that it has complied with all tax laws and regulations to which it is subject  and that the results of any tax authority examinations will not have a significant adverse impact on its financial condition 
to the extent that tax benefits result from the completion of these examinations or the passing of statutes of limitation  they will affect the provision in the period known
