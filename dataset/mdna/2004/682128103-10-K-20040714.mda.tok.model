overview we design  develop and market high performance  highly integrated and cost efficient semiconductor image sensor devices 
our main product  an image sensing device called the camerachip  is used to capture an image and is used in a number of consumer and commercial mass market applications 
our camerachips are designed to use the complementary metal oxide semiconductor  or cmos  fabrication process 
we have designed our camerachip as a single chip solution that integrates several distinct functions including image capture  image processing  color processing  signal conversion and output of a fully processed image or video stream 
we believe that our highly integrated camerachips enable camera device manufacturers to build high quality camera products that are smaller  less complex  more reliable  lower cost and more power efficient than cameras using either traditional charge coupled devices  or ccds  or multiple chip cmos image sensors 
our camerachips are currently used in a number of consumer applications including digital still and video cameras  cell phones  personal computers and toys and games such as interactive video games 
our camerachips are sold to customers who incorporate them in either digital or analog mass market applications 
some examples of digital mass market applications that currently incorporate our camerachips are digital still cameras  cell phone cameras and personal computer camera applications 
some examples of analog applications that currently incorporate our camerachips are security and surveillance cameras and toy cameras 
we sell our products worldwide directly to oems  which include branded customers and contract manufacturers  and vars and indirectly through distributors 
we currently outsource the wafer fabrication  color filter application and packaging of our camerachip products 
this approach allows us to focus our resources on the design  development and marketing of our products and significantly reduces our capital requirements 
we have relocated a substantial portion of our automated image testing equipment from the united states to china 
we completed the majority of this transition by the end of fiscal and anticipate that we will complete the remainder of this transition prior to mid fiscal in addition  we also expect to expand testing capabilities with additional automated testing equipment  which will also be located in china 
in october  we entered into a shareholders agreement with taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company  or tsmc  pursuant to which we agreed with tsmc to form visera technology company  or visera  a joint venture in taiwan  for the purposes of providing manufacturing services and automated final testing services 
in connection with the formation of visera  we and tsmc have separately agreed to enter into nonexclusive license agreements with visera pursuant to which both parties will license certain intellectual property to visera relating to manufacturing services and automated final testing services 
once visera has the capability to deliver high quality manufacturing services and automated final testing services  we have committed to direct a substantial portion of our requirements in these areas to visera  subject to pricing and technology requirements 
we and tsmc have also committed not to compete directly or indirectly in the future with visera in the fields of certain manufacturing services and automated final testing services 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations historically  we have relied upon tsmc to provide us with a substantial proportion of our wafers 
however  we had never entered into a long term supply agreement with tsmc and instead had traditionally secured manufacturing availability on a purchase order basis 
as a part of the shareholders agreement  tsmc has agreed to commit substantial wafer manufacturing capacity to us in exchange for our commitment to purchase a substantial portion of our wafers from tsmc  subject to pricing and technology requirements 
as of april   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents and approximately million in short term investments 
to mitigate market risk related to short term investments  we have an investment policy designed to preserve the value of capital and to generate interest income from these investments without material exposure to market fluctuations 
market risk is the potential loss due to the change in value of a financial instrument as a result of changes in interest rates or bond prices 
our policy is to invest in financial instruments with short durations  limiting interest rate exposure  and to measure performance against comparable benchmarks 
we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including both government and corporate obligations with ratings of a or better and money market funds 
on january   we announced that our board of directors had approved a for split of our common stock to be effected in the form of a stock dividend payable to stockholders of record on january  stockholders of record received one additional share of common stock for every share held on january  the stock split was effected after the close of market on february   and the additional shares were distributed on february  all share and per share data in this annual report on form k are presented on a post split basis 
the current economic environment we have operated in a challenging economic environment that has undergone significant changes in technology and global trade 
we have striven to remain a leader in the development and marketing of image sensing devices based on the cmos fabrication process and have benefited from the growing market demand for and acceptance of this emerging technology 
the shift in global fabrication to asia has introduced a range of cost pressures on domestic manufacturers 
in response to these pressures  and in order to be closer to our primary customer base and our source of offshore fabrication  we relocated a substantial portion of our testing operations to china during the first three quarters of this fiscal year 
we shipped more than million image sensors in fiscal year  which demonstrated the capabilities of our production system  including our source of offshore fabrication 
to enhance our production capabilities  we have initiated partnerships with a number of vendors  including tsmc  one of the largest wafer fabrication companies in asia 
the digital still camera market demonstrates a continuing trend toward higher resolution products with a growing acceptance of cmos based image sensors 
we have continued to benefit from a shift in product mix toward higher resolution products 
we believe that this shift in product mix will continue through we believe camera phones are still in the very early stages of adoption and that the opportunity presented by this market is still large 
we believe that  like the digital still camera market  camera phone demand will continue to shift toward higher resolutions 
as a result  we released our quarter inch megapixel camerachip designed specifically for camera phones and are currently in mass production with this product 
currently  we believe that video graphics array vga resolution will account for a large majority of the volume shipments in handsets during calendar  with an increasing transition to higher resolutions towards the end of calendar and beyond 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations as the markets for image sensors have grown  we have experienced increased competition from manufacturers of cmos and ccd image sensors 
in particular  we have experienced increased competition from companies such as canon  micron and sony in the market for cmos image sensors for digital still cameras 
in addition  we expect to see continued price competition in the markets for image sensors for digital cameras and mobile phones as those markets continue to grow 
although we believe that we currently compete effectively in those markets  our competitive position could be impaired by companies that have greater financial  technical  marketing  manufacturing  distribution and other resources  broader product lines  better access to large customer bases  greater name recognition  longer operating histories and more established strategic and financial relationships than we do 
such companies may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and customer requirements or devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products 
as a result of the increase in competition and the growth of various consumer product applications for image sensors  we have experienced a shortening in the life cycle of some camerachip products 
for example  although in the security and surveillance market we continue to sell camerachips introduced more than four years ago  in the digital camera market the product life cycle of image sensors appears to be three years or less 
one issue related to the shortening of product life cycles is that it will be increasingly difficult to accurately forecast customer demand for our products 
as a result  we face the risk of being unable to fulfill customer orders if we underestimate market demand and the risks of excess inventory and product obsolescence if we overestimate market demand for our products 
the shortening of product life cycles also increases the importance of having short product development cycles and being accurate in the prediction of market trends in the design of new products 
many of the products using our camerachips  such as digital still and video cameras  mobile phones and cameras for toys and games  are consumer electronics goods that have particular seasonal cycles 
historically  demand from oems and distributors that serve such consumer product markets has been stronger in the second and third quarters of our fiscal year and weaker in the first and fourth quarters of our fiscal year 
as these consumer product applications for image sensors grow  we expect to witness increased seasonality in our business  which could cause our results of operations to fluctuate from period to period 
we plan to introduce several new products in fiscal during the early stages of production  the production yields and gross margins for new products are typically lower than those of established products 
in addition  in preparation for new product introductions  we are gradually ramping down production of established products 
with our day production cycle  it will be extremely difficult to predict precisely how many units of established products we will need 
it will also be difficult to accurately predict the speed of the ramp of new products 
because of these circumstances  it is possible that we could suffer from shortages for certain products and also build inventories in excess of demand for other products 
sources of revenues we generate our revenue by selling our products directly to oems and vars and indirectly to distributors 
in addition  we derive a minimal portion of our revenue by providing engineering assistance to a limited number of our customers 
we treat sales to oems and vars as one source of revenue  in contrast to sales to distributors 
this is consistent with the differences in the company s revenue recognition policies between the two groups 
see critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition below for additional information regarding recognition of revenue 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
by their nature  these estimates and judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
on an ongoing basis we re evaluate our judgments and estimates including those related to product returns  bad debts  inventories  long lived assets  income taxes  litigation and contingencies 
we base our estimates and judgments on our historical experience  knowledge of current conditions and our beliefs of what could occur in the future considering available information 
actual results could differ from those estimates  and material effects on our operating results and financial position may result 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report on form k 
our estimates are guided by observing the following critical accounting policies revenue recognition we generate our revenue by selling our products to oems  vars and distributors 
for shipments to oems  vars and distributors without agreements that allow for returns or credits  we recognize revenue using the sell in method 
under this method  we recognize revenue upon the shipment of products to the customer provided that we have received a signed purchase order  the price is fixed or determinable  title and risk of loss has transferred to the customer  collection of resulting receivables is considered reasonably assured  product returns are reasonably estimable  there are no customer acceptance requirements and there are no remaining significant obligations 
we provide for future returns based on historical experience at the time revenue is recognized 
see allowance for doubtful accounts and sales return reserve below for additional information regarding sales return reserves 
for shipments to distributors under agreements allowing for returns or credits  revenue is recognized using the sell through method under which revenue is deferred until the distributor actually resells the product to the end user customer and we are notified in writing by the distributor of such sale 
deferred margin on shipment to distributors represents the amount billed less the cost of inventory shipped to but not yet sold by distributors 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in addition  we recognize revenue from the provision of engineering assistance to a limited number of our customers from time to time 
we recognize the associated revenue only upon the completion of  and acceptance by  the customer of the services performed 
the revenue is based on a fixed fee  which is agreed upon prior to initiation of the engineering assistance 
historically  revenue generated from such arrangements has been immaterial 
in order to determine whether collection is probable  we assess a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
if we determine that collection is not reasonably assured  we defer the recognition of revenue at the time until collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of payment 
allowance for doubtful accounts and sales return reserve credit evaluations are undertaken for all major sale transactions before shipment is authorized 
normal payment terms apply upon transfer of risk of loss 
on an ongoing basis  we analyze the payment history of customer accounts  including recent customer purchases 
we evaluate aged items in accounts receivable and provide reserves for doubtful accounts 
we also provide for estimated sales returns in the same period the related revenues are recorded 
the estimates are based on historical sales returns and other know factors 
customer creditworthiness and economic conditions may change and increase the risk of collectibility and sales returns and may require additional provisions  which would negatively impact our operating results 
as of april   our allowance for doubtful accounts represented approximately of total accounts receivable and our sales return reserve represented approximately of total accounts receivable 
inventory write off and effect on gross margin we regularly monitor inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventories based primarily on historical usage rates and our estimated forecast of product demand for a period of time  generally six months 
because of obsolescence  we will generally record a provision for the costs of our inventories in excess of our relevant forecast for the applicable period 
due to a significant supply imbalance in the pc camera market in the third quarter of fiscal  we experienced the cancellation of a significant portion of our backlog 
our revenues dropped from million for the second quarter of fiscal to million for the third quarter of fiscal as a result  we revised our estimates of product demand and recorded a charge of million for excess inventories in the third quarter of fiscal in fiscal  and  we sold certain of the inventories previously written off 
even though we sold the inventories at a price that was less than our original cost  because the inventory was previously written off  sales of the inventory improved our gross margins 
we attempt to control our inventory levels so that we do not hold inventories in excess of demand for the succeeding six months 
however  because we need to place non cancelable orders with significant lead time and because it is difficult to estimate product demand  it is possible that we will build inventories in excess of demand for the future periods 
if we have inventories in excess of estimated product demand  we will provide a reserve  which could have a material adverse effect on our reported results of operations and financial position 
in preparation for new product introductions  we are gradually ramping down production of established products  while preparing for production of newer products 
with our day production cycle  it will be extremely difficult to predict precisely how many units of established products we will need 
it will also be difficult to accurately predict the speed of the ramp of new products or the projected life cycles of new products which have continued to shorten in duration 
because of these circumstances  it is possible that we could suffer from shortages for certain products and also build inventories in excess of demand for other products 
valuation of long lived assets we evaluate the recoverability of our long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset might not be recoverable 
impairment evaluations involve management estimates of assets useful lives and future cash flows 
when such events occur  we estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
if the undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset  an impairment loss is recognized 
actual useful lives and cash flows could be different from those estimated by our management 
this could have a material effect on our 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations operating results and financial position 
to date  no impairment loss has been recognized 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include the following operating losses  significant negative industry trends  significant underutilization of the assets  and significant changes in how we use the assets or our plans for their use 
accounting for income taxes as of april   we had recorded a valuation allowance of million to offset tax credit carryovers from the exercise of employee stock options 
we believe that it is more likely than not that we will not realize these carryovers 
in the future  if we can utilize the credit and we release the valuation allowance  the tax benefit from this release will be accounted for as a credit to the stockholders equity rather than a reduction of the income tax provision 
for fiscal  there was no income tax provision because we incurred operating losses 
for fiscal and  the income tax provision reflected an effective tax rate of and  respectively 
these rates were less than the combined federal and state statutory rate of approximately because of the reversal of the fiscal valuation allowance  certain tax credits and other factors 
we expect that our consolidated effective tax rate will decrease in fiscal as compared to fiscal and be less than the combined federal and state statutory rates 
achieving an effective tax rate in fiscal that is less than the combined federal and state statutory rates is principally dependent upon the income generated in certain foreign jurisdictions 
litigation and contingencies from time to time  we have been subject to legal proceedings and claims with respect to such matters as patents and other actions arising out of the normal course of business  as well as other matters identified in legal proceedings 
our success and future revenue growth will depend  in part  on our ability to protect our intellectual property 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  as well as nondisclosure agreements and other methods  to protect our proprietary technologies 
we have been issued patents and have a number of pending united states and foreign patent applications 
however  we cannot provide assurance that any patent will be issued as a result of any applications or  if issued  that any claims allowed will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology 
in addition  it is possible that existing or future patents may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
see legal proceedings for a description of the counterclaim ic media has brought against us with respect to one of our foreign patents 
it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology without authorization  develop corresponding technology independently or design around our patents 
effective copyright  trademark and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in foreign countries 
these disputes may result in costly and time consuming litigation or the license of additional elements of our intellectual property for free 
it is possible that other companies might pursue litigation with respect to any claims such companies purport to have against us 
the results of any litigation are inherently uncertain 
in the event of an adverse result in any litigation with respect to intellectual property rights relevant to our products that could arise in the future  we could be required to obtain licenses to the infringed technology  pay substantial damages under applicable law  including treble damages if we are held to have willfully infringed  cease the manufacture  use and sale of infringing products or to expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology 
litigation frequently involves substantial expenditures and can require significant management attention  even if we ultimately prevail 
given the uncertainties associated with litigation  if our assessments prove to be wrong  or if additional information becomes available such that we estimate that there is a possible loss or possible range of loss associated with these contingencies  then we would record the minimum estimated liability  which could materially impact our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations the following table sets forth the results of our operations as a percentage of revenues 
our historical operating results are not necessarily indicative of the results for any future period 
fiscal year ended april  revenues cost of revenues gross margin operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative stock compensation charge litigation settlement total operating expenses income loss from operations interest income  net other income income loss before income taxes provision for income taxes net income loss revenues we derive revenues from the sale of our camerachip products for use in a wide variety of consumer and commercial mass market applications including digital still cameras  cell phones  video game consoles and security and surveillance cameras 
revenues increased to approximately million for fiscal from million for fiscal and increased in fiscal from million for fiscal revenues from sales of camerachips for digital as compared to analog applications 
our camerachips are sold to customers who incorporate them into either digital or analog applications 
examples of digital applications that incorporate our camerachips are digital still cameras  camera phones  personal computer camera applications and digital toy cameras 
examples of analog applications that incorporate our camerachips are security and surveillance cameras and analog toy cameras 
we sell a large portion of our products through vars and distributors  and often we do not know the identity of the manufacturers who ultimately embed our camerachips into their products 
as a result of our sales to vars and distributors and because our camerachips can be used in a wide variety of digital or analog products  we cannot accurately confirm the distribution of our revenues across specific product categories 
however  we are able to confirm the distribution of our revenues by digital and analog product categories  and they are as follows fiscal year ended april  in thousands digital image sensors analog image sensors total comparison of fiscal and fiscal digital revenues 
revenues from sales of camerachips for digital applications increased in fiscal from fiscal and represented in fiscal and of our revenues in fiscal the increase in revenues from sales of camerachips for digital applications in fiscal primarily was due to increases in unit sales of approximately million  or and was led by increases of approximately million  or  in unit sales of lower resolution camerachips products used primarily in cell phone and toy applications  which carry a lower average sales price than camerachips used for digital still camera applications 
we believe that demand in the cell phone market resulted from increased requirements from service providers to include camera 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations functionality on handsets as consumers upgrade their cell phones 
the increase in revenues from sales of high resolution camerachips used primarily for digital still camera applications also resulted from increases in unit sales of million  or  in fiscal the increase in unit sales was partially offset by a decline in average sales prices during fiscal analog revenues 
revenues from sales of camerachips for analog applications increased in fiscal from fiscal and represented in fiscal and of our revenues in fiscal we believe this increase in revenues from sales of camerachips for analog applications in fiscal primarily was due to increases of approximately million  or  in unit sales 
the decline in analog revenues as a percentage of revenues in fiscal resulted from the proportionately greater increase in digital revenues during the period 
such camerachips for analog applications are used primarily in cameras for toys and games and security applications 
the increase in unit sales was partially offset by a decline in average sales prices in fiscal comparison of fiscal and fiscal digital revenues 
revenues from sales of camerachips for digital applications increased in fiscal from fiscal and represented in fiscal and of our revenues in fiscal this increase in revenue from sales of camerachips for digital image sensor applications was due primarily to increased unit sales 
we believe this increase resulted from heightened consumer demand for digital still camera and cell phone products 
analog revenues 
revenues from sales of camerachips for analog applications decreased in fiscal from fiscal and represented in fiscal and of our revenues in fiscal we believe this decrease in sales of camerachips for analog image sensor applications was due primarily to decreased demand for our camerachips for use in security surveillance cameras 
revenues from sales to oems and vars as compared to distributors we sell our camerachips either directly to oems and vars or through distributors 
the following table illustrates the percentage of revenues from sales to oems and vars as compared to distributors in each of fiscal  and fiscal year ended april  oems and vars distributors total oems and vars 
in fiscal  no single oem or var customer accounted for more than of our revenues 
in fiscal  our only oem or var customer that accounted for more than of our revenues was primax electronics products huizhou  or primax  based in china  which accounted for approximately of our revenues in such fiscal year 
in fiscal  our only oem or var customer that accounted for more than of our revenues was x wireless technology  inc  or x  a security and surveillance camera manufacturer  which accounted for approximately of revenues in such fiscal year 
for fiscal and  no other oem or var customer accounted for or more of our revenues 
distributors 
in fiscal  and  our only distributor customer that accounted for more than of our revenues was world peace industrial co 
ltd  or world peace  headquartered in taiwan  which accounted for approximately  and of revenues  respectively 
the fiscal and revenue figures for sales to world peace include purchases by world peace s subsidiary  gaintune  based in hong kong 
for fiscal  and  no other distributor customer accounted for or more of our revenues 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations revenues from domestic sales as compared to foreign sales the following table illustrates the percentage of revenues from sales of our camerachip products to domestic customers as compared to foreign customers in each of fiscal  and fiscal year ended april  domestic sales foreign sales total the majority of our foreign sales is attributable to sales made to customers in asia and  to a lesser extent  in europe 
over time  our sales to asia pacific customers have increased primarily as a result of the continuing trend of outsourcing production to asian manufacturers and facilities 
because of the preponderance of asia pacific manufacturers and the fact that virtually all products incorporating our camerachips are sold globally  we believe that such figures do not accurately reflect geographic distribution of sales of our products into end user markets 
gross profit comparison of fiscal and fiscal gross margin for fiscal and was and of revenues  respectively 
the increase in gross margin for fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily due to lower unit costs as a result of improved efficiency in our production sequence 
for fiscal  approximately million of gross profit was attributable to the sale of previously written off inventory 
excluding the revenues and gross profit from the sale of previously written off inventory  the gross margin for fiscal would have increased to approximately of revenues  as compared to of revenues during fiscal comparison of fiscal and fiscal gross margin for fiscal and was and of revenues  respectively 
the decrease in gross margin for fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily due to the benefit in fiscal from the sale of a relatively larger amount of previously written off inventory  and increased sales of our camerachips in module based products which carry a lower gross profit margin than our sensor arrays sold in chip form 
gross profit for fiscal included a gross profit of approximately million from the sale of inventory that we had written off in the quarter ended january  for fiscal  approximately million of the margin was attributable to gross profit from the sale of previously written off inventory 
excluding the revenues and gross profit from the sale of the written off inventory  the gross margin would have been approximately of revenues for fiscal as compared to of revenues in fiscal the decrease in gross margin on an adjusted basis for fiscal was due to our increased sales of our camerachips in module based products  which carry a lower gross profit margin than our sensor arrays sold in chip form 
the module based product is sold in connection with cell phone applications 
the following table summarizes the effect of sales of previously written off inventory on our gross profits in fiscal  and year ended april  sales of all products gross profit gross margin sales excluding products for which the costs were previously written off gross profit excluding the effect of sales of products for which the costs were previously written off gross margin excluding the effect of sales of products for which the costs were previously written off 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of the previously written off inventory  million was written off in the three months ended january  due to a significant imbalance in the pc camera market 
the following table summarizes the activity with respect to the original million of previously written off inventory in thousands inventory previously written off in fiscal balance at january  sale of previously reserved inventory through april  balance at april  sale of previously reserved inventory during fiscal balance at april  we were able to sell approximately million of this inventory in fiscal primarily due to a build out of internet infrastructure in china that created new demand for pc cameras 
however  we believe there is little opportunity to sell the remaining million of this inventory  primarily because these image sensors are not as technologically advanced as other competing products in this market segment 
research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of compensation and personnel related expenses and costs for purchased materials  designs and tooling  depreciation of computers and workstations  and amortization of computer aided design software  some of which may fluctuate significantly from period to period as a result of our product development cycles 
research and development expenses for fiscal  and were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
as a percentage of revenues  research and development expenses for fiscal  and represented  and  respectively 
comparison of fiscal and fiscal the increase in research and development expenses of approximately million  or  in fiscal as compared to fiscal resulted primarily from a million increase in expenses related to new product development required to improve our current product line and support new product introductions  a million increase in salary and payroll related expenses associated with additional personnel and a million increase in expenses for software  patent prosecution and engineering supplies 
examples of new product development expenses include tape out and prototype runs with our wafer manufacturers 
the decrease in research and development as a percentage of revenues during fiscal was due to the proportionately greater increase in revenues from levels in the prior year 
we anticipate that our research and development expenses will increase in the first six months of fiscal as we develop our next generation of camerachip products and as we continue to grow our business  including our research and development team 
comparison of fiscal and fiscal research and development expenses increased in absolute dollars in fiscal as compared to fiscal principally as a result of salary and payroll expenses associated with additional personnel and new product development to improve our product line and support new product introductions

selling  general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of revenues for fiscal from fiscal as a result of the proportionately greater increase in revenues 
we anticipate that our future selling  general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we continue to grow our business 
comparison of fiscal and fiscal the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses of approximately million for fiscal from fiscal was primarily a result of a million decrease in legal fees associated with patent litigation which was partially offset by an million increase in sales commissions  an million increase associated with sales expenses in asia and an increase of million in salaries and payroll expenses associated with an increase in personnel in sales and administration 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of revenues for fiscal as compared to fiscal as a result of the lower cost and the proportionately greater increase in revenues

interest income  net for fiscal  and was approximately million  million and million  respectively 
increased interest income  net  for fiscal as compared to fiscal resulted from increased investments in interest bearing accounts resulting from approximately million in net proceeds from the issuance of common stock in our follow on public offering in july and cash provided by operating activities  partially offset by lower interest rates 
interest income  net  decreased for fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to a decline in interest rates over such periods 
other income other income for fiscal consisted primarily of proceeds from the settlement of litigation 
we did not have other income in fiscal and provision for income taxes we generated approximately million and million in income before income taxes for fiscal and  respectively 
we recorded a provision for income taxes for fiscal and of approximately million and million  respectively 
we generated losses before income taxes for fiscal and therefore had no provision for income taxes in that year 
for fiscal and  the effective rate was and  respectively 
these rates were less than the combined federal and state statutory rate of approximately because of the reversal of the fiscal valuation allowance  certain tax credits and other factors 
the higher effective tax rate for fiscal as compared to fiscal was due to the release of the valuation allowance in fiscal we expect that our consolidated effective tax rate will decrease in fiscal as compared to fiscal and will be less than the combined federal and state statutory rates 
the decrease in tax rate is due to the anticipated combination of income between domestic and foreign entities in that fiscal year 
liquidity and capital resources principal sources of liquidity at april  consisted of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our working capital increased by approximately million to million as of april  from million as of april  the increase was primarily attributable to a million increase in cash and cash equivalents principally resulting from approximately million in net proceeds from our follow on public offering of common stock in july  a million increase in accounts receivable  net  consistent with the increase in revenues from prior year levels  a million increase in inventories to support future sales  a million increase in short term investments  a million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets and a million increase in restricted cash  partially offset by a million increase in accounts payable  a million increase in deferred income and a million increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities to support increased levels of operations 
for fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities totaled approximately million as compared to million for fiscal  primarily due to net income of approximately million for fiscal as compared to million for fiscal  a million increase in accounts payable  a million increase in deferred income  a million increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities  and a million decrease in refundable and deferred income taxes  which were partially offset by a million increase in accounts receivable  net  a million increase in inventories to support future sales  and a million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets 
the million increase in accounts receivable  net  reflects the significantly higher level of revenues during fiscal  combined with an increase in days of sales outstanding from days as of april  to days as of april  the increase in accounts receivable  net  was partially offset by a million increase in the reserve for sales returns  which rose as a result of the large increase in revenues for fiscal  and by a million increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts  which rose as a result of the large increase in accounts receivable balances 
the million increase in inventories was attributable to higher inventory levels required to support future sales 
inventory turns  calculated based on the fiscal quarters ended april  and  decreased from as of april  to as of april   as we increased inventory levels to reduce supply constraints 
accounts payable increased concurrently with the increase in inventory purchases 
for fiscal  we anticipate that our research and development expenses will increase in the first six months of fiscal as we develop our next generation of camerachip products and as we continue to grow our business 
we also anticipate that our future selling  general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we continue to grow our business 
for fiscal  our cash used in investing activities increased to approximately million from million for fiscal  due to million in purchases of property  plant and equipment  million in net purchases of short term investments  million in purchases of long term non marketable investments and a million increase in restricted cash 
net cash used in investing activities of million for fiscal resulted from million in purchases of property  plant and equipment  million in net purchases of short term investments and million in purchases of long term investments 
the million increase in purchases of property  plant and equipment in fiscal as compared to fiscal was due to the additional investment in buildings  building improvements and machinery and equipment to support the expanding operations of our chinese subsidiary 
for fiscal  net cash provided by financing activities increased to approximately million from million for fiscal the increase was primarily due to approximately million in net proceeds resulting from our follow on public offering of common stock in july and million in proceeds from the issuance and sale of common stock pursuant to the exercise of stock options and employee purchases through our employee stock purchase plan during fiscal as compared to million for fiscal proceeds from the issuance and sale of common stock for fiscal were partially offset by million in refunded deposits related to investments from third parties in our chinese subsidiary 
we currently expect our available cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  together with cash that we anticipate to be generated from business operations  to be sufficient to satisfy our foreseeable working capital requirements 
our ability to generate cash from operations is subject to substantial risks described below under the caption factors affecting future results 
we encourage you to review these risks carefully

factors affecting future results this annual report on form k  including this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  contains forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties that could cause our future business  financial condition or results of operations to differ materially from our historical results or currently anticipated results  including those set forth below 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risks related to our business if we are unable to strengthen our internal controls  there could be a material adverse effect on our operations or financial results 
we have restated our financial statements for the first  second and third quarters of fiscal we have filed form q as for each of these quarters to reflect the restatement of the financial information for such periods 
the restatements arose out of an internal review which was initiated in response to issues raised by an employee 
we notified the audit committee of the board of directors of the issues raised  and the audit committee  with assistance from special legal counsel  conducted its own independent investigation 
as a result of the internal review and the independent investigation  management and the audit committee determined that certain errors had occurred which principally affected the timing of revenue recognition for certain sales 
the independent investigation concluded that there was no evidence of wrongdoing in connection with these errors 
the restatement of our financial results for the first three quarters of fiscal related primarily to two issues identified as part of the internal review and independent investigation 
first  beginning in the second half of fiscal and continuing through the first nine months of fiscal  certain distribution sales  for which we recognize revenue on a sell through basis  were not reported to us by one of our distributors in a timely manner 
additionally  in the second and third quarters of fiscal  during the transition of testing operations and certain international sales functions to overseas locations  some shipments made to customers late in the quarter were incorrectly classified as transferring title upon delivery as opposed to upon shipment  and therefore revenue was not recognized when product was shipped 
both of these issues resulted in delayed revenue recognition 
we have been working with the distributor on the issue regarding the reporting of resales to help ensure that we will receive sell through data from such distributor for the full quarterly period 
we have also worked on training our financial reporting and accounting staff to be more alert to this issue 
in addition  we have conducted training to help ensure that all of our accounting and financial reporting staff are aware of the importance of title transfer verification 
partly in connection with the restatement of our financial statements for the first  second and third quarters for fiscal  our independent registered public accounting firm have identified material weaknesses in our internal controls and procedures relating to errors in our recognition of revenue resulting from incorrectly reviewing distributor reports and from incorrectly applying revenue recognition policies in accordance with title transfer  risk of loss and related shipping terms 
our independent registered public accounting firm also noted a material weakness related to our need to increase our financial reporting and accounting staffing levels to ensure that we can meet our financial reporting obligations given the significant growth in our business in recent periods 
in addition  our independent registered public accounting firm reported additional observations and recommendations with respect to our financial reporting and internal controls 
correcting the identified material weaknesses and addressing the other issues identified by our independent registered public accounting firm  responding to the findings of the internal review and the independent investigation and continuously strengthening our internal controls and financial reporting capabilities are some of our highest priorities 
we believe that we have addressed the specific accounting issues identified in the internal review and independent investigation 
in addition  we believe we have improved  and are in the process of further improving  our infrastructure  personnel  processes and controls to help ensure that we are able to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis 
however  our growth in operations will continue to place a strain on our management systems  controls and resources 
to address these issues  we will need to continue to improve our financial and managerial controls  reporting systems and procedures in the future and will need to continue to expand  train and manage our work force company wide  including the size of our accounting and financial reporting staff 
if we are unable to maintain an adequate level of financial processes and controls  we may not be able to accurately report our financial performance on a timely basis and our business and stock price would be harmed 
in addition  we are in the process of instituting changes to our internal procedures in order to satisfy the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act  which requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and a report by our independent registered public accounting firm addressing these assessments 
if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls  as such standards are modified  supplemented or amended from time to time  we may not be able to ensure compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act 
failure to achieve such compliance could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we have been named as defendant in certain litigation matters that could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition 
we are currently a defendant in ongoing litigation matters described in item legal proceedings 
no estimate can be made of the possible loss or possible range of loss  if any  associated with the resolution of these litigation matters 
failure to prevail in these matters could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows in the future 
in addition  the results of litigation are uncertain  and the litigation process may utilize a significant portion of our cash resources and divert management s attention from the day to day operations of the company  all of which could harm our business 
we face intense competition in our markets from more established ccd and cmos image sensor manufacturers  and if we are unable to compete successfully we may not be able to maintain or grow our business 
the image sensor market is intensely competitive  and we expect competition in this industry to continue to increase 
this competition has resulted in rapid technological change  evolving standards  reductions in product sales prices and rapid product obsolescence 
if we are unable to successfully meet these competitive challenges  we may be unable to maintain and grow our business 
any failure to compete successfully would also adversely affect our results of operation and impair our financial condition 
our camerachips face competition from a number of sources  including companies that sell ccd image sensors  as well as other companies that sell cmos image sensors 
many of our competitors have longer operating histories  greater presence in key markets  greater name recognition  larger customer bases  more established strategic and financial relationships and significantly greater financial  sales and marketing  manufacturing  distribution  technical and other resources than we do 
as a result  they may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and customer requirements or devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products 
our competitors include ccd image sensor manufacturers such as fuji  matsushita  nec  sharp  sony  sanyo and toshiba  as well as established cmos image sensor manufacturers such as agilent  canon  ess  fujitsu  hynix  micron  mitsubishi electronic  national semiconductor  philips  samsung  sharp  sony  stmicroelectronics and toshiba 
in addition  we compete with a large number of smaller cmos manufacturers including foveon  ic media corporation  pixart and zoran 
we released a megapixel and megapixel cmos image sensor  as well as a inch low resolution cmos image sensor  for cameraphone manufacturers in february our new releases compete against ccd image sensors  and we cannot guarantee the adoption of our new image sensors by existing or new customers 
we also cannot guarantee the growth of end user markets that would embed these new image sensors 
if our enhanced products and technologies do not gain market acceptance  we may not be able to maintain our market share in this competitive environment 
our competitors may acquire or enter into strategic or commercial agreements or arrangements with foundries or providers of color filter processing  assembly or packaging services 
these strategic arrangements between our competitors and third party service providers could involve preferential or exclusive arrangements for our competitors 
as a result  these strategic alliances could impair our ability to secure sufficient capacity from 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations foundries and service providers to meet our demand for wafer manufacturing  color filter processing  assembly or packaging services  adversely affecting our ability to meet customer demand for our products 
in addition  competitors may enter into exclusive relationships with distributors  which could reduce available distribution channels for our products and impair our ability to sell our products and grow our business 
in addition  some of our customers may also be developers of image sensors  and this could potentially adversely affect our results of operations  business and prospects 
our success depends on the timely development and introduction of new cmos image sensors  which we might not be able to achieve 
the failure to successfully develop new products that achieve market acceptance in a timely fashion would adversely affect our ability to grow our business and our operating results 
in february  we introduced megapixel  megapixel and inch cmos image sensors for camera phones 
we also plan to introduce several new image sensor products in fiscal the development and market acceptance of products such as these are critical to our ability to sustain and grow our business 
any failure to successfully develop and introduce new products could materially adversely affect our business and operating results 
the development of new products is highly complex  and we have in the past experienced delays in completing the development and introduction of new products 
as our products integrate new and more advanced functions  they become more complex and increasingly difficult to design and debug 
successful product development and introduction depend on a number of factors  including accurate prediction of market requirements and evolving standards  including pixel resolution  output interface standards  power requirements  optical lens size  input standards and operating systems for personal computers and other platforms  development of advanced technologies and capabilities  definition  timely completion and introduction of new cmos image sensors that satisfy customer requirements  development of products that maintain a technological advantage over the products of our competitors  including our advantages with respect to the functionality and pixel capability of our camerachips and our proprietary testing processes  and market acceptance of the new products 
accomplishing all of this is time consuming and expensive 
we may be unable to develop new products or product enhancements in time to capture market opportunities or achieve a significant or sustainable acceptance in new and existing markets 
in addition  our products could become obsolete sooner than anticipated because of a rapid change in one or more of the technologies related to our products or the reduced life cycles for consumer products 
our customers experience fluctuating product cycles and seasonality  which could cause our results of operations to fluctuate from period to period 
many of the products using our camerachips  such as digital still cameras  cell phone cameras  personal computer cameras and cameras for toys and games  are consumer electronics goods 
these mass market camera devices generally have seasonal cycles which historically have caused our customers to experience fluctuating product cycles 
as a result  these seasonal buying patterns could cause our results of operations to fluctuate from period to period 
historically  demand from oems and distributors that serve such consumer product markets has been stronger in the second and third quarters of our fiscal year and weaker in the first and fourth quarters of our fiscal year 
if we fail to predict accurately and respond appropriately to this consumer demand on a timely basis to meet seasonal fluctuations  or if there is any disruption of consumer buying habits during these key periods  our business and operating results would be harmed 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations if we do not forecast customer demand correctly  our business could be impaired and our stock price may decline 
our sales are generally made on the basis of purchase orders rather than long term purchase commitments  and we manufacture products and build inventory based on our estimates of customer demand 
accordingly  we must rely on multiple assumptions concerning forecasted customer demand 
we are continually working to improve our sales forecasting procedures 
if we overestimate customer demand  we may manufacture products that we may be unable to sell  or we may have to sell our products to other customers at lower prices 
this could materially and adversely affect our results of operation and financial condition 
in addition  our customers may cancel or defer orders at any time 
we have experienced problems with accurately forecasting customer demand in the past 
for example  beginning in the third quarter of fiscal  the demand for our camerachips for use in pc cameras decreased significantly and one of our significant oem customers unexpectedly cancelled its purchase orders 
on the other hand  if we underestimate customer demand  we may be unable to manufacture sufficient products quickly enough to meet actual demand  causing us to lose customers and impairing our ability to grow our business 
in recent periods  due to higher than anticipated customer demand we have had relatively low levels of inventory  and we have turned over our inventory several times per year 
low levels of inventory could materially impair our ability to meet customer demand for our camerachip products 
as we build our inventory levels  this subjects us to the product obsolescence risks described above 
in preparation for new product introductions  we are gradually ramping down production of established products 
with our day production cycle  it will be extremely difficult to predict precisely how many units of established products we will need 
it will also be difficult to accurately predict the speed of the ramp of new products and the impact on inventory levels presented by the shorter life cycles of newer products 
because of these circumstances  it is possible that we could suffer from shortages for certain products and also build inventories in excess of demand for other products 
our ability to accurately forecast sales is also critical to our ability to meet analyst expectations for our quarterly and annual operating results 
any failure to meet these expectations would likely lead to a substantial decline in our stock price 
we depend on the increased acceptance of cmos technology for mass market image sensor applications  and any delay in the acceptance of this technology could adversely affect our ability to grow our business and increase our revenues 
our business strategy depends in large part on the continued growth of various markets into which we sell our camerachips  including the markets for digital still and video cameras  cell phones  personal digital assistants  personal computers  toys and games  including interactive video games  and commercial and home security and surveillance applications 
our ability to sustain and grow our business also depends on the emergence of new markets for our products such as cameras for automotive applications  personal identification systems  medical imaging devices and embedded applications for personal computers 
if these current and new markets do not grow and develop as anticipated  we may be unable to sustain or grow the sales of our products 
although cmos technology has been available for over years  cmos technology has been used in image sensors only relatively recently 
along with the other risk factors described in this section  the following are examples of factors that may delay the adoption of the cmos fabrication process and our single chip technology for mass market image sensor applications the failure of the emergence of a universal platform for imaging solutions for computers and the internet  improvements in or price reductions for ccd image sensors  which could slow the adoption of cmos image sensors in markets already dominated by ccd image sensors or prevent or delay the adoption of cmos image sensors in emerging markets  the failure of manufacturers that have been using ccd products to adopt our cmos camerachips  and the failure to develop easy to use and affordable products using cmos image sensors 
the occurrence of any of these factors could adversely affect our ability to sustain and grow our business and increase our revenues and earnings 
in addition  the market price of our common stock may be adversely affected if certain of these new markets do not emerge or develop as expected  such as the markets for image sensor products in automobiles and personal identification systems 
securities analysts may have already factored revenue from such new markets into their future estimates of our financial performance and any failure for such markets to develop as expected by such security analysts may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations sales of our camerachips for digital still cameras have accounted for a significant portion of our revenues on both a quarterly and annual basis  and any decline in sales to the digital still camera market or failure for this market to continue to grow as expected could adversely affect our results of operations 
we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from sales to the digital still camera market 
although we can only estimate the percentages of our products that are used in the digital still camera market due to the significant amount of our camerachips that are sold through distributors and value added resellers  we believe that the digital still camera market accounted for approximately of our revenue in fiscal and of our revenue in fiscal we expect that revenues from sales of our camerachips to the digital still camera market will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues during fiscal sales of our camerachips for the digital still camera market are subject to seasonal fluctuations 
any factors adversely affecting the demand for our camerachips in the digital still camera market could cause our business to suffer and adversely affect our results of operations 
the digital image sensor market for digital still cameras is extremely competitive  and we expect to face increased competition in this market in the future 
if we fail to continue to receive design wins with key digital still camera manufacturers  our market share or revenues could decrease 
in addition  digital still camera manufacturers typically purchase digital image sensors through distributors  and we do not have contracts with any distributors that obligate them to sell our products 
such distributors may also sell products of our competitors 
we may not be able to successfully increase or maintain the rate of sales of our camerachip products for digital still cameras through distributors in the future 
the image sensor market for digital still cameras is also subject to frequent technology change 
in order to compete successfully in such market  we will have to correctly forecast customer demand for technological improvements and be able to deliver such products on a timely basis at competitive costs 
if we fail to do this  our results of operation  business and prospects would be materially adversely affected 
in the past  we have experienced problems accurately forecasting customer demand in other markets 
for example  beginning in the third quarter of fiscal  the demand for our camerachips for use in pc cameras decreased significantly and one of our significant oem customers unexpectedly cancelled its purchase orders 
if customer demand in the digital still camera market were to fall suddenly due to oversupply of product or for any other reason  we will be subject to excess inventory risks 
problems with wafer manufacturing yields could result in higher operating costs and could impair our ability to meet customer demand for our products 
if the foundries manufacturing the wafers used in our products cannot achieve expected yields  we may incur higher per unit costs and reduced product availability 
foundries that supply our wafers have experienced problems in the past achieving acceptable wafer manufacturing yields 
wafer yields are a function of both our design technology and the particular foundry s manufacturing process technology 
low yields may result from design errors or manufacturing failures in new or existing products 
we perform a final test of our products after they are assembled  as their optical nature makes earlier testing difficult and expensive 
as a result  yield problems may not be identified until our products are well into the production process 
the risks associated with low yields are exacerbated because we rely on third party offshore foundries for our wafers  which increases the effort and time required to identify  communicate and resolve manufacturing yield problems 
any of these potential problems with wafer manufacturing yields could result in a reduction in our ability to timely deliver products to customers  which could adversely affect our customer relations and make it more difficult to sustain and grow our business 
we depend on a limited number of third party wafer foundries  which reduces our ability to control our manufacturing process 
we do not own or operate a semiconductor fabrication facility 
instead  we primarily rely on tsmc  powerchip semiconductor company  or psc  and other subcontract foundries to produce substantially all of our wafers 
historically  we have relied upon tsmc to provide us with a substantial majority of our wafers 
however  we had never entered into a long term supply agreement with tsmc and instead had traditionally secured manufacturing availability on a purchase order basis 
as a part of our joint venture with tsmc  tsmc has agreed to commit substantial wafer manufacturing capacity to us in exchange for our commitment to purchase a substantial portion of our wafers from tsmc  subject to pricing and technology requirements 
we do not have long term supply agreements with any other foundries and instead secure manufacturing availability on a purchase order basis 
these other foundries have no obligation to supply products to us for any specific period  in any specific quantity or at any specific price  except as set forth in a 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations particular purchase order 
in general  our reliance on third party foundries involves a number of significant risks  including reduced control over delivery schedules  quality assurance  manufacturing yields and production costs  lack of guaranteed production capacity or product supply  unavailability of  or delayed access to  next generation or key process technologies  and financial difficulties or disruptions in the operations of third party foundries due to causes beyond our control 
if tsmc or any of our other foundries were to become unable to continue manufacturing our wafers in the required volumes  at acceptable quality  yields and costs  and in a timely manner  we would have to identify and qualify substitute foundries  which would be time consuming and difficult  and could increase our costs or result in unforeseen manufacturing and operations problems 
in addition  if competition for foundry capacity increases we may be required to pay increased amounts for manufacturing services 
we are also exposed to additional risks if we transfer our production of semiconductors from one foundry to another as such transfer could interrupt our manufacturing process 
further  some of our foundries may also be developers of image sensor products 
if one or more of our other foundries were to decide not to fabricate our interface chips for competitive or other reasons  we would have to identify and qualify additional foundries 
we rely on third party service providers for color filter application and packaging services  which reduces our control over delivery schedules  product quality and cost  and could adversely affect our ability to deliver products to customers 
we rely on tsmc and toppan for the color filter processing of our completed wafers 
in addition  we rely on ase  kyocera  sun yang digital image  or sydi  and impac for substantially all of our ceramic chip packages  which are generally used in our higher priced products 
we rely on another service provider for our plastic chip packages  which are generally used in our lower priced products 
we rely on yet another service provider for chip scale packages  which are generally used in our products designed for the smallest form factor applications 
we do not have long term agreements with any of these service providers and typically obtain services on a purchase order basis 
if for any reason one or more of these service providers becomes unable or unwilling to continue to provide color filter processing or packaging services of acceptable quality  at acceptable costs and in a timely manner  our ability to deliver our products to our customers could be severely impaired 
we would have to identify and qualify substitute service providers  which could be time consuming and difficult and could result in unforeseen operational problems 
substitute service providers might not be available or  if available  might be unwilling or unable to offer services on acceptable terms 
in addition  if competition for color filter processing or packaging capacity increases  we may be required to pay or invest significant amounts to secure access to these services  which could adversely impact our operating results 
there is a limited number of companies that provide these services  some of which have limited operating histories and financial resources 
in the event our current providers refuse or are unable to continue to provide these services to us  we may be unable to procure services from alternate service providers 
furthermore  if customer demand for our products increases  we may be unable to secure sufficient additional capacity from our current service providers on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
moreover  our reliance on a limited number of third party service providers to provide color filter processing services subjects us to reduced control over delivery schedules  quality assurance and costs 
this lack of control may cause unforeseen product shortages or may increase our costs of manufacturing  assembling or testing our products  which would adversely affect our operating results 
historically  our revenues have been dependent upon a few key customers  the loss of one or more of which could significantly reduce our revenues 
historically  a relatively small number of original equipment manufacturers  or oems  value added resellers  or vars  and distributors have accounted for a significant portion of our revenues 
any material delay  cancellation or reduction of purchase orders from one of our major customers or distributors could result in our failure to achieve anticipated revenue for the period 
if we are unable to retain one or more of our largest oem  distributor or var customers  or if we are unable to maintain our current level of revenues from one or more of these significant customers  our business and results of operation would be impaired and our stock price could decrease  potentially 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations significantly 
in fiscal  our only oem or var customer that accounted for more than of our revenues was primax  which accounted for approximately of our revenues in such fiscal year 
in fiscal  no single oem or var customer accounted for more than of our revenues 
in fiscal and fiscal  our only distributor customer that accounted for more than of our revenues was world peace  which accounted for approximately and of our revenues  respectively 
our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows will continue to depend significantly on our ability to retain our current key customers and attract new customers  as well as on the financial condition and success of our oems  vars and distributors 
our ability to deliver products that meet customer demand is dependent upon our ability to meet new and changing requirements for color filter application and sensor packaging 
we expect that as we develop new products to meet technological advances and new and changing industry and customer demands  our color filter application and ceramic  plastic and chip scale packaging requirements will also evolve 
our ability to continue to profitably deliver products that meet customer demand is dependent upon our ability to procure third party services that meet these new requirements on a cost effective basis 
we have historically relied exclusively on third parties to provide these services 
there can be no assurances that any of these parties will be able to develop enhancements to the services they provide to us to meet these new and changing industry and customer requirements 
furthermore  even if these service providers are able to develop their services to meet new and evolving requirements  these services may not be available at a cost that enables us to sustain profitability 
declines in our average sales prices may result in a decline in our revenues and gross margin 
we have experienced and expect to continue to experience pressure to reduce the sales prices of our products  and our average sales prices have declined as a result 
we expect that the average sales prices for many of our products will continue to decline over time 
declines in our average sales prices could result in reduced revenues and a decline in our gross margin  and could materially and adversely affect our operating results and impair our financial condition 
we intend to increase our research and development expenses in an attempt to accelerate the development of our next generation of camerachip products in fiscal however  if we are unable to timely introduce new products that incorporate more advanced technology and include more advanced features that can be sold at higher average sales prices  our financial results will be adversely affected 
we may never achieve the anticipated benefits from our operations in china 
currently  wafer production  color filter application and sensor packaging are performed primarily in asia and  to a limited extent  in israel by third party manufacturers and service providers 
historically  our camerachips have been shipped to our facility in the united states to undergo sensor testing before being shipped to customers 
this process is time consuming and relatively expensive and can result in damaged products 
in december  we established a chinese subsidiary as part of our efforts to streamline our manufacturing process and reduce the costs and working capital associated with the testing of our camerachips 
we have relocated a substantial portion of our automated image testing equipment from the united states to china 
we completed the majority of this transition by the end of fiscal and anticipate that we will complete the remainder of this transition prior to the end of the second quarter of fiscal in addition  we also expect to expand testing capabilities with additional automated testing equipment  which will also be located in china 
however  there are significant administrative  legal and governmental risks to operating in china that could result in increased operating expenses or that could prevent us from achieving our objectives in operations 
consequently  we may never be able to achieve the anticipated cost savings from the transition of testing operations to china 
if our operations in china do not result in offsetting gains in the form of operating cost reductions  whether because of risks and difficulties entailed by foreign operations or for other reasons  our business and financial condition could be adversely affected 
the substantial risks from operating in china that could increase our operating expenses and adversely affect our operating results  financial condition and ability to deliver our products and grow our business include  without limitation difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  particularly in attracting and retaining personnel qualified to design  sell and support cmos image sensors  difficulties in coordinating our operations in china with those in california  diversion of management attention  
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations difficulties in maintaining uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies across our global operations  including inventory management and financial consolidation  political and economic instability  which could have an adverse impact on foreign exchange rates in asia and could impair our ability to conduct our business in china  and inadequacy of the local infrastructure to support our needs 
we may never achieve the anticipated benefits from our joint venture with tsmc 
in october  we entered into an agreement with tsmc pursuant to which we agreed with tsmc to form visera  a joint venture in taiwan  for the purposes of providing manufacturing services and automated final testing services 
we expect that visera will eventually be able to provide us with a committed supply of high quality manufacturing services and automated final testing services at competitive prices 
however  there are significant legal  governmental and relationship risks to forming and developing visera  and we cannot ensure that we will be able to receive the expected benefits from this joint venture 
for example  visera may not be able to provide manufacturing services or automated testing services that have competitive technology or prices  which could adversely affect our product offerings and our ability to meet customer requirements for our products 
in addition  the formation of visera provides us with an additional source for certain manufacturing services which  in the future  may also make it more difficult for us to secure dependable services from competing merchant vendors who provide similar manufacturing services 
we are required to account for our investment in visera under the equity method  and any loss that visera incurs will negatively impact our reported earnings 
we maintain a backlog of customer orders that is subject to cancellation or delay in delivery schedules  and any cancellation or delay may result in lower than anticipated revenues 
our sales are generally made pursuant to standard purchase orders 
we include in our backlog only those customer orders for which we have accepted purchase orders and assigned shipment dates within the upcoming months 
although our backlog is typically filled within two to four quarters  orders constituting our current backlog are subject to cancellation or changes in delivery schedules  and backlog may not necessarily be an indication of future revenue 
any cancellation or delay in orders which constitute our current or future backlog may result in lower than expected revenues 
our operations in china and our joint venture with tsmc will require substantial capital expenditures 
we must meet certain minimal capital requirements applicable to our chinese subsidiary and our joint venture with tsmc 
our chinese subsidiary has million in registered capital  million of which had been funded as of april  the remaining million must be funded by january in addition  we must meet certain financial requirements with regard to visera  our joint venture with tsmc 
we have committed with tsmc and certain employees and affiliates of visera to provide an aggregate of million in total capital to visera  which commitments may be made in the form of cash or asset contributions 
our share of this capital commitment to visera is million and becomes due in stages as visera s business and service capabilities develop over a number of years 
our net cash investment in the joint venture will approximate million 
we will also contribute approximately million of assets to the joint venture  including technology  plant and equipment currently owned by us or to be purchased with funds for existing commercial commitments 
our cash and net asset contributions to visera will be made in three phases 
in the first phase  we contributed million in cash to visera and granted a non exclusive license to certain of our manufacturing and automated final testing technologies and patents 
in the second phase  we will contribute million in cash to visera and grant a non exclusive license to certain of our manufacturing and automated final testing technologies and patents 
in the third phase  we will contribute million in cash and assets to visera and receive back from visera an aggregate cash payment of million 
we expect to fund the capital commitment to our chinese subsidiary and to our joint venture with tsmc through a combination of funds from our available working capital  investments from third parties  or equity or debt financing 
third party financing may not be available to us when and as required or on terms that are favorable to our stockholders and us 
in addition  chinese law may limit the sources that may be eligible to invest in our chinese subsidiary 
in the event we are unable to obtain financing from third parties  the issuance of our equity securities  including securities convertible into our equity securities  would dilute the ownership interests of our existing stockholders  and the issuance of debt securities could increase the risk or the perceived risk of our business 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations issuance of debt securities could also impair our financial condition  and interest payments could have an adverse effect on our results of operation 
we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of our alliances with  and strategic investments in  third parties 
we expect to develop our business partly through forming alliances or joint ventures with and making strategic investments in other companies  some of which may be companies at a relatively early stage of development 
for example  in april we completed an investment in a chip scale packaging service company  and in june we completed an investment in another packaging service company 
in addition  we entered into an agreement with tsmc in october to form a joint venture in taiwan which will provide manufacturing services and automated final testing services 
in may  we entered into an agreement under which a joint venture will be established as a company incorporated under the laws of taiwan 
we will contribute up to million in exchange for an ownership percentage of 
the purpose of the joint venture will be to conduct the business of manufacturing  marketing and selling of certain of our legacy products 
we expect to continue to utilize partnerships  strategic alliances and investments  particularly those that enhance our manufacturing capacity and those that provide manufacturing services and testing capability 
these investments and partnering arrangements are crucial to our ability to grow our business and meet the increasing demands of our customers 
however  we cannot ensure that we will achieve the benefits expected as a result of these alliances 
for instance  we may not be able to receive acceptable quality and or wafer manufacturing yields from these companies  which could result in higher operating costs and could impair our ability to meet customer demand for our products 
in addition  certain of these investments or partnering relationships may place restrictions on the scope of our business  the geographic areas in which we can sell our products and the types of products that we can manufacture and sell 
for example  our agreement with tsmc provides that we may not engage in business that will directly compete with the business of visera 
this type of non competition provision may impact our ability to grow our business and to meet the demands of our customers 
we also may be required to account for some of these investments under the equity method or to consolidate them into our operating results 
under such circumstances  losses that such companies incur could also adversely affect our operating results 
as several of these companies are at a relatively early stage of development  they could incur losses on a quarterly and annual basis 
we may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property and therefore we may lose some of our competitive advantage 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws as well as nondisclosure agreements and other methods to protect our proprietary technologies 
we have been issued patents and have a number of pending united states and foreign patent applications 
however  we cannot provide assurance that any patent will be issued as a result of any applications or  if issued  that any claims allowed will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology 
it is possible that existing or future patents may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
for example  on august  we initiated a patent infringement action in taiwan  roc against ic media corporation of san jose  california for infringement of taiwan patent ni that had been issued to us 
the patent infringement action seeks damages and injunctive relief against ic media corporation 
in response to our patent infringement action  on october   ic media corporation initiated a cancellation proceeding cancellation no 
n in the taiwan intellectual property office with respect to our taiwan patent ni on july   the taiwan intellectual property office made an initial determination to grant the cancellation of taiwan patent ni  which decision was upheld by the taiwan ministry of economic affairs in november in january  we filed an action with the high administrative court of taiwan to reverse the grant of cancellation 
if ic media is ultimately successful  we may lose or suffer diminished rights in the challenged patent 
in addition  if we are not successful in suits in which we claim that third parties infringe our patents or other intellectual property  our competitive position may be adversely affected 
furthermore  it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology without authorization  develop corresponding technology independently or design around our patents 
effective patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in foreign countries 
any disputes over our intellectual property rights may result in costly and time consuming litigation or the license of additional elements of our intellectual property for little or no compensation 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations litigation regarding intellectual property could divert management attention  be costly to defend and prevent us from using or selling the challenged technology 
in recent years  there has been significant litigation in the united states involving intellectual property rights  including in the semiconductor industry 
we have in the past  are currently  and may in the future be subject to legal proceedings and claims with respect to our intellectual property  including such matters as trade secrets  patents  product liabilities and other actions arising out of the normal course of business 
see legal proceeding on page these claims may increase as our intellectual property portfolio becomes larger or more valuable 
intellectual property claims against us  and any resulting lawsuit  may cause us to incur significant expenses  subject us to liability for damages and invalidate our proprietary rights 
in one case we paid million to settle a litigation matter 
these lawsuits  regardless of their outcome  would likely be time consuming and expensive to resolve and could divert management s time and attention 
any potential intellectual property litigation against us could also force us to take actions such as ceasing the sale or use of products or services that incorporate the infringed intellectual property  obtaining from the holder of the infringed intellectual property a license to sell or use the relevant technology  which license may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all  or redesigning those products or services that incorporate the disputed intellectual property  which could result in substantial unanticipated development expenses and prevent us from selling the products until the redesign is completed  if at all 
if we are subject to a successful claim of infringement and we fail to develop non infringing intellectual property or license the infringed intellectual property on acceptable terms and on a timely basis  we may be unable to sell some or all of our products  and our operating results could be adversely affected 
we may in the future initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our intellectual property rights or to determine the scope and validity of our proprietary rights or the proprietary rights of competitors 
these claims could also result in significant expense and the diversion of technical and management attention 
if we do not effectively manage our growth  our ability to increase our revenues and improve our earnings could be adversely affected 
our growth has placed  and will continue to place  a significant strain on our management and other resources 
in particular  we expect that we will continue to face challenges in managing the expansion of our operations in china 
to manage our growth effectively  we must  among other things implement and improve operational  financial and accounting systems  train and manage our employee base  and attract and retain qualified personnel with relevant experience 
in addition  in recent fiscal quarters we have also seen significant growth in the level of our inventory and accounts receivables  net  and  at times  an increase in our days of sales outstanding  primarily as a result of our revenue growth in fiscal and fiscal our failure to effectively manage our inventory levels could either result in excess inventories  which could adversely affect our gross margins and operating results  or lead to an inability to fill customer orders  which would result in lower sales and could harm our relationships with existing and potential customers 
concurrent with the increase in our sales during fiscal  our accounts receivables and days sales outstanding increased 
if we do not manage effectively our accounts receivable  our cash balance and operating results will be adversely affected 
we must also manage multiple relationships with customers  business partners and other third parties  such as our foundries and process and assembly vendors 
moreover  our growth may significantly overburden our management and financial systems and other resources 
we may not make adequate allowances for the costs and risks associated with our expansion 
in addition  our systems  procedures or controls may not be adequate to support our operations  and we may not be able to expand quickly enough to capitalize on potential market opportunities 
our future operating results will also depend on our ability to expand sales and marketing  research and development  accounting  finance and administrative support 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our future tax rates could be higher than we anticipate if the proportion of future operating income generated outside the us by our foreign subsidiaries is less than we expect 
a number of factors will affect our tax rate in the future  and certain of these factors could increase our effective tax rate in future periods  which could adversely affected our operating results 
for example  if our foreign subsidiaries are unable to achieve the levels of operating income in fiscal that we expect  our effective tax rate in fiscal may be significantly higher than the combined federal and state statutory rates or what our effective tax rates have been in prior periods 
our sales through distributors increase the complexity of our business  which may increase our operating costs and may reduce our ability to forecast revenues 
during fiscal and fiscal  approximately and  respectively  of our sales were made through distributors 
selling through distributors reduces our ability to accurately forecast sales and increases the complexity of our business  requiring us to  among other matters manage a more complex supply chain  manage the level of inventory at each distributor  provide for credits  return rights and price protection  estimate the impact of credits  return rights  price protection and unsold inventory at distributors  and monitor the financial condition and creditworthiness of our distributors 
any failure to manage these challenges could cause us to inaccurately forecast sales and carry excess or insufficient inventory  thereby adversely affecting our operating results 
failure to obtain design wins could cause our market share and revenues to decline and could impair our ability to grow our business 
our future success is dependent upon manufacturers designing our camerachips into their products 
to achieve design wins  which are decisions by those manufacturers to design our products into their systems  we must define and deliver cost effective and innovative semiconductor solutions 
our ability to achieve design wins is subject to numerous risks including competitive pressures as well as technological risks 
if we do not achieve a design win with a prospective customer  it may be difficult to sell our camerachips to such prospective customer in the future because once a manufacturer has designed a supplier s products into its systems  the manufacturer may be reluctant to change its source of components due to the significant costs  time  effort and risk associated with qualifying a new supplier 
accordingly  if we fail to achieve design wins with key camera device manufacturers that embed image sensors in their products  our market share or revenues could decrease 
furthermore  to the extent that our competitors secure design wins  our ability to expand our business in the future will be impaired 
our lengthy manufacturing  packaging and assembly cycle  in addition to our customers design cycle  may result in uncertainty and delays in generating revenues 
the production of our image sensors requires a lengthy manufacturing  packaging and assembly process  typically lasting fourteen to sixteen weeks or more 
additional time may pass before a customer commences volume shipments of products that incorporate our image sensors 
even when a manufacturer decides to design our image sensors into its products  the manufacturer may never ship final products incorporating our image sensors 
given this lengthy cycle  we experience a delay between the time we incur expenditures for research and development and sales and marketing efforts and the time we generate revenues  if any  from these expenditures 
this delay makes it more difficult to forecast customer demand  which adds uncertainty to the manufacturing planning process and could adversely affect our operating results 
the assembly and packaging of our image sensors into camera modules further complicates and reduces our ability to control the manufacturing process  and may decrease our gross margins 
some of our camera manufacturer customers request that we deliver our camerachips in the more finished form of camera modules 
this increases the complexity of the overall manufacturing process and  as a result  may result in decreased yields 
we have engaged third party contract manufacturers to assemble and package our image 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations sensors into camera modules  requiring us to manage service provider relationships that have not historically been a part of our business 
if these third party contract manufacturers are unable to provide timely  reliable and high quality assembly and packaging services  we could experience product shortages and be unable to fill customer orders  resulting in loss of revenues  damage to our reputation and an adverse effect on our ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers 
in addition  several of these third party contract manufacturers also sell camera modules directly to third parties 
any of these third party contract manufacturers may decide to reduce or terminate their relationship with us  which could create product shortages for us and result in a loss of revenues and damage to our customer relationships 
moreover  we must purchase and hold in our inventory products that are not related to our semiconductor business in order to deliver our image sensors in a more finished form  which adds complexity to the overall manufacturing process and increases inventory risks 
the gross margin percentage we realize on modules has been lower than the gross margin percentage we have achieved historically on our camerachips  and we expect this to continue 
in addition  if we are unable to realize a premium in the sales price for camera modules compared to our camerachips  our profitability would also be adversely affected 
we have a relatively limited history of profitability and may be unable to maintain our recent levels of profitability 
we have a limited history of profitability and may be unable to sustain our recent levels of profitability 
if we fail to sustain or increase our levels of profitability  our financial condition may be materially and adversely affected  and the trading price of our common stock may decline 
since our inception in  we have achieved profitability on an annual basis only on three occasions  in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal in fiscal we incurred a net loss of million and in fiscal we incurred a net loss of million 
in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  we recorded net income of million  million and million  respectively 
in the future  we expect to incur significant expenses  including expenses related to our research and development efforts  our operations in china and capital commitments to our chinese subsidiary and our joint venture with tsmc  which could impair our ability to sustain profitability 
in addition  as we plan to hire additional personnel throughout various departments of our company  we expect selling  general and administrative and other expenses to increase 
if we fail to attract qualified personnel with relevant experience  our ability to meet competitive challenges and create new products and technology to meet the demands of our customers will be adversely affected 
other risks associated with our business described elsewhere in this section could also affect our ability to sustain profitability  including the possibility that the end markets for our products may not grow at the same rate as they did in fiscal and fiscal if our revenues do not increase or if we cannot effectively control our expenses  we may be unable to sustain profitability at levels consistent with our financial performance in fiscal  if at all 
fluctuations in our quarterly operating results make it difficult to predict our future performance and may result in volatility in the market price of our common stock 
our quarterly operating results have varied significantly from quarter to quarter in the past and are likely to vary significantly in the future based on a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors and other industry risks  many of which are more fully discussed in our other risk factors  include our ability to accurately forecast demand for our products  our ability to achieve acceptable wafer manufacturing yields  the gain or loss by us of a large customer  our ability to manage our product transitions  the availability of production capacities at the semiconductor foundries that manufacture our products or components of our products  the growth of the market for products and applications using cmos image sensors  the timing and size of orders from our customers  the volume of our product returns  the seasonal nature of customer demand for our products  the deferral of customer orders in anticipation of new products  product designs or enhancements by us  and 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the announcement and introduction of products and technologies by our competitors 
in addition  our introduction of new products and our product mix have affected and may continue to affect our quarterly operating results 
changes in our product mix could adversely affect our operating results  because some products provide higher margins than others 
we typically experience lower yields when manufacturing new products through the initial production phase  and consequently our gross margins on new products have historically been lower than our gross margins on our more established products 
we also anticipate that the rate of orders from our customers may vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
our expenses  including our future capital commitments to our chinese subsidiary and our joint venture with tsmc  and our inventory levels are based on our expectations of future revenues and are relatively fixed 
consequently  if we do not achieve revenues in any quarter as expected  expenses and inventory levels could be disproportionately high  and our operating results for that quarter  and potentially future quarters  may be harmed 
any one or more of these factors is difficult to forecast and could result in fluctuations in our quarterly operating results 
our operating results in a given quarter could be substantially less than anticipated  and  if we fail to meet market analyst expectations  a substantial decline in our stock price could result 
fluctuations in our quarterly operating results could adversely affect the price of our common stock in a manner unrelated to our long term operating performance 
we face foreign business  political and economic risks  because a majority of our products and those of our customers are manufactured and sold outside of the united states 
we face difficulties in managing our third party foundries  color filter application service providers  ceramic and plastic packaging service providers and our foreign distributors  most of whom are located in asia 
potential political and economic instability in asia may have an adverse impact on foreign exchange rates and could cause service disruptions for our vendors and distributors 
sales outside of the united states accounted for approximately  and of our revenues for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
we anticipate that sales outside of the united states will continue to account for a substantial portion of our revenues in future periods 
dependence on sales to foreign customers involves certain risks  including longer payment cycles  the adverse effects of tariffs  duties  price controls or other restrictions that impair trade  decreased visibility as to future demand  difficulties in accounts receivable collections  and burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and labor practices 
sales of our products have been denominated to date exclusively in us dollars 
therefore  increases in the value of the us dollar will increase the price of our products in the currency of the countries in which our customers are located 
this may result in our customers seeking lower priced suppliers  which could adversely impact our operating results 
a portion of our international revenues may be denominated in foreign currencies in the future  which would subject us to risks associated with fluctuations in those foreign currencies 
we may experience integration or other problems with potential acquisitions  which could have an adverse effect on our business or results of operations 
new acquisitions could dilute the interests of existing stockholders  and the announcement of new acquisitions could result in a decline in the price of our common stock 
we may in the future make acquisitions of or large investments in businesses that offer products  services and technologies that we believe would complement our products  including other cmos image sensor manufacturers 
we may also make acquisitions of or investments in businesses that we believe could expand our distribution channels 
even if we were to announce an acquisition  we may not be able to complete it 
additionally  any future acquisition or substantial investment would present numerous risks  including difficulty in integrating the technology  operations or work force of the acquired business with our existing business  
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations disruption of our ongoing business  difficulty in realizing the potential financial or strategic benefits of the transaction  difficulty in maintaining uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies  possible impairment of relationships with employees  customers  suppliers and strategic partners as a result of integration of new businesses and management personnel  and impairment of assets related to resulting goodwill  and reductions in our future operating results from amortization of intangible assets 
we expect that any future acquisitions could provide for consideration to be paid in cash  shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and our common stock 
if consideration for a transaction is paid in common stock  this would further dilute our existing stockholders 
the implementation of our enterprise resource planning system presents certain risks and financial requirements 
we are currently implementing an enterprise resource planning  or erp  system which is critical to the accounting and financial functions of our company 
our erp system imposes certain financial and various other demands due to the cost of implementation 
the erp system also imposes certain risks inherent in the conversion to a new computer system  including disruption to our accounting controls and problems achieving accuracy in the conversion of electronic data 
failure to properly or adequately address these issues could result in the diversion of management s attention and resources and could materially adversely affect our operating results and impact our ability to manage our business 
the high level of complexity and integration of our products increases the risk of latent defects  which could damage customer relationships and increase our costs 
because we integrate many functions on a single chip  our products are complex and are based upon evolving technology 
the integration of additional functions into the complex operations of our products could result in a greater risk that customers or end users could discover latent defects or subtle faults after volumes of product have already been shipped 
although we test our products  we have in the past and may in the future encounter defects or errors 
delivery of products with defects or reliability  quality or compatibility problems may damage our reputation and ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers 
in addition  product defects and errors could result in additional development costs  diversion of technical resources  delayed product shipments  increased product returns  product warranty costs for recall and replacement and product liability claims against us which may not be fully covered by insurance 
our business could be harmed if we lose the services of one or more members of our senior management team  or if we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel 
the loss of the services of one or more of our executive officers or key employees  or the decision of one or more of these individuals to join a competitor  could adversely affect our business and harm our operating results and financial condition 
our success depends to a significant extent on the continued service of our senior management  in particular  shaw hong  our president and chief executive officer  raymond wu  our executive vice president  john t 
rossi  our vice president of finance and chief financial officer and certain other key technical personnel 
none of our senior management is bound by an employment or non competition agreement 
we do not maintain key man life insurance on any of our employees 
our success also depends on our ability to identify  attract and retain qualified sales  marketing  finance  management and technical personnel  particularly analog or mixed signal design engineers 
we have experienced  and may continue to experience  difficulty in hiring and retaining candidates with appropriate qualifications 
if we do not succeed in hiring and retaining candidates with appropriate qualifications  our revenues and product development efforts could be harmed 
our operations may be impaired as a result of disasters  business interruptions or similar events 
disasters such as earthquakes  water  fire  electrical failure  accidents and epidemics affecting our operating activities  major facilities  and employees and customers health could materially and adversely affect our operating 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results and financial condition 
in particular  our asian operations and most of our third party manufacturers and service providers involved in the manufacturing of our products are located within relative close proximity 
therefore  any disaster that strikes within close proximity of that geographic area could be tremendously disruptive to our business and could materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
we do not currently have a disaster recovery plan 
acts of war and terrorist acts may seriously harm our business and revenue  costs and expenses and financial condition 
acts of war or terrorist acts  wherever located around the world  may cause damage or disruption to our business  employees  facilities  suppliers  distributors or customers  which could significantly impact our revenue  costs  expenses and financial condition 
in addition  as a company with significant operations and major distributors and customers located in asia  we may be adversely impacted by heightened tensions and acts of war that occur in locations such as the korean peninsula  taiwan and china 
the potential for future terrorist attacks  the national and international responses to terrorist attacks or perceived threats to national security  and other acts of war or hostility have created many economic and political uncertainties that could adversely affect our business and results of operations in ways that cannot presently be predicted 
we are uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts and acts of war 
risks related to our stock provisions in our charter documents and delaware law  as well as our stockholders rights plan  could prevent or delay a change in control of our company and may reduce the market price of our common stock 
provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage  delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a stockholder may consider favorable 
these provisions include adjusting the price  rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions of preferred stock without stockholder approval  providing for a classified board of directors with staggered  three year terms  requiring supermajority voting to amend some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  limiting the persons who may call special meetings of stockholders  and prohibiting stockholder actions by written consent 
provisions of delaware law also may discourage  delay or prevent another company from acquiring or merging with us 
our board of directors adopted a preferred stock rights agreement in august pursuant to the rights agreement  our board of directors declared a dividend of one right to purchase one one thousandth share of our series a participating preferred stock for each outstanding share of our common stock 
the dividend was paid on september  to stockholders of record as of the close of business on that date 
each right entitles the registered holder to purchase from us one one thousandth of a share of series a preferred at an exercise price of reflecting the stock split that took effect on february  and the amendment to the rights agreement our board of directors approved in june  subject to adjustment 
the exercise of the rights could have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change of control of our company  including  without limitation  discouraging a proxy contest or making more difficult the acquisition of a substantial block of our common stock 
the rights agreement could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for our common stock 
our stock has been and will likely continue to be subject to substantial price and volume fluctuations due to a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control  that may prevent our stockholders from selling our common stock at a profit 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated substantially  and there can be no assurance that such volatility will not continue 
since the beginning of fiscal  the trading price of our common stock has ranged from a high of per share to a low of per share 
the closing sales price of our common stock on july  was 
the securities markets have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations in the past  and the market prices of the securities of semiconductor companies have been especially volatile 
this market volatility  as well as general economic  market or political conditions  could reduce the market price of our common stock in 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations spite of our operating performance 
the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors  including actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results  changes in expectations as to our future financial performance  changes in financial estimates of securities analysts  release of lock up or other transfer restrictions on our outstanding shares of common stock or sales of additional shares of common stock  sales or the perception in the market of possible sales of shares of our common stock by our directors  officers  employees or principal stockholders  changes in market valuations of other technology companies  and announcements by us or our competitors of significant technical innovations  design wins  contracts  standards or acquisitions 
due to these factors  the price of our stock may decline and investors may be unable to resell their shares of our stock for a profit 
in addition  the stock market experiences extreme volatility that often is unrelated to the performance of particular companies 
these market fluctuations may cause our stock price to decline regardless of our performance 
recent accounting pronouncements at its november meeting  the emerging issues task force  or eitf  reached a consensus on disclosure guidance previously discussed under eitf the consensus provided for certain disclosure requirements that were effective for fiscal years ending after december  we adopted the disclosure requirements during our fiscal year ended april  however  we did not have any investments in unrealized loss positions at april   and therefore the disclosure requirements had no implications on our consolidated results of operations 
at its march meeting  the eitf reached a consensus on recognition and measurement guidance previously discussed under eitf the consensus clarifies the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to investments classified as either available for sale or held to maturity under sfas no 
and investments accounted for under the cost method or the equity method 
the recognition and measurement guidance for which the consensus was reached in the march meeting is to be applied to other than temporary impairment evaluations in reporting periods beginning after june  we do not believe that this consensus on the recognition and measurement guidance will have an impact on our consolidated results of operations 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk we sell our products globally  in particular  to branded customers  contract manufacturers  vars and distributors in china  hong kong  japan  korea and taiwan 
all of our transactions with our vendors and customers are carried out in us dollars 
the only expenses the company incurs in currencies other than us dollars are certain costs affecting gross profits  selling  general and administrative and research and development expenses  which are primarily incurred in china  where renminbi rmb is the local currency 
historically  the chinese government has benchmarked the rmb exchange ratio against the us dollar  thereby mitigating the associated foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation risk 
these certain expenses that are denominated in currencies other than us dollars have not historically been a material percentage of our revenues 
we do not believe that our foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation risk is significant  especially if the chinese government continues to benchmark the rmb against the us dollar 
moreover  given that the only expenses that we incur in denominations other than us dollars are certain cost affecting gross profits  selling  general and administrative and research and development expenses which historically have not been a significant percentage of our revenues  we do not believe that a change in foreign currency exchange rates would have a significant effect on our future net income or cash flows 
we have not hedged exposures denominated in foreign currencies or used any other derivative financial instruments as we do not believe that we currently have any significant direct foreign currency exchange rate risk 
although we transact our business in us dollars  future fluctuations in the value of the us dollar may affect the competitiveness of our products  and results of operations 
quantitative and qualitative discussion of market interest rate risk our cash equivalents and short term investments are exposed to financial market risk due to fluctuation in interest rates  which may affect our interest income and  in the future  the fair market value of our investments 
we manage our exposure to financial market risk by performing ongoing evaluations of our investment portfolio 
we presently invest in short term bank market rate accounts  certificates of deposit issued by banks  high grade corporate securities and government bonds maturing approximately months or less from the date of purchase 
due to the short maturities of our investments  the carrying value should approximate the fair market value 
in addition  we do not use our investments for trading or other speculative purposes 
due to the short duration of our investment portfolio  we do not expect that an immediate change in interest rates would have a material effect on the fair market value of our portfolio 
therefore  we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates
