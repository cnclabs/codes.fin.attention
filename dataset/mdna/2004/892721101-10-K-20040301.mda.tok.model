com  prizecade 
com and jewelclaimcenter 
com 
such websites are deployed to generate revenue for our clients in a similar manner as the prizedistributor  inc model described above 
each of these sites is designed to appeal to a specific consumer interest category that we matched with product promotions that appeal to such interest category 
email marketing 
each program that we market for our clients can be implemented not only through the websites  interactive games and pop ups discussed above  but also  and often  through email marketing 
we currently market to a vast database  which includes consumer data that is either owned by us or is managed by us under our revenue share arrangements 
one of the attractive features for clients  and  we believe  a significant competitive advantage  is our ability to create and test a variety of marketing campaigns for prospective and existing corporate clients at no risk to the client 
since we own  and have access to  extensive databases  manage our own internal creative department  and can deliver email at a low cost  we are able to offer prospective and existing clients the opportunity to test market new products  services  price points and creative concepts in order to determine if an on line campaign works for the client  and which campaigns work most effectively 
even after campaigns are fully implemented  we further analyze the marketing results to gauge whether the campaigns are continuing to generate adequate results for the client  whether the media is being utilized cost efficiently  and to determine whether new and different copy is yielding better overall results 
these are traditional direct marketing disciplines that we apply and that we believe when coupled with our proprietary databases  the other databases under our management and our delivery and reporting systems  distinguish us from many of our competitors in the on line marketing industry 
syndication 
we expend a significant portion of our email resources to generate sales for our own products and services and for traffic to our websites 
after we develop a campaign that works efficiently on our own media  we often syndicate the program to third party media 
typically  we have expended time  media and other costs in developing certain campaigns 
in exchange for this invested effort  we obtain the right to market those campaigns to other on line media companies 
we enter into agreements with these other on line media companies to run the campaigns  generally on a fee share arrangement 
we believe such media companies obtain a benefit from receiving an immediately marketable  fully packaged and tested marketing program 
as a result  we believe we maintain the ability to leverage campaigns we have developed including our own products and services so that in future fiscal periods we can generate additional revenue with reduced costs and risks associated with such business extension 
traffix s products and services during the fiscal year ended november   we introduced the on line marketing of our own products and services through the thanksmuch 
com website which sells gift items such as dvd s  cd s and costume jewelry directly to consumers 
when a consumer selects a gift item and tenders his credit card  he is given the opportunity to purchase other  more valuable products and services at special discounts 
we introduced several new business units during the year ended november   including an on line dating program conducted over the internet imatchup 
com and internet based service products such as isp and email accounts that are lec billed txnet and worldwebaccess  inc 
these new business units are designed as monthly recurring revenue billing programs  such as membership to imatchup 
com  our dating site 
no assurances can be given  however  that these new sources of revenue will contribute material revenues and or income from operations in future fiscal periods  if at all 
during the fiscal years ended november  and  the combination of all of these newly introduced services generated approximately million and million  respectively  or approximately and  respectively  of consolidated net revenue 
our expansion in  and dependence on  our on line direct marketing efforts  coupled with the potential for state and or federal legislation limiting our ability to contact consumers on line see business government regulation should all be considered when referring to our current fiscal year s results  as well as prior year s historical results  in evaluating the potential for our future operations  cash flows  and financial position

segment information during the fiscal year ended november   we generated revenue from the following segments e commerce  off line marketing and lec billed products 
the e commerce segment currently represents the core of our business operations 
revenue in the e commerce segment is generated primarily from marketing of third party products and services on our websites and through email 
the off line marketing segment consists of revenue generated by us through off line direct marketing channels which  in fiscal  consisted  exclusively of revenue generated by our majority owned subsidiary  montvale management  llc  which was sold in fiscal 
the lec billed products segment consisted of our proprietary lec billed products  marketed under the brands txnet isp and worldwebaccess  inc these products were introduced during the fiscal year ended november  during the fiscal year ended november   we generated revenue only from the e commerce and off line marketing segments

during the fiscal years ended november  and  this segment consisted exclusively of our majority owned subsidiary  montvale management  llc  and the revenues and expenses of montvale s net branch services provided to qualified mortgage banking and lending institutions 
during the fiscal year ended november  specifically  march  we disposed of our interest in montvale  all as more fully described in note to the attached financial statements

four significant factors contributed to the net decline in consolidated revenue the loss of one of our significant customers in the fourth quarter of fiscal  which customer accounted for approximately million  or  of our revenue for the year ended november   and which customer contributed less than million in revenue for the fiscal year ended november   the sale of our majority owned subsidiary montvale management  llc during the quarter ended may   which subsidiary accounted for approximately million  or of our revenue during the year ended november   compared to million during the year ended november   representing a million  or a decrease  our complete cessation of recognizing revenue from one of our major customers in the quarter ended may  based on the absence of collection probability 
such customer  a public company  accounted for approximately million  or of our revenue during the year ended november   compared to approximately million  or of our revenue during the year ended november  we made our collection assessment during the quarter ended may   based on such customer s publicly filed information 
this assessment included the consideration of amex s may  trading halt of the customer s securities  and its eventual filing for bankruptcy protection on june  see bad debt expense  and a million net revenue decrease in amounts earned in fiscal from the remaining three major customers reported at november  offsetting the above referenced net revenue declines of approximately million were increases in net revenue of approximately million  or of consolidated net revenues for the year ended november   attributable to our online dating service  imatchup 
com  which was initially launched in the first quarter of fiscal  increases in net revenue of approximately million  or of consolidated net revenues for the year ended november   attributable to our lec billed products segment  which was reintroduced to our revenue mix in the first quarter of fiscal and which was inactive in fiscal  and increases in net revenue of approximately million  or of consolidated net revenues for the year ended november  attributable to increases in our revenue earned from new clients acquired in fiscal  and increased spending by other customers existing at november  see transactions with major customers and securities and exchange commission recommended fr disclosures following liquidity and capital resources for a further discussion of the significant customer concentrations  critical accounting policies and estimates  and other factors that could affect future results 
our cost of sales during the years ended november  and were comprised of direct and indirect marketing costs associated with the acquisition and retention of consumers for our databases  including direct response email marketing costs  data purchases  promotional costs and premium fulfillment costs  and contingent based sweepstakes indemnification expense  billing and collection fees and customer service costs

we recognized an approximate million increase in data  profile and premium costs 
such increase was attributable to increases in data and profile costs of approximately million  offset by decreases in premium costs of approximately million 
the premium cost decline was related to our loss of a significant customer  which customer s enrollment based marketing program offered a premium to entice enrollments 
we discontinued conducting business with this significant customer in the fourth quarter of fiscal therefore  fiscal was not burdened with such premium obligation costs 
in addition  fiscal received an approximate benefit of million from the reversal of a portion of the prior year s related premium accrual 
the increase in data and profile costs in fiscal was mainly attributable to the cost of consumer data and profile acquisitions  both directly associated with our increased website activities  specifically at the imatchup 
com website  the atlas websites  prizeamerica 
com and the prizedistributors 
com newly introduced group of sites 
additional increases in the cost of sales were attributable to billing  collection and customer service costs of approximately million associated with our lec billed product activities  which activities were dormant during the fiscal year ended november  the above mentioned increases were offset by an approximate million decrease in email marketing and delivery costs resulting from reduced mailing volumes and improved pricing arrangements with our third party email delivery vendors  and a million decrease in advertising promotion and fulfillment costs associated with the sale of our majority interest in montvale management  llc in the second quarter of fiscal our gross profit in terms of dollars  on a segmental basis  and our gross profit percentage  on a segmental basis  for each of the years ended november  and are set forth below consolidated gross profit  by segment year ended november  change inc dec change inc dec e commerce    off line marketing services    lec billed products and services   consolidated totals    consolidated gross profit percentages  by segment year ended november  absolute percentage change inc dec relative percentage change inc dec e commerce customer acquisition services lec billed products and services consolidated gross profit percentage consolidated gross profit percentage gross margin as a percentage of net revenue was during the year ended november   compared to in the prior year s comparable fiscal period  representing an absolute percentage point decrease of  or a decrease on a relative basis 
the decline in gross profit is primarily attributable to increased data acquisition costs for our imatchup 
com on line dating site and increased marketing and related data acquisition costs for our other website properties and the reintroduction of the lec billed products segment activity  which has a gross profit lower than our historical gross profit 
the impact on gross profit from imatchup 
com results from the expensing of the costs of customer acquisition during the current period eg we pay a third party website a fee for its generating an imatchup free membership account  while recognition of the corresponding revenue is dependent upon whether or not a free account converts to a paying membership  the date of such conversion and the type of membership ie one month  three month or annual memberships 
the imatchup 
com free profiles that convert to billable members generally do so over a period subsequent to their month of acquisition 
therefore  we expect that these future conversions of profiles to billable members  coupled with the amortization of the revenue deferred at november   as well as the anticipated renewal revenues from such acquired customers  should allow us to report improved consolidated gross profit relationships from imatchup in future fiscal quarters

such selling expense item s decreases were primarily related to our ceasing to do business with a significant customer during the fourth quarter of fiscal additional selling expense reductions amounted to approximately million  and related to a reduction in selling expenses attributable to the sale of our majority owned subsidiary  montvale management  llc on march  such majority owned subsidiary was active for the year ended november  segment data general and administrative expenses our general and administrative expenses g a are principally comprised of i compensation costs and related expenses for executive officers  finance  information and operation systems  and general administration personnel  ii professional fees which include legal  audit  accounting and tax  public relations  database management and consulting  and public company related printing costs  iii insurance costs  iv occupancy and other equipment rental costs  v site development  maintenance and modification costs related to our various active segments  and vi all other general and miscellaneous corporate expense items

provisions for bad debts are also recorded resulting from the review of other factors  including a length of time the receivables are past due  b historical experience and c other factors obtained during collection efforts

provision for income taxes we provide for income taxes at the end of each interim period based on the estimated effective tax rate for the full fiscal year 
cumulative adjustments to the tax provision are recorded in the interim period in which a change in the estimated annual effective rate is determined 
a final adjustment is made to our provision for income taxes pursuant to the computation of our annual tax provision benefit 
our current year s tax benefit approximates  coupled with pre tax income of approximately  this effective rate relationship  when compared to our historical effective rate of approximately results from several offsetting factors 
we recognized tax benefits from the use of approximately million in previously devalued capital loss carryover deferred tax assets 
such prior year devalued capital loss deferred tax assets were utilized in fiscal to offset the tax expense on the current year s capital gain income of approximately million 
additionally  we benefited from state tax benefits partially offset by foreign income tax expense 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further details of the tax expense benefit  and deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we are subject to examination by taxing authorities in various jurisdictions  and believe that we have adequately provided for all such tax liabilities 
matters raised upon audit from such jurisdictions may involve substantial amounts and could be material 
management considers it unlikely that resolution of any such matters would have a material adverse effect upon our consolidated financial statements 
year ended november  compared to year ended november  our net revenues  on a segmental basis  and with the components of the individual segments  for each of the fiscal years ended november  and  are set forth in the following tables segment data net revenues  by segment component year ended november  change inc dec change inc dec e commerce components grouplotto and other websites    net branch commission fees    email marketing programs    data sales and rentals    sales of jewelry and gifts   internet game development and other    total e commerce    off line marketing service components net branch commission fees    other off line marketing    total off line marketing services    lec billed products and services components entertainment service royalties   enhanced services  principally voice mail   other lec billed services   total lec billed products and services   total consolidated net revenue    consolidated net revenue increased approximately million  or  to approximately million for the year ended november  from approximately million in the year ended november  the primary component of the increase was attributable to an approximate million increase in our e commerce segment net revenues  combined with an increase of approximately million in net revenue from our off line marketing services segment 
such increases were partially offset by a decrease of approximately million in our lec billed product and services legacy segment 
the e commerce segment revenue increase resulted from our increasing focus on generating revenue from our current core business  on line direct marketing 
we expect this segment to continue to represent the substantial part of our revenue in future fiscal periods 
nevertheless  we continue to assess the potential of revenue generation from off line  conventional direct marketing activities and will implement that strategy if deemed beneficial for our company 
currently  we are using our on line databases to enhance third party off line databases through the application of overlay technology  whereby databases are appended to one another  effectively increasing the depth of consumer related information within the appended database 
the growth in our e commerce segment was primarily attributable to approximately million in revenue generated from the segment s email marketing program sub set 
this represented a million increase over the prior year s million in revenue generated from such segment s sub set 
we believe this substantial increase of approximately over the prior year was primarily the result of our acquisition of significant volumes of permission based email records  extension of the quantity and quality of third party client offers being emailed to the databases and greater efficiencies in our email delivery programs 
in the prior year s comparable period  specifically the first three months of the fiscal year ended november   we had been in the early stages of developing and carrying out our online strategy 
the revenue from the email marketing program sub set represented approximately of our consolidated net revenue for the year ended november   as compared to of our consolidated net revenue for the year ended november  during the year ended november   specifically within the period march  to november   we experienced problems with the delivery of our email promotional offers 
these problems caused reduced revenue and income from the e commerce sub segment 
we believe that the significant component of the email delivery problem is attributable to internet service providers that unilaterally block commercial emails from reaching their consumer subscribers 
we have addressed the issue by deploying new reinforced delivery platforms with increased redundancy and expanded diversification using both internal and external emailing resources 
although we have conceived of a number of programs to address this specific problem  there can be no assurance that any of these programs will work effectively  or can be timely implemented 
various state laws exist  and federal legislation is currently pending  that limit our ability to deliver commercial e mail messages to consumers 
the federal trade commission is convening a three day workshop to review commercial e mail practices 
there are presently no federal laws that explicitly regulate sending unsolicited e mail 
the pending federal bills and existing state laws require that certain opt out procedures be included in e mails and prohibit false routing or fictitious address information 
existing state  and pending federal  laws require functioning return e mail addresses and that valid postal addresses be included by the senders of commercial e mail messages 
some states require an adv label in the subject line  and proscribe false header or misleading subject lines 
attorneys general and or consumers are given authority to enforce the state laws 
over half the states have enacted legislation affecting the sending of unsolicited commercial e mail 
if strict federal legislation is subsequently written into law  with its terms specifically limiting our ability to market our offers  we could potentially realize a material adverse impact in future fiscal period net revenue growth  and therefore  profitability and cash flows could be adversely affected 
in november  we received an inquiry from the federal trade commission questioning whether we needed to comply with the graham leach bliley act privacy of consumer information for financial institutions arising from atlas credit group  one of our internet subsidiaries 
we responded by stating that we need not comply with the graham leach bliley act because atlas credit group utilizes advertising from other financial institutions  but is not itself a financial institution as defined under the statute 
we have not received any further comments from the federal trade commission 
thanksmuch 
com  llc  another of our internet subsidiaries  was served with a class action lawsuit in state court in the county of los angeles  california  for damages associated with allegedly violating the state s shipping and handling laws 
this suit was settled in fiscal the settlement offers a certificate to california consumers on future purchases of thanksmuch products and provides a small payment for attorneys fees 
the pennsylvania attorney general s office had requested us to enter into an assurance of voluntary compliance agreement to resolve allegations concerning certain of our sales practices 
the attorney general alleged that our fly free telemarketing program  as well as certain pay per call services  did not adequately disclose to the consumer the terms of the offer being made 
the agreement also provides for a payment to the state in an amount yet to be determined 
discussions with the pennsylvania attorney general s office are on going 
any changes in the internet operating landscape that materially hinders our ability and or cost to deliver commercial email messages to the consumer records in our databases  and the consumer records in the databases of our affiliates  could potentially cause a material impact on net revenue and gross margin and  therefore  our profitability and cash flows could be adversely affected

revenue from our e commerce segment s grouplotto and other web sites sub set for fiscal was million  which was an increase in revenues of million  or  to fiscal million in revenue 
this increase is the result of our shift from low priced click through revenue to higher revenue generating registration  lead generation and on line customer acquisition based revenue 
we generate a significant portion of our site traffic from email marketing 
as discussed in the prior paragraph  any change in the internet operating landscape such as the enactment of additional state and federal legislation that materially hinders our ability and or cost to deliver commercial email messages to consumers could potentially cause a material adverse impact on net revenue and gross margin and  therefore  our profitability and cash flows 
additional increases in our consolidated revenues were attributable to new sub sets added to the e commerce segment during the year ended november  when compared to the year ended november  the combined revenue resulting from the new sub sets amounted to approximately million and is detailed as follows a approximately million of such increase relates to our majority owned subsidiary  montvale management  llc  that provides services under a net branch agreement with licensed mortgage banking and brokerage companies in the acquisition of candidates for new mortgages and the refinancing of existing debt  which subsidiary also conducts the same services off line and recorded approximately million within our off line marketing services segment  b approximately million of such increase relates to the on line sales of jewelry and gifts by our new subsidiary  thanksmuch  inc  which was formed after the acquisition of the assets of a closely held private company on december   all as more fully described in note to the financial statements  c approximately million of such increase relates to the internet game development revenues generated by our new subsidiary  infiknowledge ulc  which was formed after the acquisition of the assets of a closely held private canadian company on december   all as more fully described in note to the financial statements  and d the balance of such increase  or approximately million  was attributable to a web marketing  design and development contract executed and completed by us during the three months ended february  the increases in revenues from our e commerce segment and off line marketing services segment were partially offset by a decrease of approximately million in revenues from our lec billed products and services segment 
a portion of the decrease  or approximately million  resulted from the expiration in the three months ended february   of certain agreements pursuant to which we had been paid a royalty fee with virtually no corresponding costs to refrain from conducting  marketing  advertising or promoting certain lec billed products and services 
fiscal did not include any revenue related to these services  but we do expect such segment to become active again during the first quarter of fiscal  resulting from the marketing of our products and services that will be billed to consumers on their phone bills through the lecs 
the balance of the decrease in lec billed product and service segment revenue  or approximately million  resulted from our elimination of billing voice mail services under our contract with the service bureau federal transtel  inc ftt in october ftt has since filed for protection under the united states bankruptcy code

our continuing strategy of generating revenues primarily from direct marketing campaigns delivered on line was the significant factor contributing to this increase 
we realized marketing costs for email delivery of approximately million in the year ended november   representing an increase of approximately million  or  when compared to approximately million in email delivery costs incurred in the year ended november  in december  we acquired the assets of a canadian based technology company infiknowledge 
we believe that the integration of infiknowledge s assets  technology and human resources into our operations and email delivery platform will continue to reduce the unitary costs of our email promotions and serve to preserve and or improve operating margins 
see the preceding net revenue section for a further discussion of recent business and legal developments attributable to email marketing 
we realized costs of approximately million for data purchases necessary to build and maintain our marketing databases and approximately million for premium costs related to premium redemption obligations for certain of our marketing program offers 
these costs represent an increase of approximately million  or  over data purchase and fulfillment costs of approximately million incurred during the year ended november  the costs associated with data purchase increases were due  in combination  to our a increasing the volume of data acquired for our marketing activities and b our increased allocation of data purchases for opt in data 
the growth in fiscal premium costs to million  when compared to approximately  incurred in fiscal  resulted from us commencing a new long distance customer acquisition program for a major long distance company in october customer acquisitions under the program were incentivized through the company s issuance of premiums fulfillment costs 
the revenues generated from the new marketing agreement accounted for  or approximately million  of our total revenues in fiscal  thereby having the correlative effect of increasing our fulfillment costs during such period 
the fiscal year ended november   did not have a significant customer from which business a fulfillment cost arose 
we use the services of an agency for the provision of indemnification coverage in the event the grouplotto site produces a winner in one of its free on line lottery games 
the costs attributable to the provision of such indemnification coverage decreased in fiscal approximately  or  when compared with fiscal the primary reason for this decrease was due to a slight decrease in the games played at the grouplotto 
com website during the year ended november  when compared to the year ended november  our off line marketing services segment s cost of sales decreased approximately million  or  to approximately million  when compared to approximately million during the year ended november  the fiscal off line marketing service segment s cost of sales result from our majority owned subsidiary  montvale management llc  which was consolidated with our activities effective september  prior to such consolidation  the subsidiary was primarily inactive 
in the fiscal year ended november   our off line marketing services primarily consisted of a contingent marketing fee that became payable upon the settlement of related litigation  in which we were granted an arbitration award  thus triggering the contingency 
the balance of the decrease in cost of goods sold relates to the lec billed product and service segment and amounted to a reduction of  this reduction resulted from our elimination of billing voice mail services under our contract with the service bureau federal transtel  inc ftt in october ftt has since filed for protection under the united states bankruptcy code

on a segmental basis  our e commerce segment realized a decrease in margin in fiscal when compared to fiscal the absolute percentage point decrease resulted from our increased costs associated with data purchases which are fully expensed at the time of receipt and a significant increase in premium fulfillment obligation costs 
we anticipate that the immediate expensing policy regarding data purchases could provide a margin improvement benefit in future fiscal periods through the continued marketing to such acquired data 
the costs of premium fulfillment obligations related to our marketing of a program for a long distance service provider  with such costs approximating million in the year ended november  we began marketing this premium fulfillment sensitive program in the fourth quarter of fiscal  pursuant to which we incurred approximately  in accrued premium fulfillment costs 
offsetting the decrease in gross margins  as described above  our gross margin benefited from the acquisition of the assets of infiknowledge 
com 
the infiknowledge asset acquisition allowed us to develop our own email delivery platform  through which we were able to decrease our reliance on third party email vendors 
by decreasing this third party reliance  we were able to decrease the unitary costs relative to email delivery 
changes in the gross margins generated from our off line marketing services segment and lec product and services segment primarily offset each other in terms of percentage changes

the significant factors contributing to the increase in selling expenses were a increased fee share commissions incurred in our e commerce segment of approximately million  and b increased selling based commissions and compensation costs million and million  respectively arising from the expansion of the e commerce segment s sales force and selling activities 
regarding the increase in fee share commissions  during the fiscal year ended november   we significantly expanded the practice of marketing promotional offers on behalf of our marketing clients clients to third party databases on a fee share commission basis 
the fee share commission relationship generally arises after we conclude a contractual arrangement with a client pursuant to which we modify or develop the copy  offer form and promotional materials for the client s product or service 
we then test the promotion  and agree to deliver a minimum level of new customers  and or targeted leads to the client 
simultaneously with the execution of these contractual arrangements  we often obtain the rights from the client to market its promotions to a list of third parties with whom we have marketing relationships the third parties 
we enter into contracts with each third party with whom we intend to market client promotions 
the terms of these agreements generally provide that the third party has the right to i approve the creative materials for each promotion  ii approve the timing of each promotion s mailing  iii terminate the contract on short notice  and iv reject any promotion for any reason 
each agreement also restricts the third party from doing business with the client other than through our company for the period of time covered by the agreement  and sets forth the terms of the third party s compensation 
payments are performance based only and are either fixed fees paid for each customer or lead generated for the client  or a revenue share that is a percentage of the revenue generated after deduction for certain direct costs by us for marketing that offer to the third party database 
we utilize unique universal resource locater identifier links urls when promotions are mailed to the third party database 
it is the unique url s that form the tracking mechanism by which the client reports results to us  and we are able to account for revenue generated under the fee share arrangement with third parties 
during the fiscal year ended november   the company significantly increased the number of third party databases and lists under management  which is the primary factor contributing to the increase in the fee share commissions expense category 
additionally  the other commission expense category increase was attributable to agency commissions paid on the sales to one of our largest customers  which customer is no longer conducting business with us  see transactions with major customers 
selling expenses within the off line marketing services segment for fiscal increased approximately million  or  when compared to the prior year s comparable period 
this increase is attributable to the activities of our majority owned subsidiary  montvale management  llc

consolidated bad debt expense  by segment year ended november  change inc dec change inc dec e commerce    off line marketing services lec billed products and services   corporate and other   consolidated totals    bad debt expense decreased approximately million  or  to approximately million in fiscal from approximately million in fiscal the reasons behind our increase in bad debt expense when comparing the fiscal year ended november  with bad debt expense realized in the years ended november  and is explained as follows 
from our inception through the fiscal year ended november   our primary revenue sources were lec billed products and services and off line marketing services 
the revenue generated from lec billed products and services was subject to reserve accruals established for anticipated chargebacks  which were estimated and recorded at the time the gross revenue was booked  and were included as a contra revenue as opposed to bad debt expense when calculating the net revenue presented in our statements of operations 
our lec billed products and services did not yield bad debt expense in the classical single line item presentation  based on the fact that the company dealt with the customer indirectly through a billing service bureau and local exchange carrier 
any and all items that might otherwise have been treated as bad debt expense  referred to chargebacks in the lec billing world  were included as a component of contra revenue 
therefore  the revenues earned by us in conducting the lec billed products and services activity did not cause us to record specific bad debt expense  and did not necessitate an allowance for doubtful accounts 
regarding our off line marketing service activities  we had historically billed to and received directly from the major long distance carriers all such off line marketing service revenue 
under these arrangements  we acquired long distance customers for such carriers  billed the carriers and received the payment on such invoices  typically prior to the filing of our quarterly and annual reports that would include such revenue 
therefore  due to our prompt receipt of payment for our invoices through our relationships with such long distance carriers  we were not subject to bad debt expense or the necessity for an allowance for doubtful accounts 
commencing in the fiscal year ended november   we repositioned our marketing and related revenue generating efforts and entered the on line media arena 
as such  we started entering into classical direct trade business relationships with numerous internet based companies  many of which were granted credit and failed to perform  causing us to incur bad debt expense 
this entry into the on line media arena  and the ensuing internet client business failures  were the circumstances that were primarily responsible for the significant additions to our allowance for doubtful accounts and corresponding bad debt expense increases 
specifically  at the inception of our entry into the on line media arena  we believed that it was probable that we would be able to collect our receivables from our internet based clients 
subsequently  due to the inability of many of such clients to survive the collapse of the dot com market  we concluded that the collection of such receivables was no longer probable 
we continuously evaluate the potential of the collectibility of trade receivables by reviewing such factors as deterioration in the operating results  financial condition or bankruptcy filings of our customers 
as a result of this review process  we record bad debt provisions to adjust the related receivables carrying amount to an amount that reflects their probable realizable value 
provisions for bad debts are also recorded resulting from the review of other factors  including a length of time the receivables are past due  b historical experience and c other factors obtained during collection efforts 
if circumstances related to specific customers change  our estimates for bad debt provisions could be further increased

these losses were deemed to be other than temporary 
additionally  during the year ended november   we realized a permanent impairment of approximately million on a long term investment that discontinued its operations in fiscal we believe that we have significantly reduced our exposure to market fluctuations in our investment portfolio by limiting the contents of such portfolio to approximately million in high grade  short term  commercial paper and auction rate securities with yields ranging from to  with maturities of to days  and approximately million in higher risk investments  consisting of common stock equities and real estate investment trust equities

provision for income taxes our effective income tax rate is a result of the combination of federal income taxes at statutory rates  and state taxes  subject to the effects of valuation allowances taken against the realizability of deferred tax assets 
we recorded income tax expense of approximately million for the year ended november  on pre tax income of approximately million 
this equates to an effective tax rate of approximately 
this effective tax rate is similar to our historically recognized tax rate 
in the year ended november   we realized previously devalued deferred tax assets related to capital losses see note to the financial statements for further details of our income tax accounts 
we had recorded income tax expense of approximately million for the year ended november  on a pre tax profit of approximately approximately million 
this effective tax rate relationship is the result of our taking a full valuation allowance during the year ended november  against the future tax benefits attributable to the loss carryovers arising from permanent impairment charges of  incurred during such period 
this deferred tax asset valuation allowance had been recorded during the year ended november   due to the absence of appreciated capital gain property available for the potential generation of capital gain income to offset the net capital losses generated by the impairment charges

the majority of our customers are extended day credit terms 
in limited instances credit is extended to ranges approximating days 
we continually monitor customer adherence to such terms and constantly strive to improve the effectiveness of our collection efforts with the goal of achieving a dso in the day range 
future fiscal periods might not reflect this goal of a day dso  and might exceed the day dso recognized in the quarter ended november  to the extent that our lec billed products segment would contribute an increased amount of revenue and related account receivable in future fiscal periods  our dso would increase  pursuant to the extended collection terms realized in such business activity

revenue recognition  variable costs and bad debts we currently earn the most significant portion of our revenue from the e commerce segment pursuant to marketing agreements with marketing partners and corporate customers 
the provisions of each agreement determine the type and timing of revenue to be recorded 
we invoice our customers in accordance with the terms of the underlying agreement 
revenue is recognized at the time the marketing activity is delivered  or service is provided  net of estimated contractually specified data qualification allowances  when applicable 
such data qualification allowances may include duplications  invalid addresses  and age restrictions  and are recorded as contra revenue 
our revenues are adjusted in later fiscal periods if actual allowances vary from amounts previously estimated 
historically  the variance between actual allowances and previously estimated allowances has been immaterial 
if events were to occur that would cause actual allowances which are recorded as offsets against gross revenue  as contra revenues  in arriving at reported net revenue to vary significantly from those originally estimated and reflected in the financial statements  we could suffer material deterioration in future fiscal period gross margins  and  therefore  our profitability  cash flows and capital resources could be adversely affected 
certain revenue related obligations are recorded at the time revenue is recognized 
they include costs payable to other on line  as well as off line  media companies for generating registered users and consumer data for us  database fee sharing costs under third party database use agreements  email message delivery costs  contingent based prize indemnification coverage ie  sweepstakes payout indemnification  estimated premium fulfillment costs related to a promotion and all other variable costs directly associated with completing our obligations relative to the revenue being recognized 
our actual premium fulfillment estimates have varied from that which were accrued at the time of recording the related revenue 
this is deemed a change in management s estimate  and we take the additional cost  or benefit  on the accrual adjustment in the fiscal period that the variance is determinable 
the fiscal year ended november  included a benefit of approximately  on the adjustment of the premium fulfillment accruals from november  should the internet operating landscape change resulting in a higher costs of acquiring consumer data and registered users for our websites  b higher costs of acquiring data for our marketing partners  compromising such marketing partners ability to maintain adequate sized databases to allow for continued third party database use agreements  c the infiknowledge asset acquisition failing to reduce the cost of our email delivery activities and web development and web hosting service costs  or our being required to depend on third party emailing service bureaus  at a cost in excess of our anticipated costs  or other currently unknown third party influences on our ability to deliver email messages to the records in our databases  or the records in our marketing affiliates databases  d our contingent based prize indemnification premiums for indemnification coverage increasing due to an increase in the number of prize winners at the sites  or as a result of the insurance industry in general  e our accruals for fulfillment obligations arising out of promotions proving to be less than the actual redemptions processed in subsequent fiscal periods  or f unpredictable technology changes or commercial technology applications  then  if any one  or a combination  of the above factors were to materialize  we could suffer material deterioration in future fiscal period revenue growth and gross margins  and  therefore  our profitability  cash flows and capital resources could be materially adversely affected 
revenue recognition is also subject to provisions based on the probability of collection of the related trade accounts receivable 
we continuously evaluate the potential of the collectibility of trade receivables by reviewing such factors as deterioration in the operating results  financial condition  or bankruptcy filings  of our customers 
as a result of this review process  we record bad debt provisions to adjust the related receivables carrying amount to an estimated realizable value 
provisions for bad debts are also recorded due to the review of other factors  including the length of time the receivables are past due  historical experience and other factors obtained during the conduct of collection efforts 
if circumstances change regarding our specific customers on an individual basis  or if demand for internet direct marketing softens  our estimates for bad debt provisions could be further increased  which could adversely affect our operating margins  profitability  cash flows and capital resources 
major customers and disposition of majority owned subsidiary during the fiscal year ended november   we had nine customers in our e commerce segment which  in combination  accounted for approximately million  or of consolidated net revenues during such period  and approximately million  or of consolidated net accounts receivable as of november  the nine major customers accounted for        and of consolidated net revenue for the year ended november  regarding the balance of our customer base  no single customer had net revenues that equaled  or exceeded  of consolidated net revenues for the year ended november  during the year ended november   our business model caused us to move away from significant single  or material multiple  customer reliance  and therefore has minimized the risk regarding singular customer loss 
during the fiscal years ended november  and  we had five and six major customers who accounted for and of revenue  respectively 
in march  we sold our interest  in our majority owned subsidiary  montvale management llc  for million  plus our investment 
pursuant to the terms of the sale  we received million in cash at closing on march  additionally  we received a note from the purchaser for  payable in monthly installments of  we have also received approximately  representing our gaap basis capital account in such majority subsidiary as at november  we also entered into a two year media purchase agreement whereby we agreed to provide certain media lead generation and related services to the continuing owners of montvale for consideration of  per month over the term of the agreement 
we estimate that the cash flow from the media purchase agreement will equal or exceed the cash flows surrendered pursuant to the disposition of the majority owned subsidiary 
our revenues and profitability from operations have historically varied 
our revenues  cost of providing revenues  profit margins and overhead expenses have varied historically among segments  as well as on a consolidated basis 
the revenue allocation among our segments in future periods will most probably be different than our current revenue allocation due to several factors  including consumer tastes  business opportunities  regulatory issues that may exist in future periods  and other currently unknown factors that could impact our revenue generating cycle or cost structure 
therefore  it is difficult to predict revenue and gross margin trends  and their corresponding impact on liquidity and capital resources 
actual trends may cause us to adjust our operating emphasis  which could result in continued period to period fluctuations in our results of operations 
historically  we have been able to rapidly react to changes in the business environment within which we operate 
management responded to these changes as deemed appropriate at the time of change  and as dictated by the nature of such changes 
management s reaction to such changes covered a broad range of business related adjustments  ranging from product mix repositioning and staff reductions  to entire business model overhauls 
based on our current operations and marketing methods  as well as the dynamic  ever changing status of the internet marketing environment  it is conceivable that we would institute changes to our business practices in response to the potential of unforeseen changes in future fiscal periods 
there can be no assurance that any such potential change in response to the above would be successful in its implementation  and there can be no assurance that any such implementation would benefit our operating margins  profitability  cash flows and capital resources 
impairment of goodwill  other intangibles and investment portfolios could impact net income we carry goodwill and other identifiable intangibles on our balance sheet arising from prior year acquisitions 
we are required to review  at least annually  such goodwill and other identifiable intangibles for any asset impairment 
if the review of the goodwill and identifiable intangibles related to the subsidiaries organized to acquire such assets determines that such assets are impaired  then we will be required to recognize an impairment charge on such goodwill necessary to reduce the carrying value of the goodwill to its net realizable value 
should events occur that would give rise to such impairment charge  we would recognize decreased profitability to the extent of such adjustment 
cash flows would not be directly affected by the impairment charge  but cash flows would  most likely  be adversely affected as a result of the facts and circumstances that created the impairment charge 
market fluctuation and debt repayment risk of marketable securities investment portfolio we maintain an investment portfolio that is managed by prominent financial institutions 
the portfolio includes high grade corporate commercial paper and auction rate securities  certificates of deposit  annuities and common stock equities  all of which are held for varying periods of time  pursuant to maturity dates  market conditions and other factors 
the fair value of our investments in the common stock of publicly traded companies as of november  amounted to approximately million 
these investments are subject to market price volatility  in addition to the potential for business failure at the company level 
moreover  due to the economic climate as realized in the united states  and abroad  and difficulties that may be faced by some of the companies in which we have investments  our investment portfolio could be further impaired by the failure of such companies to fulfill their responsibility of adhering to the repayment of principal upon maturity 
additionally  interest income  and corresponding cash flows could be negatively impacted by continued federal reserve bank interest rate reductions
