item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following summary together with the more detailed business information and consolidated financial statements and related notes that appear elsewhere in this form k and annual report and in the documents that we incorporate by reference into this form k 
this document may contain certain forward looking information within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of this information involves risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
overview we manufacture and sell a comprehensive line of safety garments and accessories for the industrial protective clothing market 
our products are sold by our in house sales force and independent sales representatives to a network of over safety and mill supply distributors 
these distributors in turn supply end user industrial customers such as chemical petrochemical  automobile  steel  glass  construction  smelting  janitorial  pharmaceutical and high technology electronics manufacturers  as well as hospitals and laboratories 
in addition  we supply federal  state and local governmental agencies and departments such as fire and police departments  airport crash rescue units  the department of defense  central intelligence agency  federal bureau of investigation  us secret service and the centers for disease control 
our net sales attributable to customers outside the united states were million  million and million  in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
in fiscal  we hired five additional sales personnel  increasing our sales team from nine to fourteen 
although it has taken time to identify and train the new personnel  we believe our increase in net sales in the year ended january  compared to the year ended january  is in part attributable to our increased focus on our internal sales team 
as sales increase  we intend to continue to invest in the hiring of additional sales personnel 
our sales of limited use disposable protective clothing grew approximately in the year ended january  compared to the year ended january   and our expectation is to see continued growth 
we expect that distributors will continue to stock more inventory as economic conditions in the united states continue to improve 
we also expect our net sales to increase as we introduce our tyvek r based products into new industries in which the use of tyvek r is not widespread 
in addition  our net sales are driven in part by government funding and health related events 
our net sales attributable to chemical suits increased and our net sales attributable to fire gear and aluminized apparel increased in the year ended january  compared to the year ended january  these sales increases were driven primarily by grants from the federal government under the fire act of and the bio terrorism preparedness and response act of as part of the homeland security initiatives 
during fiscal  as a result of the sars virus outbreak in various cities in  we sold approximately million of sars related garments in china  toronto  hong kong and taiwan 
the centers for disease control has recommended protective garments be used to protect healthcare workers in the fight against the spread of the sars virus 
in the event of future outbreaks of sars or other similar contagious viruses  such as avian flu in  we have positioned ourselves with increased production capacity 
we have operated manufacturing facilities in mexico since and in china since beginning in  we moved the labor intensive sewing operation for our limited use disposable protective clothing lines to these facilities 
our facilities and capabilities in china and mexico allow access to a less expensive labor pool than is available in the united states and permit us to purchase certain raw materials at a lower cost than they are available domestically 
as we have increasingly moved production of our products to our facilities in mexico and china  we have seen improvements in the profit margins for these products 
we are in the early stages of moving production of our reusable woven garments and gloves to these facilities and expect to complete this process by the third quarter of fiscal as a result  we expect to see profit margin improvements for these product lines as well 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our audited consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  net sales and expenses  and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base estimates on our past experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances and we periodically evaluate these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we derive our sales primarily from our limited use disposable protective clothing and secondarily from our sales of high end chemical protective suits  fire fighting and heat protective apparel  gloves and arm guards  and reusable woven garments 
sales are recognized when goods are shipped to our distributors at which time title and the risk of loss passes 
sales are reduced for sales returns and allowances 
payment terms are generally net days for united states sales and net days for international sales 
inventories 
inventories include freight in  materials  labor and overhead costs and are stated at the lower of cost on a first in  first out basis or market 
provision is made for slow moving  obsolete or unusable inventory 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts to provide for accounts receivable that may not be collectible 
in establishing the allowance for doubtful accounts  we analyze the collectibility of individual large or past due accounts customer by customer 
we establish reserves for accounts that we determine to be doubtful of collection 
income taxes and valuation reserves 
we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate as part of preparing our consolidated financial statements 
this involves estimating the actual current tax in addition to assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatments for tax and financial accounting purposes 
these differences  together with net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits  are recorded as deferred tax assets or liabilities on our balance sheet 
a judgment must then be made of the likelihood that any deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable income 
a valuation allowance may be required to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in the event we determine that we may not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax asset in the future  or that new estimates indicate that a previously recorded valuation allowance is no longer required  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset is charged or credited to net income in the period of such determination 
valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets 
on february   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which provides that goodwill and other intangible assets are no longer amortized  but are assessed for impairment annually and upon occurrence of an event that indicates impairment may have occurred 
goodwill impairment is evaluated utilizing a two step process as required by sfas no 
factors that we consider important that could identify a potential impairment include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the overall business strategy  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles and goodwill may not be recoverable based upon one or more of these indicators of impairment  we measure any potential impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method 
estimating future cash flows requires our management to make projections that can differ materially from actual results 
in fiscal  as a result of our decision to move a portion of our reusable woven garment assembly from the united states to china  we reviewed this portion of our business for impairment 
an impairment was calculated based on estimating the fair value  utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis  resulting in an impairment charge of million  we have no remaining goodwill recorded as of january  self insured liabilities 
we have a self insurance program for certain employee health benefits 
the cost of such benefits is recognized as expense based on claims filed in each reporting period and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported during such period 
our estimate of claims incurred but not reported are based upon historical trends 
if more claims are made than were estimated or if the costs of actual claims increases beyond what was anticipated  reserves recorded may not be sufficient and additional accruals may be required in future periods 
we maintain separate insurance to cover the excess liability over set single claim amounts and aggregate annual claim amounts 
results of operations the following table set forth our historical results of operations for the years ended january   and as a percentage of our net sales 
year ended january  net sales cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses operating profit interest expense  net income tax expense net income year ended january  compared to year ended january  net sales 
net sales increased million  or  to million for the year ended january  from million for the year ended january  the increase was due primarily to an increase in our market share in our tyvek r based product lines as well as an increase in the price of these products beginning in may increased sales were also driven by an improving us economy which increased demand for our products  particularly in the industrial tyvek r markets we serve  and increased demand for our chemical protective suits and fire turnout gear for homeland security purposes 
in addition  as a result of the sars outbreak  we sold our products for the first time in domestic china  which amounted to million in the year ended january gross profit 
gross profit increased million  or  to million for the year ended january  from million for the year ended january  gross profit as a percent of net sales increased to for the year ended january  from for the year ended january   primarily because of cost reductions achieved by shifting production of additional tyvek r based products and chemical suits to china and mexico 
we have increasingly shifted production to these lower cost facilities 
in addition  we increased the price of our tyvek r based products beginning in may  which contributed to an increase in our gross margins for these products 
in the year ended january   we also determined that a portion of our inventory was obsolete 
as a result  we wrote off million of inventory offsetting the factors contributing to an increase in gross profit discussed above 
operating expenses 
operating expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended january  from million for the year ended january  as a percent of net sales  operating expenses remained constant at for the year ended january  and the year ended january  the million increase in operating expenses in the year ended january  compared to the year ended january  was principally due to increased expenses corresponding to our increase in net sales  as well as impairment of goodwill of million 
this was offset by a decrease in bad debt expense of million in fiscal resulting from improvement in the us economy and a reorganization of our credit department 
interest expenses 
interest expenses decreased million  or  to million for the year ended january  from million for the year ended january  the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in average monthly borrowings under our credit facilities 
income tax expense 
income tax expense consists of federal  state and foreign income taxes 
income tax expense increased million  or  to million for the year ended january  from million for the year ended january  the increase was due to a relative increase in our income recognized in the united states as compared to the income recognized in china  where income tax rates are lower 
our effective tax rate was and in the years ended january  and  respectively 
our effective tax rate varied from the federal statutory rate of due primarily to lower foreign tax rates 
net income 
net income increased million  or  to million for the year ended january  from million for the year ended january  the increase in net income was the result of an increase in net sales and increased productivity as a result of shifts in production to our china facilities  partially offset by an increase in costs and expenses due to higher volumes of our products being sold 
year ended january  compared to year ended january  net sales 
net sales increased million  or  to million for the year ended january  from million for the year ended january  the increase in net sales was principally attributable to slowly improving economic conditions and to an increase in the price of our tyvek r based products beginning in april gross profit 
gross profit increased by million  or  to million for the year ended january  from million for the year ended january  gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to for the year ended january  from for the prior year  principally due to an increase in the price of our tyvek r based products beginning in april  which contributed to an increase in our gross margins for these products 
labor and overhead costs also decreased in the year ended january  compared to the year ended january  due to a headcount reduction in our decatur  alabama facility and our continuing shift of production to china  where the labor costs are lower 
this was partially offset by an increase in inventory reserves of million as well as a decrease in our margins on our tyvek r based products in the period between march and april during which we were unable to pass on the tyvek r price increase to our customers 
operating expenses 
operating expenses increased by million  or  to million for the year ended january  from million for the year ended january  as a percent of net sales  operating expenses increased to for the year ended january  from for the year ended january  the million increase in operating expenses for the year ended january  compared to the year ended january  was due primarily to a million increase in freight costs as a result of price increases by our carriers  a million increase in sales commissions as a result of a corresponding increase in our chemical suit sales which have a higher commission rate than our tyvek r based products  and a million increase in bad debt expense as a result of general economic conditions 
these increases were offset in part by a million decrease in labor expenses as a result of increased automation in our manufacturing processes and a million decrease in research and development expenses as a result of the completion of our development of our micromax r products 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended january  from million for the year ended january  this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in average borrowings under our revolving credit facilities and to decreasing interest rates 
income tax expense 
income tax expense increased million  or  to million for the year ended january  from million for the year ended january  the increase was due to a relative increase in our income recognized in the united states as compared to the income recognized in china  where income tax rates are lower 
our effective tax rate was and in the years ended january  and  respectively 
our effective tax rate varied from the federal statutory rate of due primarily to lower foreign tax rates 
net income 
net income increased million  or  from million for the year ended january  from million for the year ended january  the increase in net income was primarily the result of the price increase of our tyvek r based products  offset in part by the increase in operating expenses discussed above 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows as of january  we had cash and cash equivalents of million and working capital of million  an increase of million and million  respectively  from january  our primary sources of funds for conducting our business activities have been from cash flow provided by operations and borrowings under our credit facilities described below 
we require liquidity and working capital primarily to fund increases in inventories and accounts receivable associated with our net sales and  to a lesser extent  for capital expenditures 
net cash provided by operating activities of million for the year ended january  was due primarily to net income from operations of million and an increase in accounts payable of million  offset in part by an increase in inventories of million and an increase in accounts receivable of million 
net cash provided by operating activities of million for the year ended january  was primarily attributable to net income from operations of million and an decrease in inventories of million  offset in part by an decrease in accounts payable of million and an increase in accounts receivable of million 
net cash used in investing activities of million and million in the years ended january  and  respectively  was due to purchases of property and equipment 
net cash provided by financing activities in the years ended january  and was primarily attributable to payments and borrowings under our credit facilities 
credit facilities we currently have two credit facilities o an million revolving credit facility  of which we had million of borrowings outstanding as of april   and o a million revolving credit facility the availability of which reduces incrementally over its year term  of which we had no borrowings outstanding as of april  in november  we entered into a year million term loan which we repaid in full on march  our million revolving credit facility permits us to borrow up to the lower of million and a borrowing base determined by reference to a percentage of our eligible accounts receivable and inventory 
our million revolving credit facility expires on july   and has therefore been classified as a short term liability on our balance sheet at january  borrowings under this revolving credit facility bear interest at the london interbank offering rate libor plus and were approximately million at january  as of april   we had million of borrowing availability under this revolving credit facility 
in january  we entered into a new year million revolving credit facility which expires on january  availability under this facility decreases from million by  each month over the year term and is also subject to the borrowing base limitation discussed above in connection with our million revolving credit facility 
borrowings under this revolving credit facility bear interest at libor plus 
we did not have any borrowings outstanding under this facility at january  as of april   we had million of borrowing availability under this revolving credit facility 
our credit facilities require that we comply with specified financial covenants relating to interest coverage  debt coverage  minimum consolidated net worth  and earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
these restrictive covenants could affect our financial and operational flexibility or impede our ability to operate or expand our business 
default under our credit facilities would allow the lenders to declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable 
our lenders have a security interest in substantially all of our assets to secure the debt under our credit facilities 
as of april   we were in compliance with all covenants contained in our credit facilities 
we believe that cash flow from operations along with borrowing availability under our million revolving credit facility  as well as the expected renewal of our million revolving credit facility  will be sufficient to meet our currently anticipated operating  capital expenditures and debt service requirements for at least the next months 
historically  we have been able to renew our primary credit facility on acceptable terms  but there can be no assurance that such financing will continue to be available or that any renewal will be on favorable terms as favorable as our current facility 
capital expenditures our capital expenditures principally relate to purchases of manufacturing equipment  computer equipment  leasehold improvement and automobiles  as well as payments related to the construction of our facilities in china 
our capital spending plans for fiscal include the last payment on our  square foot facility in jiaozhou  china due to a construction company as payment for the construction of this facility in our facilities in china are not encumbered by commercial bank mortgages and thus chinese commercial mortgage loans may be available with respect to these real estate assets if we need additional liquidity 
we expect our capital expenditures to be approximately million in fiscal contractual obligations we had no off balance sheet arrangements at january  as shown below  at january   our contractual cash obligations totaled approximately million  including lease renewals entered into subsequent to january  payments due by period less than total year years years after years in thousands operating leases    automobiles leased revolving credit facility   total     seasonality our operations have historically been seasonal  with higher sales generally occurring in february  march  april and may when scheduled maintenance occurs on nuclear  coal  oil and gas fired utilities  chemical  petrochemical and smelting facilities  and other heavy industrial manufacturing plants occurs  primarily due to cooler temperatures 
sales decline during the warmer summer and vacation months  and generally increase from labor day through february with slight declines during holidays 
as a result of this seasonality in our sales  we have historically experienced a corresponding seasonality in our working capital  specifically inventories  with peak inventories occurring between september and march coinciding with lead times required to accommodate the spring maintenance schedules 
we believe that by sustaining higher levels of inventory  we gain a competitive advantage in the marketplace 
certain of our large customers seek sole sourcing to avoid sourcing their requirements from multiple vendors whose prices  delivery times and quality standards differ 
in recent years  due to increased demand by first responders for our chemical suits and fire gear  our historical seasonal pattern has shifted 
governmental disbursements are dependent upon budgetary processes and grant administration processes that do not follow our traditional seasonal sales patterns 
due to the size and timing of these governmental orders  our net sales  results of operations  working capital requirements and cash flows can vary between different reporting periods 
as a result  we expect to experience increased variability in net sales  net income  working capital requirements and cash flows on a quarterly basis 
effects of recent accounting pronouncements in november  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others an interpretation of fasb statements no 
  and and rescission of fasb interpretation no 
this interpretation expands on the existing accounting guidance and disclosure requirements for most guarantees  including indemnifications 
it requires that at the time a company issues a guarantee  the company must recognize an initial liability for the fair value of the obligations it assumes under that guarantee if the amount is reasonably estimable  and must disclose that information in its interim and annual financial statements 
the provisions for initial recognition and measurement of the liability are to be applied on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified on or after january  our initial adoption of this statement on january  did not have an impact on its results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
this interpretation provides guidance with respect to the consolidation of certain entities  referred to as variable interest entities  in which an investor is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities  or is entitled to receive a majority of the variable interest entity s residual returns 
this interpretation also provides guidance with respect to the disclosure of variable interest entities in which an investor maintains an interest but is not required to consolidate 
the provisions of the interpretation are effective immediately for all variable interest entities created after january   or in which we obtain an interest after that date 
in october  the fasb issued a revision to this pronouncement  fin r  which clarified certain provisions and modified the effective date from july  to december  for variable interest entities created before february  we believe that the adoption of this pronouncement will have no impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
requires that certain financial instruments that were accounted for as equity under previous guidance must now be accounted for as liabilities 
the financial instruments affected include mandatory redeemable stock  certain financial instruments that require or may require the issuer to buy back some of its shares in exchange for cash or other assets  and certain obligations that can be settled with shares of stock 
sfas no 
is effective for all financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements for the year ended and at january  in december  the fasb issued a revised sfas no 
 employers disclosures about pension and other postretirement benefits  to improve financial statement disclosures for defined benefit plans 
we have adopted sfas no 
 which includes new disclosure requirements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk  including changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates 
to manage the volatility relating to these exposures  we seek to limit  to the extent possible  our non us dollar denominated purchases 
foreign currency risk we are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our purchases and sales in other countries 
to manage the volatility relating to foreign currency exchange rates  we seek to limit  to the extent possible  our non us dollar denominated purchases and sales 
in connection with our operations in china  we purchase a significant amount of products from outside of the united states 
however  our purchases in china are primarily made in chinese yuan  the value of which has been largely pegged to the us dollar for the last decade 
as a result  any currency risks related to these transactions are deemed to be immaterial to us as a whole 
our primary risk from foreign currency exchange rate changes is presently related to non us dollar denominated sales in canada and  to a smaller extent  in europe 
our sales in canada are denominated in us dollars 
if the value of the us dollar increases relative to the canadian dollar  then our net sales could decrease as our products would be more expensive to our canadian customers because of the exchange rate change 
although our sales in china are denominated in the chinese yuan  because this currency has recently been largely pegged to the us dollar  our foreign currency exchange rate risk in china has been minimized 
at this time  we do not manage the foreign currency risk through the use of derivative instruments 
a decrease in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies would not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
as non us dollar denominated international purchases and sales grow  exposure to volatility in exchange rates could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk with respect to our credit facilities  which have variable interest rates based upon the london interbank offered rate 
at january   we had million of borrowings outstanding under these credit facilities 
if the interest rate applicable to this variable rate debt rose in the year ended january   our interest expense would have increased and our income before income taxes would have decreased by less than
