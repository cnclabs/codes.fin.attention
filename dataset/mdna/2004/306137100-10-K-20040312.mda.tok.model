item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition an d results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition an d results of operations contains forward looking statements within the meanin g of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securitie s exchange act of these forward looking statements can be identified by th e use of predictive  future tense or forward looking terminology  such a s believes  anticipates  expects  estimates  plans  may  intends  will  or similar terms 
investors are cautioned that any forward lookin g statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve significan t risks and uncertainties  and that actual results may differ materially fro m those projected in the forward looking statements 
the following discussio n should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and notes t o those financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
overview the year was a year of growth and investment in future growt h for our company 
our revenues increased to million from million in we used these revenues and available cash to fund operations and to inves t in infrastructure to position the company for future growth 
the major areas of investment were in our personnel and ou r facilities 
to continue to create industry leading cutting edge network storag e solutions  we hired additional development engineers and quality assuranc e engineers 
we also hired engineers to design and test the products that are o r will be sold by our oem partners 
continuing to deliver products to meet th e demands of the network storage market is necessary for us to remain competitiv e and to continue our growth 
we also increased our sales force and our technical support team 
a n increased sales force should expand the market exposure for our products 
th e expanded technical support team responds to questions and technical issues fro m end users of our products and from our resellers and oem partners 
providing to p notch technical support to these groups enhances our ability to continue to mak e sales 
end users who are satisfied with our technical support are more likely t o order additional products from us 
resellers and oem partners who are happy wit h our technical support  and whose end users are satisfied  will be less likely t o look to other providers for future products 
in november  we moved our global headquarters to a large r facility in melville  new york 
our previous office space had become inadequat e for our personnel and equipment needs 
our new headquarters has over  square feet  of which we are currently utilizing  square feet 
our leas e provides that we take possession and control of the space in stages  allowing u s to occupy more space as we grow 
because of work done in the space by the prio r tenant  a global computer services provider  we obtained a multi million dolla r technology and office infrastructure at no cost 
this pre built infrastructur e includes computer labs and training rooms 
the building has dual electrica l feeds and diesel powered generators to assure business continuity durin g unexpected events 
we also moved our asia pacific headquarters in taiwan to a large r location 
this move provides the space needed for our growing asia pacifi c presence 
the key factors we look to for our future business prospects are ou r sales pipeline  our ability to establish relationships with key industry oem s and resellers  sales by our oem partners  re orders from existing customers additional orders from resellers  and the growth of the overall market fo r network storage solutions 
our sales pipeline consists of inquiries from end users an d resellers for possible purchases of our products 
our overall sales pipelin e steadily increased for each quarter of compared with the same quarter i n oem relationships are important to us for two main reasons 
first sales by our oem partners contribute to our revenues 
second  having ou r products selected by respected  established industry leaders signals t o potential customers  resellers and other potential oem partners that ou r products are quality products that add value to their enterprise 
during the past year  we announced strategic oem relationships wit h both storagetek and cnt 
each of these partners undertook broad reviews of al l of the competing software solutions available and  after these reviews  eac h selected ipstor to power network storage solutions for their customers 
th e choice of ipstor by these major industry participants again validates the desig n and the capabilities of our products 
in we signed two additional worldwide oem agreements with tw o major technology companies with global presences 
these oems also conducte d in depth evaluations of all available storage software solutions and chos e ipstor 
these four oem relationships are in addition to the oem partnership s we already had with companies including acer  nec  and maxxan 
we will continu e to seek additional oem opportunities in the future 
many enterprises look to value added resellers or solution provider s to assist them in making their information technology purchases 
these reseller s typically review an enterprise s needs and suggest a hardware  software  o r combined hardware and software solution to fulfill the enterprise s requirements 
resellers have wide choices in fulfilling their customers needs we have established strong relationships with many premier resellers 
in we signed agreements with many new resellers worldwide 
we also terminate d relationships with several resellers who we felt were not properly selling ou r products 
we will continue to enter into relationships with resellers and t o discontinue relationships with resellers with whom we are not satisfied 
in  approximately of our sales came from our oem partner s and approximately of our sales came from resellers or distributors 
w e expect an increase in the percentage of sales attributable to oems in a s our oem relationships mature and expand 
the level of re orders from existing end users of our products is a significant measure of customer satisfaction 
information technolog y professionals will only re order products for their companies if they see tha t the products have reduced total cost of ownership and have provided a goo d return on investment 
re orders are thus an indication that our products ar e delivering as promised and that our support is meeting the end users needs 
i n  we began to see re orders from some of our end users 
these end user s ordered additional copies of ipstor or ordered additional options 
if re order s decline  it would indicate that future sales might also decline 
however  th e use of re orders as an analytical tool is somewhat impaired because our oe m partners typically do not provide us with information identifying the end use r for each order 
as service providers to companies  resellers reputations ar e dependent on satisfying their customers needs efficiently and effectively 
i f resellers determine that a product they have been providing to their customer s is not functioning as promised or is not providing adequate return o n investment  or if the customers are complaining about the level of support the y are receiving from the suppliers  the resellers will move quickly to offe r different solutions to their customers 
additional sales by resellers ar e therefore an important indicator of our business prospects 
the network storage solutions market continues to grow 
please se e the discussion on page in addition to growth based on the current demand fo r storage server consolidation and replication  we expect to see growth in backu p acceleration 
some of our strategic industry partners are applying ipstor i n different market segments and on additional platforms 
the demand for disaste r recovery and backup solutions continues to expand 
our partners are offerin g appliances and other solutions powered by ipstor for replication and for virtua l tape library to meet this demand 
we are also seeing growing market acceptance of ip based storag e area networks 
previously  most sans had been based on fibre channel 
we plan t o tap into the growth in this market through sales of our products by ou r strategic partners 
another area of growth is dedicated purpose storage appliances 
storage appliances combine software with hardware to provide single purpos e turnkey solutions to critical data storage needs 
in response to the needs o f our customers and our resellers  we offer for sale various storage appliances please see discussion on page we expect that sales of storage appliances b y resellers and oems will form a higher percentage of our revenues in than i n our critical accounting policies are those related to revenu e recognition and accounts receivable allowances 
as described in note to ou r consolidated financial statements  we recognize revenue in accordance with th e provisions of statement of position  software revenue recognition  a s amended 
software license revenue is recognized only when pervasive evidence o f an arrangement exists and the fee is fixed and determinable  among othe r criteria 
an arrangement is evidenced by a signed customer contract fo r nonrefundable royalty advances received from oems or a customer purchase orde r for each software license resold by an oem  distributor or solution provider t o an end user 
the software license fees are fixed and determinable as ou r standard payment terms range from to days  depending on regional billin g practices  and we have not provided any of our customers extended payment terms when a customer licenses software together with the purchase of maintenance  w e allocate a portion of the fee to maintenance for its fair value based on th e contractual maintenance renewal rate 
we review accounts receivable to determine which are doubtful o f collection 
in making the determination of the appropriate allowance fo r uncollectible accounts and returns  we consider specific past due accounts analysis of our accounts receivable aging  customer payment terms  historica l collections  write offs and returns  changes in customer demand an d relationships  concentrations of credit risk and customer credit worthiness historically  we have not experienced a high level of write offs and returns du e to our customer relationships  contract provisions and credit assessments changes in the credit worthiness of customers  general economic conditions an d other factors may impact the level of future write offs  revenues and ou r general and administrative expenses 
results of operations for the year ended december  compared to th e year ended december  revenues for the year ended december  increased to million compared to million for the year ended december  ou r operating expenses increased from million in to million i n net loss decreased from million in to million in the increase in revenues was mainly due to an increase in demand for our networ k storage solution software 
over of our revenues were generated fro m resellers and distributors and the remaining revenue was derived from oe m partners 
expenses increased in all departments to support our growth 
w e invested in additional employees and our headcount increased from employee s as of december  to employees as of december  we als o invested in infrastructure by purchasing additional computers and equipment an d we moved our headquarters to a larger facility 
revenues software license revenue software license revenue is comprised of software licenses sol d through our oems  value added resellers and distributors to end users and  to a lesser extent  directly to end users 
these revenues are recognized when  amon g other requirements  we receive a customer purchase order and the software an d permanent key codes are delivered to the customer 
we also receive nonrefundabl e royalty advances and engineering fees from some of our oem partners 
thes e arrangements are evidenced by a signed customer contract  and the revenue i s recognized when the software product master is delivered and accepted  and th e engineering services  if any  have been performed 
software license revenue increased to million in fro m million in increased market acceptance and demand for our produc t were the primary drivers of the increase in software license revenue 
a continued increase in the number of our channel partners and oems also helpe d increase our revenues 
we expect our software license revenue to continue t o grow and the percentage of software license revenue derived from our oe m partners to increase 
maintenance  software services and other revenue maintenance  software services and other revenues are comprised o f software maintenance and technical support  professional services primaril y related to the implementation of our software  engineering services  and sale s of computer hardware 
revenue derived from maintenance and technical suppor t contracts is deferred and recognized ratably over the contractual maintenanc e term 
professional services revenue is recognized in the period that the relate d services are performed 
revenue from engineering services is primarily relate d to customizing software product masters for some of our oem partners 
revenu e from engineering services is recognized in the period the services ar e completed 
in and  we had a limited number of transactions in which w e purchased hardware and bundled this hardware with our software and sold th e bundled solution to a customer 
a portion of the contractual fees is recognize d as revenue when the hardware or software is delivered to the customer based o n the relative fair value of the delivered element s 
through december  the software and hardware in bundled solutions have almost always been delivere d to the customer in the same quarter 
maintenance  software services and othe r revenue increased to million in from million in the major factor behind the increase in maintenance  softwar e services and other revenue was an increase in the number of maintenance an d technical support contracts we sold 
as we are in business longer  and as w e license more software  we expect these revenues will continue to increase 
th e majority of our new customers purchase maintenance and support and mos t customers renew their maintenance and support after their initial contract s expire 
maintenance revenue increased from million for the year ende d december  to million for the year ended december  growt h in our professional services sales  which increased from million in t o million in  also contributed to the increase in software services an d other revenues 
this increase in professional services revenue was related t o the increase in our software license customers that elected to purchas e professional services 
additionally  our hardware sales increased from million in to million in this increase was the result of a n increase in demand from our customers for bundled solutions 
we expect maintenance  software services and other revenues t o continue to increase 
cost of revenues amortization of purchased and capitalized software to remain successful in the network storage solutions market  w e must continually upgrade our software by enhancing the existing features of ou r products and by adding new features and products 
we often evaluate whether t o develop these new offerings in house or whether we can achieve a greater retur n on investment by purchasing or licensing software from third parties 
based o n our evaluations we have purchased or licensed various software for resale sinc e amortization of purchased and capitalized software increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ende d december  the increase in amortization expense was due to our purchas e of an additional million of software licenses in as of december  we had million of purchased software licenses that are bein g amortized over three years 
for the year ended december   we recorde d million of amortization related to these purchased software licenses 
as o f december   we had million of purchased software licenses an d recorded approximately million of amortization for the year ended decembe r  related to these purchased software licenses 
we will continue t o evaluate third party software licenses and may make additional purchases  whic h would result in an increase in amortization expense 
the company did not capitalize any software development costs unti l our initial product reached technological feasibility in march at tha t point  we capitalized million of software development costs  which ar e being amortized at the greater of straight line over three years or the ratio o f current revenue of the related products to total current and anticipated futur e revenue of these products 
amortization of capitalized software was  an d  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
cost of maintenance  software services and other revenue cost of maintenance  software services and other revenue consist s primarily of personnel costs and other costs associated with providing softwar e implementations  technical support under maintenance contracts  and training cost of maintenance  software services and other revenues also includes the cos t of hardware purchased for resale 
cost of maintenance  software services an d other revenues for the year ended december  increased by to million compared to million for the year ended december  th e increase in cost of maintenance  software services and other revenue wa s primarily driven by an increase in hardware sales 
as we sold more hardware  ou r hardware costs for resale rose from million in to million i n the increase in cost of maintenance  software services and other revenu e was also due to an increase in personnel 
as a result of our increased sales o f maintenance and support contracts and professional services  we required a higher number of employees to provide technical support and to implement ou r software 
our cost of maintenance  software services and other revenue wil l continue to grow in absolute dollars as our revenue increases 
gross profit for the year ended december  was millio n or of revenues compared to million or of revenues for the yea r ended december  the increase in gross profit was directly related t o the increase in revenues 
the decrease in gross margins was due to the increas e in amortization of purchased software licenses and was also partially related t o margins on hardware sales  which are typically lower than the margins o n software and services 
software development costs software development costs consist primarily of personnel costs fo r product development personnel and other related costs associated with th e development of new products  enhancements to existing products  qualit y assurance and testing 
software development costs increased to millio n in from million in the increase in software development cost s was primarily due to an increase in employees required to enhance and test ou r core network storage software product  as well as to develop new innovativ e features and options 
in addition  as we negotiated and signed new oem partners we required additional employees to test and customize our software with our oe m partners products 
in  we also opened a development office in china t o assist in our development work 
we intend to continue recruiting and hirin g product development personnel to support our development process 
selling and marketing selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of sales an d marketing personnel and related costs  travel  public relations expense marketing literature and promotions  commissions  trade show expenses  and th e costs associated with our foreign sales offices 
selling and marketing expense s increased to million in from million in as a result o f the increase in revenue and interest in our software  our commission expense an d travel expenses increased 
in addition  we continued to hire new sales and sale s support personnel and expand our worldwide presence to accommodate our revenu e growth 
we believe that to continue to grow sales  our sales and marketin g expenses will continue to increase 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personne l costs of general and administrative functions  public company related fees directors and officers insurance  legal and professional fees and other genera l corporate overhead costs 
general and administrative expenses increased t o million in from million in one reason for the increase i n general and administrative expenses is due to an increase in salaries 
as ou r business grew  we required additional general and administrative personnel t o support the growth 
another reason for the increase was due to higher premium s for our directors and officers insurance 
we expect general and administrativ e expenses to continue to increase in order to support the growth of the business interest and other income we invest our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities i n government securities and other low risk investments 
interest and other incom e decreased to million in from million in this decreas e in interest income was due to lower interest rates and lower average cash  cas h equivalent and marketable securities balances 
we expect interest and othe r income to decrease until the time we generate positive cash flows 
income taxes we did not record a tax benefit associated with the pre tax los s incurred from the period from inception february  through december  as we deemed that it was more likely than not that the deferred tax asset s will not be realized based on our early stage of operations 
accordingly  w e provided a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
ou r income tax provision consists of tax liabilities related to our foreig n subsidiaries 
lease abandonment charge in november  we relocated our headquarters to a larger facilit y to accommodate our future growth 
as a result of this relocation  we vacated ou r previous office space and recorded a charge for the estimated loss we expect t o incur on the remaining lease obligation 
the charge of million included th e remaining lease rental obligation reduced by cash flows we expect to generat e from an agreement to sub lease the facility as well as the write off o f leasehold improvements at our previous facility 
this expense is not expected t o recur 
impairment of long lived and other assets in october  we entered into an agreement with network security solutions  inc nssi  a publicly traded company  whereby million was paid to nssi  of which million was for the purchase o f convertible preferred stock of nssi accounted for under the cost method  an d million was for a non refundable prepaid royalty recoupable against futur e product sales of nssi s product 
primarily due to the decline in the marke t value of nssi s common stock underlying the convertible preferred stoc k significantly below the company s cost  we concluded in that the decline i n the fair value of our investment in nssi s preferred stock was other tha n temporary 
accordingly  in we recorded an impairment charge to write of f our investment in nssi preferred stock 
in addition  due to the lack of marke t acceptance of the nssi product  we concluded that the unrecouped prepaid royalt y was not recoverable and it was written off 
as a result  in  we recorded a million charge for the impairment of long lived and other assets related t o our nssi agreement  of which million was an operating expense 
in  w e received a payment from nssi of  in exchange for all of our preferre d stock of nssi  which was reflected as a reduction to the impairment charge i n the statement of operations 
while we continue to hold warrants to purchase nss i common stock  the exercise price of the warrants far exceeds the current marke t price for nssi s common stock 
we do not expect to incur any additional incom e or expenses from this investment 
results of operations for the year ended december  compared to th e year ended december  revenues software license revenue software license revenue increased to million in fro m million in the increase in software license revenue was partially du e to the release of our principal product at the end of the second quarter o f therefore in  we only had two full quarters of software licens e revenue compared to a full year of revenue in another reason for th e increase in software license revenues was due to increased market acceptance o f our product as well as an increase in the number of our channel partners 
maintenance  software services and other revenue maintenance  software services and other revenue increased t o million in from million in the primary reason for th e increase in maintenance  software services and other revenue was an increase i n the number of our maintenance and technical support contracts 
since ou r software was only released at the end of the second quarter of  we ha d limited maintenance and technical support revenue in cost of revenues amortization of purchased and capitalized software amortization of purchased and capitalized software increased fro m million for the year ended december  to million for the yea r ended december  the increase in amortization expense was due to ou r purchase of an additional million of software licenses in as o f december   we had million of purchased software licenses that ar e being amortized over three years 
for the year ended december   w e recorded million of amortization related to these purchased softwar e licenses 
as of december   we had million of purchased softwar e licenses and recorded approximately million of amortization for the yea r ended december  related to these purchased software licenses amortization of capitalized software was  and  for the years ende d december  and  respectively 
cost of maintenance  software services and other revenue cost of maintenance  software services and other revenues increase d to million in from million in the main reason for th e increase in cost of revenues was due to the increase in revenues 
as a result o f the increase in revenues  we required a higher average number of employees t o provide technical support under our maintenance contracts and to help deploy ou r software 
the hardware costs associated with hardware revenue amounted to million in there were no hardware costs in gross profit for the year ended december  was millio n or compared with million or for the year ended december  the absolute dollar increase in gross profit was due to the increase in tota l revenue compared to the prior year 
software development costs software development costs increased to million in from million in the increase in software development costs was mainl y due to an increase in development personnel 
the increase in employees wa s required to enhance and test our core network storage software product  as wel l as to develop new innovative features and options 
selling and marketing selling and marketing expenses increased to million in from million in this increase in selling and marketing expenses wa s due to our product being released during the end of the second quarter of as a result of this release  we expanded our sales force to accommodate ou r revenue growth and we initiated our marketing efforts to promote our product an d create brand awareness 
in addition  as a result of the increase in revenues ou r commission expense increased 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses decreased to million i n from million in the decrease in general and administrativ e expenses was due to a non cash consulting expense for option grants and highe r legal fees in these amounts were partially offset by a significan t increase in premiums for directors and officers insurance in interest and other income interest and other income increased to million in fro m million in this increase in interest income was due to higher averag e cash  cash equivalent and marketable securities balances as a result of th e merger with npi 
income taxes we did not record a tax benefit associated with the pre tax los s incurred from the period from inception february  through december  as we deemed that it was more likely than not that the deferred tax asset s will not be realized based on our development and now early stage operations accordingly  we provided a full valuation allowance against our net deferred ta x assets 
our income tax provision consists of tax liabilities related to ou r foreign subsidiaries 
impairment of long lived and other assets in october  we entered into an agreement with network security solutions  inc nssi  a publicly traded company  whereby million was paid to nssi  of which million was for the purchase o f convertible preferred stock of nssi accounted for under the cost method  an d million was for a non refundable prepaid royalty recoupable against futur e product sales of nssi s product 
primarily due to a decline in the market valu e of nssi s common stock underlying the convertible preferred stock significantl y below the company s cost  we concluded the decline in the fair value of ou r investment in nssi s preferred stock was other than temporary 
accordingly  i n we recorded an impairment charge to write off our investment in nss i preferred stock 
in addition  due to the lack of market acceptance of the nss i product in its current state  we concluded that the unrecouped prepaid royalt y is not recoverable and it was written off 
as a result  in  we recorded a million charge for the impairment of long lived and other assets related t o our nssi agreement  of which million was an operating expense 
liquidity and capital resources our cash and cash equivalents totaled million and marketabl e securities totaled million at december  as of december  we had million in cash and cash equivalents and million i n marketable securities 
the reasons for this decrease in cash and cas h equivalents and marketable securities are discussed below 
because we have no t yet been profitable  the major use of our cash has been to fund operations until we reach profitability  we will continue to use our cash to fun d operations 
in  we made investments in our infrastructure to support ou r long term growth 
we moved our headquarters to a larger facility and mad e investments in property and equipment 
in addition  we increased the tota l number of employees in to support our growth 
as we continue to grow  w e will continue to make investments in property and equipment and will need t o continue to increase our headcount 
in the past  we also used cash to purchas e software licenses and to make acquisitions 
we will continue to evaluat e potential software license purchases and acquisitions and if the righ t opportunity presents itself we may continue to use our cash in these areas 
we currently do not have any debt and our only commitments ar e related to our office leases 
in connection with our acquisition of ip metrics in july  w e must make cash payments to the former shareholders of ip metrics  which ar e contingent on the level of revenues from ip metrics products for a period o f twenty four months subsequent to the acquisition 
in  we made payments t o the former shareholders of ip metrics totaling  as of december  the company has accrued million of additional purchase consideratio n related to sales of ip metrics products 
in october  our board of directors authorized the repurchase o f up to two million shares of our outstanding common stock 
since october  shares have been repurchased at an aggregate purchase price of million 
no shares were repurchased in net cash used in operating activities totaled million for th e year ended december  compared to million for the year ende d december  and million for the year ended december  th e trend of decreasing cash used in operations is the result of our decreasing ne t loss 
in  we incurred a non cash expense of million related to a n impairment of long lived and other assets 
the decrease in net loss is mainl y attributable to our increases in revenues 
in addition to the decrease in ne t loss  our non cash charges  including depreciation and amortization and equit y based compensation increased from million in to million in and million in these increases are mainly due to increases i n property and equipment and purchased software licenses 
these amounts wer e partially offset by increases in our accounts receivable balances of million in  million in and million in the increases i n our accounts receivable balances are due to our revenue growth 
we expect cas h used in operating activities to continue to decrease as our net loss decreases 
net cash provided by investing activities was million in and net cash used in investing activities was million in cas h provided by investing activities in was million 
in  we acquire d million in cash related to our acquisition of npi 
we did not have an y similar transactions in or included in investing activities for eac h year are the sales and purchases of our marketable securities 
these represen t the sales  maturities and reinvesting of our marketable securities 
in th e net cash provided from the net sale of securities was million  in an d the cash used from the net purchase of marketable securities was an d million  respectively 
these amounts will fluctuate from year to yea r depending on the maturity dates of our marketable securities 
the cash used t o purchase property and equipment has increased from million in and to million in the increase in was due to our investment in ou r infrastructure and our relocation of our company headquarters 
the cash used t o purchase software licenses was million in  million in an d million in in  we used million in cash related to tw o acquisitions 
we did not make any similar acquisitions in or w e continually evaluate potential software licenses and acquisitions and we ma y continue to make these investments if we find opportunities that would benefi t our business 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in eac h of and and million in in we received million i n proceeds from the issuance of preferred stock 
in and we did not issu e any preferred stock 
we received proceeds from the exercise of stock options o f million in  million in and million in the company s only contractual obligations relate to its operatin g leases 
the company has an operating lease covering its primary office facilit y that expires in february  the company also has several operating lease s related to a domestic office and offices in foreign countries 
the expiratio n dates for these leases ranges from through the following is a schedule of future minimum lease payments for all operating leases as o f december  year ending december  thereafter  for the years ended december   and  we paid million  million and million  respectively  related to discontinue d operations 
as of december   all significant payments related to ou r discontinued operations have been settled 
based on our increasing revenues  decreasing net loss and decreasin g cash burn rate  we believe that our current balance of cash  cash equivalent s and marketable securities  and expected cash flows from operations will b e sufficient to meet our cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 
impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements in april  the financial accounting standards board fasb determined that stock based compensation should be recognized as a cost in th e financial statements and that such cost be measured according to the fair valu e of the stock options 
the fasb has not as yet determined the methodology fo r calculating fair value and plans to issue an accounting standard that woul d become effective in we will continue to monitor communications on thi s subject from the fasb to determine the impact on our consolidated financia l statements 
in july  the eitf reached a consensus on issue applicability of aicpa sop to non software deliverables 
the consensus wa s reached that sop is applicable to non software deliverables if they ar e included in an arrangement that contains software that is essential to th e non software deliverables functionality 
the adoption of issue effectiv e october  did not have a material impact on our consolidated financia l statements 
risk factors we have had limited revenues and a history of losses  and we may not achieve or maintain profitability 
we have had limited revenues and a history of losses 
for the yea r ended december   we had revenues of million 
for the period fro m inception february  through december  and for the year ende d december   we had net losses of million and million respectively 
we have signed contracts with resellers and original equipmen t manufacturers  or oems  and believe that as a result of these contracts  ou r revenues should increase in the future  although we are unable to predic t whether we will be profitable 
our business model depends upon signin g agreements with additional oem customers  further developing our reseller sale s channel  and expanding our sales force 
any difficulty in obtaining these oe m and reseller customers or in attracting qualified sales personnel will hinde r our ability to generate additional revenues and achieve or maintai n profitability 
failure to achieve anticipated growth could harm our business and operating results 
achieving our anticipated growth will depend on a number of factors some of which include o retention of key management  marketing and technical personnel  o our ability to increase our customer base and to increase the sale s of our products  and o competitive conditions in the storage networking infrastructur e software market 
we cannot assure you that the anticipated growth will be achieved the failure to achieve anticipated growth could harm our business  financia l condition and operating results 
our board of directors may selectively release shares of our common stock fro m lock up restrictions 
currently  approximately million shares of our common stock ar e subject to contractual lock up restrictions expiring on april  ou r board of directors may  in its sole discretion  release any or all of the share s of our common stock from lock up restrictions at any time with or withou t notice 
any release of such shares from lock up restrictions may be applied on a proportionate or selective basis 
if the release is selectively applied  th e stockholders whose shares are not released will be forced to hold such share s while other stockholders may sell 
in addition  the release of any of suc h shares could depress our stock price 
we have significant lease commitments that could impact our profitability 
during the third quarter of  we signed a lease for new offic e space that commenced on november  and continues through february  the lease obligations are substantially greater than our prior leas e obligations 
this commitment could impact our ability to achieve or to maintai n profitability 
due to the uncertain and shifting development of the network storag e infrastructure software market  we may have difficulty accurately predictin g revenue for future periods and appropriately budgeting for expenses 
the rapidly evolving nature of the network storage infrastructur e software market in which we sell our products and other factors that are beyon d our control  reduces our ability to accurately forecast our quarterly and annua l revenue 
however  we use our forecasted revenue to establish our expense budget most of our expenses are fixed in the short term or incurred in advance o f anticipated revenue 
as a result  we may not be able to decrease our expenses i n a timely manner to offset any shortfall in revenue 
our revenues depend in part on spending by corporate customers 
the operating results of our business depend in part on the overal l demand for network storage infrastructure software 
because our sales ar e primarily to major corporate customers  any softness in demand for networ k storage infrastructure software may result in decreased revenues 
the markets for storage area networks and network attached storage are new an d uncertain  and our business will suffer if they do not develop as we expect 
the rapid adoption of storage area networks san and networ k attached storage nas solutions is critical to our future success 
the market s for san and nas solutions are still unproven  making it difficult to predic t their potential sizes or future growth rates 
most potential customers have mad e substantial investments in their current storage networking infrastructure  an d they may elect to remain with current network architectures or to adopt ne w architecture  in limited stages or over extended periods of time 
we ar e uncertain whether a viable market for our products will develop or b e sustainable 
if these markets fail to develop  or develop more slowly than w e expect  our business  financial condition and results of operations would b e adversely affected 
if we are unable to develop and manufacture new products that achieve acceptanc e in the network storage infrastructure software market  our operating results ma y suffer 
the network storage infrastructure software market continues t o evolve and as a result there is continuing demand for new products 
accordingly we may need to develop and manufacture new products that address additiona l network storage infrastructure software market segments and emergin g technologies to remain competitive in the data storage software industry 
we ar e uncertain whether we will successfully qualify new network storag e infrastructure software products with our customers by meeting custome r performance and quality specifications or quickly achieve high volume productio n of storage networking infrastructure software products 
any failure to addres s additional market segments could harm our business  financial condition an d operating results 
our products must conform to industry standards in order to be accepted b y customers in our markets 
our current products are only one part of a san  nas or direc t attached storage das system 
all components of these systems must compl y with the same industry standards in order to operate together efficiently 
w e depend on companies that provide other components of these systems to conform t o industry standards 
some industry standards may not be widely adopted o r implemented uniformly  and competing standards may emerge that may be preferre d by oem customers or end users 
if other providers of components do not suppor t the same industry standards as we do  or if competing standards emerge  ou r products may not achieve market acceptance  which would adversely affect ou r business 
our complex products may have errors or defects that could result in reduce d demand for our products or costly litigation 
our ipstor platform is complex and is designed to be deployed i n large and complex networks 
many of our customers have unique infrastructures which may require additional professional services in order for our software t o work within their infrastructure 
because our products are critical to th e networks of our customers  any significant interruption in their service as a result of defects in our product within our customers networks could result i n lost profits or damage to our customers 
these problems could cause us to incu r significant service and warranty costs  divert engineering personnel fro m product development efforts and significantly impair our ability to maintai n existing customer relationships and attract new customers 
in addition  a product liability claim  whether successful or not  would likely be tim e consuming and expensive to resolve and would divert management time an d attention 
further  if we are unable to fix the errors or other problems tha t may be identified in full deployment  we would likely experience loss of o r delay in revenues and loss of market share and our business and prospects woul d suffer 
failure of storage appliances powered by ipstor to integrate smoothly with en d user systems could impact demand for the appliances 
we have entered into agreements with our resellers and oem partner s to develop storage appliances that combine certain aspects of ipsto r functionality with third party hardware to create single purpose turnke y solutions that are designed to be easy to deploy 
if the storage appliances ar e not easy to deploy or do not integrate smoothly with end user systems  the basi c premise behind the appliances will not be met and sales would be impacte d negatively 
our oem customers require our products to undergo a lengthy and expensiv e qualification process that does not assure product sales 
prior to offering our products for sale  our oem customers requir e that each of our products undergo an extensive qualification process  whic h involves interoperability testing of our product in the oem s system as well a s rigorous reliability testing 
this qualification of a product by an oem does no t assure any sales of the product to the oem 
despite this uncertainty  we devot e substantial resources  including sales  marketing and management efforts  towar d qualifying our products with oems in anticipation of sales to them 
if we ar e unsuccessful or delayed in qualifying any products with an oem  such failure o r delay would preclude or delay sales of that product to the oem  which may imped e our ability to grow our business 
we rely on our oem customers and resellers for most of our sales 
almost all of our sales come from sales to end users of our product s by our oem customers and by our resellers 
these oem customers and reseller s have limited resources and sales forces and sell many different products  bot h in the network storage infrastructure software market and in other markets 
th e oem customers and resellers may choose to focus their sales efforts on othe r products in the network storage infrastructure software market or other markets the oem customers might also choose not to continue to develop or to marke t products which include our products 
this would likely result in lower revenue s to us and would impede our ability to grow our business 
issues with the hardware sold by our partners could result in lower sales of ou r products 
as part of our sales channel  we license our software to oems an d other partners who install our software on their own hardware or on the hardwar e of other third parties 
if the hardware does not function properly or cause s damage to customers systems  we could lose sales to future customers  eve n though our software functions properly 
problems with our partners hardwar e could negatively impact our business 
the network storage infrastructure software market is highly competitive an d intense competition could negatively impact our business 
the network storage infrastructure software market is intensel y competitive even during periods when demand is stable 
some of our current an d potential competitors have longer operating histories  significantly greate r resources  broader name recognition and a larger installed base of customer s than we have 
those competitors and other potential competitors may be able t o establish or to expand network storage infrastructure software offerings mor e quickly  adapt to new technologies and customer requirements faster  and tak e advantage of acquisition and other opportunities more readily 
our competitors also may o consolidate or establish strategic relationships among themselves to lowe r their product costs or to otherwise compete more effectively against us or o bundle their products with other products to increase demand for thei r products 
in addition  some oems with whom we do business  or hope to do business  ma y enter the market directly and rapidly capture market share 
if we fail t o compete successfully against current or future competitors  our business financial condition and operating results may suffer 
our future quarterly results may fluctuate significantly  which could cause ou r stock price to decline 
our future performance will depend on many factors  including o the timing of securing software license contracts and the delivery o f software and related revenue recognition  o the average unit selling price of our products  o existing or new competitors introducing better products at competitiv e prices before we do  o our ability to manage successfully the complex and difficult process o f qualifying our products with our customers  o our customers canceling  rescheduling or deferring significant orders fo r our products  particularly in anticipation of new products or enhancement s from us or our competitors  o import or export restrictions on our proprietary technology  and o personnel changes 
many of our expenses are relatively fixed and difficult to reduce o r modify 
as a result  the fixed nature of our expenses will magnify any advers e effect of a decrease in revenue on our operating results 
our stock price may be volatile the market price of our common stock has been volatile in the pas t and may be volatile in the future 
for example  during the past twelve month s ended december   the market price of our common stock as quoted on th e nasdaq national market system fluctuated between and 
the marke t price of our common stock may be significantly affected by the followin g factors o actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results  o failure to meet financial estimates  o changes in market valuations of other technology companies particularly those in the storage networking infrastructur e software market  o announcements by us or our competitors of significant technica l innovations  acquisitions  strategic partnerships  join t ventures or capital commitments  o loss of one or more key oem customers  and o departures of key personnel 
the stock market has experienced extreme volatility that often has bee n unrelated to the performance of particular companies 
these market fluctuation s may cause our stock price to fall regardless of our performance 
we have a significant amount of authorized but unissued preferred stock  whic h may affect the likelihood of a change of control in our company 
our board of directors has the authority  without further action b y the stockholders  to issue up to  shares of preferred stock on suc h terms and with such rights  preferences and designations  including  withou t limitation restricting dividends on our common stock  dilution of the votin g power of our common stock and impairing the liquidation rights of the holders o f our common stock  as the board may determine without any vote of th e stockholders 
issuance of such preferred stock  depending upon the rights preferences and designations thereof may have the effect of delaying  deterrin g or preventing a change in control 
in addition  certain anti takeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law  among other things  ma y restrict the ability of our stockholders to authorize a merger  busines s combination or change of control 
finally  we have entered into change o f control agreements with certain executives 
we have a significant number of outstanding options and warrants  the exercis e of which would dilute the then existing stockholders percentage ownership o f our common stock 
as of december   we had outstanding options and warrants t o purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock at a weighte d average exercise price of per share 
we also have  share s reserved for issuance under our stock option plans with respect to options tha t have not been granted 
the exercise of all of the outstanding options would dilute th e then existing stockholders percentage ownership of common stock  and any sale s in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such exercise coul d adversely affect prevailing market prices for the common stock 
moreover  th e terms upon which we would be able to obtain additional equity capital could b e adversely affected because the holders of such securities can be expected t o exercise or convert them at a time when we would  in all likelihood  be able t o obtain any needed capital on terms more favorable than those provided by suc h securities 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property  our business will suffer our success is dependent upon our proprietary technology 
currently the ipstor software suite is the core of our proprietary technology 
we hav e eighteen pending patent applications and multiple pending trademark application s related to our ipstor product 
we cannot predict whether we will receive patent s for our pending or future patent applications  and any patents that we own o r that are issued to us may be invalidated  circumvented or challenged 
i n addition  the laws of certain countries in which we sell and manufacture ou r products  including various countries in asia  may not protect our products an d intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the unite d states 
we also rely on trade secret  copyright and trademark laws  as wel l as the confidentiality and other restrictions contained in our respective sale s contracts and confidentiality agreements to protect our proprietary rights these legal protections afford only limited protection 
our technology may be subject to infringement claims that could harm ou r business 
we may become subject to litigation regarding infringement claim s alleged by third parties 
if an action is commenced against us  our managemen t may have to devote substantial attention and resources to defend that action 
a n unfavorable result for the company could have a material adverse effect on ou r business  financial condition and operating results and could limit our abilit y to use our intellectual property 
our efforts to protect our intellectual property may cause us to become involve d in costly and lengthy litigation  which could seriously harm our business 
in recent years  there has been significant litigation in the unite d states involving patents  trademarks and other intellectual property rights legal proceedings could subject us to significant liability for damages o r invalidate our intellectual property rights 
any litigation  regardless of it s outcome  would likely be time consuming and expensive to resolve and woul d divert management s time and attention 
any potential intellectual propert y litigation against us could force us to take specific actions  including o cease selling our products that use the challenged intellectua l property  o obtain from the owner of the infringed intellectual propert y right a license to sell or use the relevant technology o r trademark  which license may not be available on reasonabl e terms  or at all  or o redesign those products that use infringing intellectua l property or cease to use an infringing product or trademark 
the loss of any of our key personnel could harm our business 
our success depends upon the continued contributions of our ke y employees  many of whom would be extremely difficult to replace 
we do not hav e key person life insurance on any of our personnel 
worldwide competition fo r skilled employees in the network storage infrastructure software industry i s extremely intense 
if we are unable to retain existing employees or to hire an d integrate new employees  our business  financial condition and operating result s could suffer 
in addition  companies whose employees accept positions wit h competitors often claim that the competitors have engaged in unfair hirin g practices 
we may be the subject of such claims in the future as we seek to hir e qualified personnel and could incur substantial costs defending ourselve s against those claims 
we may not successfully integrate the products  technologies or businesses from or realize the intended benefits of acquisitions 
we have made  and may continue to make  acquisitions of othe r companies or their assets 
integration of the acquired products  technologie s and businesses  could divert management s time and resources 
further  we ma y not be able to properly integrate the acquired products  technologies o r businesses  with our existing products and operations  train  retain an d motivate personnel from the acquired businesses  or combine potentiall y different corporate cultures 
if we are unable to fully integrate the acquire d products  technologies or businesses  or train  retain and motivate personne l from the acquired businesses  we may not receive the intended benefits of th e acquisitions  which could harm our business  operating results and financia l condition 
long term character of investments 
our present and future equity investments may never appreciate i n value  and are subject to normal risks associated with equity investments i n businesses 
these investments may involve technology risks as well a s commercialization risks and market risks 
as a result  we may be required t o write down some or all of these investments in the future 
unknown factors additional risks and uncertainties of which we are unaware or whic h currently we deem immaterial also may become important factors that affect us 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risks 
our return on our investments in cash  cash equivalents an d marketable securities is subject to interest rate risks 
we regularly asses s these risks and have established policies and business practices to manage th e market risk of our marketable securities 
foreign currency risk 
we have several offices outside the united states accordingly  we are subject to exposure from adverse movements in foreig n currency exchange rates 
the effect of foreign currency exchange rat e fluctuations have not been material since our inception 
we do not us e derivative financial instruments to limit our foreign currency risk exposure
