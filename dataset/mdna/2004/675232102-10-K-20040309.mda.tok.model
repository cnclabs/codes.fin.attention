item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
all statements in this form k  other than statements of historical facts  including  without limitation  statements regarding our business strategy  plans for future operations and industry conditions  are forward looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of these forward looking statements are subject to various risks  uncertainties and assumptions  including those we refer to under the heading cautionary statement concerning forward looking statements in part i of this report 
although we believe that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are reasonable  because of the inherent limitations in the forecasting process  as well as the relatively volatile nature of the industries in which we operate  we can give no assurance that those expectations will prove to have been correct 
accordingly  evaluation of our future prospects must be made with caution when relying on forward looking information 
executive overview we generate approximately of our revenue from our services and products provided to the oil and gas industry 
in  we operated in what we consider to be a difficult market for oilfield services and products in general 
while a decrease of  the million net income we earned was the third highest in our history 
the decrease was attributable to our subsea products segment 
in  we expect this segment to increase its earnings 
we believe that growth in our subsea products segments will be driven by a rise in the use of subsea completions 
historically  there has been a strong correlation between the number of annual subsea tree orders and the follow on of orders for umbilicals 
the following table shows industry data and projections for worldwide subsea completions by decade 
number of period subsea completions s s s s s industry projection publicly available industry estimates project a increase in global subsea tree orders for we expect this to translate to a comparable increase in umbilical orders  with approximately of the market to be of the steel tube design 
the expansion of our us and brazil plants will quadruple our steel tube umbilical manufacturing capability and position us to better participate in this market shift to steel tube and the stronger market in general 
in  we completed or initiated the following acquisitions and major capital investments acquisition of ois international inspection plc acquisition of nauticos corporation acquisition of reflange  inc acquisition of rotator as equity investment in medusa spar llc acquisition of work class rovs from stolt offshore sa completed february expansion of our umbilical plants in the us and brazil acquisition of work class rovs from subsea subject to completion for  we expect relatively flat results from our segments other than subsea products and rovs 
we expect an increase in our rov results as a result of the acquisition of work class rovs from stolt offshore sa that we completed in february and the pending acquisition of work class rovs from the subsea group of companies  if completed 
the closing of the acquisition of the rovs from the subsea group is subject to several conditions  including no material adverse findings from our due diligence review  which we were conducting at the time of our filing of this report 
therefore  we cannot provide assurance that this transaction will be completed 

table of contents oceaneering international  inc 
subsidiaries we use our rovs in the offshore oil and gas industry to perform a variety of underwater tasks  including drill support  installation and construction support  pipeline inspection and surveys and subsea production facility operation and maintenance 
the largest percentage of our rovs are usually used to provide drill support services 
therefore  utilization of floating drilling rigs is a leading market indicator for this business 
the following table shows average floating rig use and our rov utilization 
average number of floating rigs in use rov utilization we also expect a profit contribution from our medusa spar llc investment  which will be reflected in our financial statements as equity earnings losses of unconsolidated affiliates 
critical accounting policies and estimates we have based the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations on our consolidated financial statements  which we have prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
these principles require us to make various estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods we present 
we base our estimates on historical experience  available information and other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  however  our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following discussion summarizes the accounting policies we believe require our management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments and are the most critical to our reporting of results of operations and financial position 
revenue recognition 
we recognize our revenues according to the type of contract involved 
on a daily basis  we recognize our billings under contracts that provide for specific time  material and equipment charges  which we bill periodically  ranging from weekly to monthly 
we account for significant lump sum contracts  which we enter into mainly in our subsea products and advanced technologies segments  and occasionally in our subsea projects segment  using the percentage of completion method 
under this method  we recognize estimated contract revenue based on costs incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated costs 
changes in the expected cost of materials and labor  productivity  scheduling and other factors affect the total estimated costs 
additionally  external factors  including weather or other factors outside of our control  may also affect the progress and estimated cost of a project s completion and  therefore  the timing of income and revenue recognition 
we routinely review estimates related to our contracts and reflect revisions to profitability in earnings immediately 
if a current estimate of total contract cost indicates an ultimate loss on a contract  we recognize the projected loss in full when we determine it 
in prior years  we have recorded adjustments to earnings as a result of revisions to contract estimates 
these include a loss on our first steel tube umbilical project in although we are continually striving to improve our ability to estimate our contract costs and profitability  adjustments to overall contract costs could be significant in future periods 
we recognize the remainder of our revenues as we deliver the goods and services and collection is reasonably assured 
long lived assets 
we evaluate our property and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be appropriate 
we base these evaluations on a comparison of the assets fair values  which are generally based on forecasts of cash flows associated with the assets  or fair market value of the assets  to the carrying amounts of the assets 
any impairment is recorded as the amount  if any  by which the carrying amounts exceed the fair values 
during the years ended december  and  we recorded million and million  respectively  in impairment charges related to property and equipment 
our expectations regarding future sales and undiscounted cash flows are highly subjective  cover extended periods of time and depend on a number of factors outside our control  such as changes in general economic conditions  laws and regulations 
accordingly  these expectations could differ significantly from year to year 
we expense the costs of repair and maintenance as we incur them  except for drydocking costs associated with our larger vessels 
we estimate and accrue these drydock costs over a period of time in advance of future drydockings 
we recognize differences between the estimates and actual costs incurred in the income statement 

table of contents oceaneering international  inc 
subsidiaries loss contingencies 
we self insure for workers compensation  maritime employer s liability and comprehensive general liability claims to levels we consider financially prudent and carry insurance for exposures beyond the self insurance levels  which can be by occurrence or in the aggregate 
we determine the level of accruals by reviewing our historical experience and current year claim activity 
we do not record accruals on a present value basis 
we review each claim with insurance adjusters and establish specific reserves for known liabilities 
we establish an additional reserve for incidents incurred but not reported to us for each year using our estimates and based on prior experience 
we believe we have established adequate accruals for uninsured expected liabilities arising from those obligations 
however  it is possible that future earnings could be affected by changes in our estimates relating to these matters 
we are involved in various claims and actions against us  most of which are covered by insurance 
we believe that our ultimate liability  if any  that may result from these claims and actions will not materially affect our financial position  cash flows or results of operations 
income taxes 
our tax provisions are based on our expected taxable income  statutory rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the interpretation of the related tax laws 
we are at risk that a taxing authority s final determination of our tax liabilities may differ from our interpretation 
our effective tax rate may fluctuate from year to year as our operations are conducted in different taxing jurisdictions  the amount of pre tax income fluctuates and our estimates regarding the realizability of items such as foreign tax credits may change 
currently payable income tax expense represents either nonresident withholding taxes or the liabilities expected to be reflected on our income tax returns for the current year  while the net deferred tax expense or benefit represents the change in the balance of deferred tax assets or liabilities as reported on our balance sheet 
we establish valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized in the future 
while we have considered estimated future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowances  changes in these estimates and assumptions  as well as changes in tax laws could require us to adjust the valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets 
these adjustments to the valuation allowance would impact our income tax provision in the period in which such adjustments are identified and recorded 
for a summary of our major accounting policies and a discussion of recently adopted accounting standards  please read note to our consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources we consider our liquidity and capital resources adequate to support our operations and internally generated growth initiatives 
at december   we had working capital of million  including cash of million 
additionally  we had million available under our revolving credit facility  which was scheduled to expire in july in january  we replaced our million revolving credit facility with an amended and restated million revolving credit facility  with similar terms and a final maturity in january  thereby increasing our available credit by million 
we believe this facility is more than sufficient to fund the pending acquisitions of rov equipment and the expansion of our umbilical capabilities described below 
at december   our debt to total capitalization ratio was 
we expect operating cash flow to meet our ongoing annual cash requirements  including debt service  for the foreseeable future 
net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our capital expenditures  including business acquisitions  for the years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively 
our capital expenditures during included the acquisitions of ois international inspection plc  nauticos corporation  reflange  inc and rotator as 
the acquisitions totaled million 
our other capital expenditures included additions to our fleet of rovs to replace older units we retired  the start of costs to upgrade our us and brazil umbilical plants  and vessel upgrades 
our capital expenditures during included rov additions and replacements  a replacement diving service vessel and additions related to the products and controls division of our subsea products segment 
our capital expenditures during included expenditures for additional rovs  completion of the ocean legend and upgrades and life extension of the ocean producer necessary for its new seven year contract  which began in the fourth quarter of 
table of contents oceaneering international  inc 
subsidiaries in the fourth quarter of  we announced two separate agreements  subject to due diligence and several closing conditions  to acquire a total of work class rovs  other equipment and related contracts and employees for a total of approximately million 
we completed one of these acquisitions  for work class rovs for approximately million  in february after this acquisition  we had increased our borrowings under our revolving credit agreement to million  and we had million remaining available committed credit under our revolving credit agreement 
as of december   we had announced plans to expand our us and brazil umbilical plant capabilities 
the us expansion includes a move to a new facility in panama city  florida  where we will add steel tube capability and have better deepwater access for the heavier loads involved with steel tube umbilicals 
we are also adding steel tube umbilical capability to our existing brazil facility 
we anticipate the total expenditures for the two expansions to be million  million of which we had incurred as of december  in april  we approved a plan to repurchase up to a maximum of million shares of our common stock  and we completed this plan in  at a total cost of million 
we reissued all of these shares through our incentive plans  as restricted stock  contributions to our k plan or for exercised stock options 
for a description of our incentive plans  please read note to our consolidated financial statements 
in september  we approved a plan to repurchase up to million additional shares  or million  of our common stock 
pursuant to this plan  we repurchased  shares of common stock through the year ended december   at a total cost of million 
through december   we had reissued  of these shares as contributions to our k plan or for exercised stock options 
we have not guaranteed any debt not reflected on our consolidated balance sheet and do not have any off balance sheet arrangements as defined by sec rules 
in december  we acquired a interest in medusa spar llc 
medusa spar llc has a bank loan of approximately of its total capitalization 
the bank loan is secured by minimum throughput guarantees by the other investors in medusa spar llc 
we expect the minimum throughput guarantees will generate sufficient revenue for medusa spar llc to repay the bank loan 
we are under no obligation to provide medusa spar llc or the banks with additional funds to repay the loan 
almost all of the cash flow generated by medusa spar llc will initially be used to repay the bank loan until the loan is retired 
after that  the cash flow from medusa spar llc will be available for distribution to the equity holders 
as a result  we do not expect to receive material cash distributions from medusa spar llc in the medusa spar llc is a variable interest entity under financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
fin no 

as we are not the primary beneficiary of medusa spar llc  we are accounting for our investment in medusa spar llc using the equity method of accounting 
our initial investment in medusa spar llc was million 
our principal source of cash from operating activities is our net income adjusted for the non cash expenses of depreciation and amortization and stock compensation under our restricted stock plan 
in  we had a large increase in our accounts receivable as we had large umbilical contracts in process at the end of as these were delivered and paid for in  our receivables declined and the payments were an additional source of funds 
we utilized million in in investing activities  in large part attributable to business acquisitions and our investment in medusa spar llc 
because of our significant foreign operations  we are exposed to currency fluctuations and exchange risks 
we generally minimize these risks primarily through matching  to the extent possible  revenues and expenses in the various currencies in which we operate 
cumulative translation adjustments as of december  relate primarily to our permanent investments in and loans to our foreign subsidiaries

these new vehicles are designed for use around the world in water depths to  feet and in severe weather 
table of contents oceaneering international  inc 
subsidiaries conditions 
we have added over of these rovs to our fleet during the last several years 
except for rovs acquired from competitors  at this time we do not plan to increase the size of our rov fleet  but will continue to build replacement units for ones we retire  as we determine necessary 
for  our rov revenue increased over from a higher percentage of construction support activities  which have higher dayrates than our drill support activities 
margins percentage remained flat as construction support also has higher operating expenses 
we expect the trend of a higher percentage of our rov revenue being derived from construction support to continue at least through for  our rov revenue was lower than the prior year 
gross margin declined and gross margin percentage declined 
these declines resulted from a decrease in fleet utilization of  from to  and an increase in repair and maintenance expenses 
we anticipate rov utilization and margins to increase in due to programs we have put in place to improve our rov marketing and operations  the acquisition of rovs from stolt offshore sa and  if completed  the acquisition of additional work class rovs from the subsea group of companies 
for  our subsea products revenues  margins and gross margin percentages were down due to lower activity at our uk and brazil umbilical plants 
in  subsea products gross margin was favorably impacted by million due to the successful completion and resolution of projects  including a related insurance claim  on a more favorable basis than we had previously anticipated 
in  margins were unfavorably impacted by our accrual of  of personnel severance costs to be incurred associated with the announced move of our us umbilical plant to panama city  florida 
we expect to incur approximately million more of moving expenses  in addition to the capital costs  in our subsea products revenue in was lower than in  while the gross margin and operating income percentages were up and  respectively 
in  we were producing our first large steel tube umbilical order at a loss 
when we completed the project in the first half of  the resulting available capacity allowed our uk plant to take on profitable work 
in  we completed manufacturing an order in excess of million in our brazilian plant 
this was the largest umbilical contract in our company s history 
we anticipate better results from our subsea products segment in  as our backlog at december  was higher than it was at december  and bidding activity for deepwater projects is at a higher level than it was in we expect higher volume of sales  principally to the west africa and gulf of mexico markets 
our mobile offshore production systems revenue and gross margins were lower in than in during the second quarter of  our customer exercised its option to extend the ocean legend contract for an additional two years at a reduced day rate 
as a result  our revenue and margin on this contract decreased by approximately  per day from mid may our mobile offshore production systems revenue was up for as compared to  primarily from a full year of service from the ocean legend  as compared to eight months in gross margin percentage and operating income percentage were both up 
in  we received and recognized million as revenue relating to a dispute with our customer 
in addition  the ocean producer began operation under a new seven year contract in the fourth quarter of  at higher revenues and margins than its prior contract 
we anticipate results similar to from our mobile offshore production systems operations in our subsea projects revenue  margins and margin percentages decreased in as compared to  and were closer to results attained in our results included a contribution from a significant engineering and specialized diving contract 
margins in were favorably impacted by reduction in cost estimates of million due to the favorable completion of an installation project and the settlement of personal injury claim 
in general  levels of deepwater activity in the gulf of mexico were lower than we had anticipated at the start of in  we expect our subsea projects segment to have results comparable to 
table of contents oceaneering international  inc 
subsidiaries the increases in our inspection revenues and margins from are a result of our acquisitions of gulf coast international inspection  inc in late and ois international inspection plc in early we expect that our margin percentages in our inspection segment will improve in as we continue to improve the efficiencies of the combined organizations 
advanced technologies 
the table below sets out revenue and profitability for this segment for the years ended december   and year ended december  dollars in thousands revenue gross margin gross margin operating income operating income our advanced technologies segment had higher revenues and gross margins for than as a result of increased work from the us navy  including a contribution from our acquisition of nauticos in april this segment s results were adversely affected by  as a result of settling a lawsuit against us for a higher amount than we had anticipated and previously accrued 
our advanced technologies revenue  gross margin and gross margin percentage for was about the same as for during an increase in marine services offset a decline in subsea telecommunication cable rov services and lower space related product sales 
operating income declined by million  or  due to a million charge to selling  general and administrative expenses for a doubtful account receivable related to work performed in prior years for an aerospace industry customer 
we anticipate advanced technologies revenues  gross margin and gross margin percentage to be similar to results 
unallocated expenses 
our unallocated expenses  ie  those not associated with a specific business segment  within gross margin consist of expenses related to our incentive and deferred compensation plans  including restricted stock and bonuses  as well as other general expenses 
our restricted stock expense varies with the market price of our common stock

interest expense decreased in as a result of lower average borrowings during the year 
interest expense declined in  as we generated sufficient cash flow to reduce our debt by million and increase our cash by million 
interest expense is net of capitalized interest of million for the year ended december  in and  equity in earnings losses of unconsolidated affiliates primarily related to our share of our commercial cable laying and maintenance venture 
due to the current condition of the telecommunications market  this venture is currently inactive and the single vessel used in the venture is being marketed for oilfield and other uses 
in  our losses in the cable laying venture were offset by income from an rov joint venture

our effective tax rate  including foreign  state and local taxes  was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we lowered our effective tax rate to in as we determined that we would be able to realize foreign tax credits and we were able to finalize tax positions related to the foreign vessel and diving operations that we sold in for  we anticipate an effective tax rate of approximately

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are currently exposed to certain market risks arising from transactions we have entered into in the normal course of business 
these risks relate to interest rate changes and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
we do not believe these risks are material 
we have not entered into any market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
we manage our exposure to interest rate changes through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in this report for a description of our long term debt agreements  interest rates and maturities 
we believe that significant interest rate changes will not have a material near term impact on our future earnings or cash flows 
because we operate in various oil and gas exploration and production regions in the world  we conduct a portion of our business in currencies other than the us dollar 
the functional currency for many of our international operations is the applicable local currency 
we manage our exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates primarily through arranging compensation in us dollars or freely convertible currency and  to the extent possible  by limiting compensation received in other currencies to amounts necessary to meet obligations denominated in those currencies 
we use the exchange rates in effect as of the balance sheet date to translate assets and liabilities as to which the functional currency is the local currency  resulting in translation adjustments that we reflect as accumulated other comprehensive income or loss in the shareholders equity section of our consolidated balance sheets 
we recorded adjustments of million and million to our equity accounts for the years ended december  and  respectively  to reflect the net impact of the strengthening of various foreign currencies against the us dollar for locations where the functional currency is not the us dollar 
our subsea products business in brazil conducts much of its operations in us dollars  which is its functional currency 
we recorded foreign currency losses of million and million in our income statements in and  respectively  related to our foreign operations  primarily in brazil 
a portion of our uk subsidiary s revenues are from uk dollar
