item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we begin management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a with a general discussion of our target markets  the nature of our products  and some of the business 
table of contents issues we are facing as a company 
this is followed by a discussion of the critical accounting policies and estimates that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results 
in the next section  we discuss our results of operations for the year ended march   or fiscal compared to fiscal and fiscal  and corresponding quarterly information within those quarters as viewed through the eyes of management 
we then provide an analysis of changes in our balance sheet and cash flows  and discuss our financial commitments in the section entitled liquidity and capital resources 
this md a should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this annual report on form k 
the various sections of this md a contain a number of statements of a forward looking nature relating to potential future events or to our future financial performance 
the forward looking statements are our targets based on current information and the industry s expectation of future market conditions 
they are not predictions of actual performance 
you should consider the various factors identified under the caption risk factors in evaluating those statements 
overview our markets we are focused on developing and marketing image processing solutions 
we design  develop and market integrated circuits that receive and process digital video and graphic images 
we also supply reference boards and designs that incorporate our software and proprietary integrated circuits  or chips 
our products are primarily used in displays which contain a large liquid crystal display  or lcd 
these displays may be used in desktop monitor applications or lcd televisions 
we generate the majority of our revenue by selling our image processing solutions to the manufacturers of lcd displays 
we outsource the manufacturing of our products to large semiconductor manufacturers  thereby eliminating the need for capital intensive plant and equipment 
our targeted long term gross profit percentage is in the range 
our most significant cash operating expense is labor  with our workforce employed in research and development of new products and technologies and in marketing  sales  customer support  and distribution of our products 
while we continue to service the increasing demand for flat panel computer monitors  we have sharpened our focus on the rapidly growing demand for flat panel televisions 
we also design products that serve both applications  or the so called multimedia display applications  and it is difficult to distinguish between a monitor with television capability and a television with a pc input 
both of these display devices could use the same genesis chip 
similarly  we supply certain customers with chips originally designed for a computer monitor that the customer may use as entry level flat panel television controllers 
we assist customers in developing their designs 
typically  a tv design will take more time and support from our field application engineers  increasing our costs during a customer s pre production period 
the growth in our target markets is finitely limited by the industry s capacity to supply lcd panels or other digital displays 
furthermore  the availability of lcd panels from time to time has been constrained  causing unexpected increases in the cost of lcd panels to our customers  thus resulting in our customers changing their demand expectations for our products 
our products usually represent less than five percent of the average retail cost of a standard lcd tv today  while the cost of the lcd panel within a flat panel computer monitor or lcd tv represents the majority of the cost of the finished product 
consequently  constraints on availability of lcd panels or increases in panel costs can result in reduced demand for our products  and it is very difficult to accurately predict the availability or cost of lcd panels and well beyond our means to control 
conversely  it is the increase in production volumes of larger size lcd panels in new fabrication facilities coming on line over the next two years that is expected to result in lower cost panels and hence lower average selling prices of the end product 
we expect this to lead to a significant increase in demand for display controllers 

table of contents our industry is very competitive and growth industries attract new entrants 
the flat panel computer monitor industry is highly competitive 
our average selling prices of monitor display controllers  in spite of increased functionality have declined by approximately over the past two years 
we expect the flat panel television industry will be as competitive over time 
our strategy is to maintain market leadership through integration of new features and functions and by providing the highest image quality at a cost effective price 
we believe we are able to deliver the desired feature rich image quality through relationships with customers  patented technologies  effective chip design  and customer support 
while maintaining our leadership in image quality and product feature sets  we strive to maximize profitability by reducing product cost through efficient chip design and driving costs down throughout our supply chain 
while we primarily market and sell our integrated circuits directly to manufacturers  we also sell finished systems  primarily to the high end display market  under the faroudja brand 
these products are generally sold through retail channels and represent a very small portion of our overall revenue 
average selling prices to distributors are typically less than average selling prices to direct customers for similar products 
sales to distributors comprise less than of revenue 
average selling prices and product margins of our products are typically highest during the initial months following product introduction and decline over time and as volume increases 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from product sales to manufacturers upon shipment  except when risks and rewards of ownership are not transferred upon shipment 
in these cases  revenue is not recognized until physical delivery to the customers premises 
for shipments to distributors  we recognize revenue upon the distributors shipment to their end customers  except in certain circumstances where orders are placed with non cancelable non return terms 
an example of this would be when last time orders are placed for products at the end of their life cycle 
in this situation  revenue would be recognized upon shipment 
reserves for sales returns and allowances are recorded at the time of shipment 
to date we have not experienced significant product returns 
manufacturing and supply we generally need to place purchase orders for products before we receive purchase orders from our customers 
this is because production lead times for silicon wafers  from which our products are manufactured  can be as long as two months  while many of our customers place orders only one month in advance of their requested delivery date 
we have agreements with suppliers in asia such that we are dependent on the suppliers manufacturing yields 
we continue to look at alternative sources of supply to reduce our reliance on key suppliers and reduce lead times  though dual sourcing for specific products is more costly in terms of set up and yields are typically lower as each manufacturing supplier ramps up production 
while we have frequent communication with significant customers to review their requirements  we are restricted in our ability to react to fluctuations in demand for our products and this exposes us to the risk of having either too much or not enough of a particular product 
we regularly evaluate the carrying value of inventory held 
for the year ended march   we recorded net reserves totaling  related to inventory where we did not foresee sufficient demand for the on hand inventory to support the carrying value 
global operations we operate through subsidiaries and offices in several countries throughout the world 
our head office is located in alviso silicon valley  california 
our research and development resources are located in the united states  canada and india 
the majority of our customers are located in asia  supported by our sales offices in china  japan  south korea and taiwan 
our third party suppliers are located primarily in taiwan 
although virtually all of our revenues and costs of revenues are denominated in us dollars  portions of our revenue and operating expenses are denominated in foreign currencies 
accordingly  our operating results are affected by 
table of contents changes in the exchange rate between the us dollar and those currencies 
any future strengthening of those currencies against the us dollar could negatively impact our operating results by increasing our operating expenses as measured in us dollars 
we do not currently engage in any hedging or other transactions intended to manage the risks relating to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  other than natural hedges that occur as a result of holding both assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
our operating expenses are also affected by changes in the rate of inflation in the various countries in which we operate 
mergers and acquisitions technology companies often use mergers or acquisitions to accelerate development of products  to realize potential synergies or to enter new markets 
we have made acquisitions in recent years  as described below 
on february   we acquired all of the outstanding shares of sage  inc sage in exchange for shares of our common stock 
sage  a public company  designed  developed and marketed digital display controllers and faroudja video processors 
in addition to bringing additional image processing and mixed signal technologies to address the flat panel monitor market  sage was developing significant expertise in technologies addressing other emerging display applications  including those technologies acquired during sage s acquisition of faroudja in june the sage operations are now fully integrated with genesis and the first products integrating both sage and genesis intellectual property are targeted for production with key customers later in calendar in connection with our acquisition of sage  we changed our legal domicile from nova scotia  canada  to delaware 
in march  we acquired substantially all the assets of vm labs  inc vm labs  including all patents  trademarks and other intellectual property 
certain former vm labs employees were retained to focus on incorporating the acquired technologies into existing and new genesis display products  and we are continuing to invest in the further development of the acquired technologies 
the primary focus for this group of employees is the area of consumer digital television 
we accounted for the acquisitions of sage and the assets of vm labs using the purchase method of accounting 
on march   we entered into an agreement and plan of merger with pixelworks  inc in august  genesis and pixelworks terminated the proposed merger 
under the termination agreement  each of the parties agreed to a mutual release of claims and pixelworks agreed to immediately pay genesis million as a reimbursement for our expenses 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
as described below  significant estimates are used in determining the allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory and deferred tax asset valuation  potential settlements and costs associated with patent litigation and the useful lives of intangible assets 
we evaluate our estimates on an on going basis  including those related to product returns  bad debts  inventories  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  warranty obligations and litigation and other contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

table of contents we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements we record estimated reductions to revenue for customer returns based on historical experience 
a customer may only return product if the product is faulty  although in certain circumstances we agree to accept returns if replacement orders are placed for other products 
if actual customer returns increase  we may be required to recognize additional reductions to revenue 
we record the estimated future cost of replacing faulty product as an increase to cost of sales 
to date we have not experienced significant returns related to quality 
if returns increase as a result of changes in product quality  we may be required to recognize additional warranty expense 
we maintain allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we have not suffered any significant loss in this area 
we provide for valuation reserves against our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those we project  additional inventory valuation reserves may be required 
we provide for costs associated with settling litigation when we believe that we have a reasonable basis for estimating those costs 
if actual costs associated with settling litigation differ from our estimates  we may be required to recognize additional costs 
goodwill  which represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations  is tested annually for impairment  and is tested for impairment more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the goodwill might be impaired 
the impairment tests are performed in accordance with fasb statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
accordingly  an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
this determination is made at the reporting unit level 
we have assigned all goodwill to a single  enterprise level reporting unit 
the impairment test consists of two steps 
first  we determine the fair value of the reporting unit 
the fair value is then compared to its carrying amount 
second  if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation in accordance with fasb statement no 
 business combinations 
the residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill 
we perform our annual impairment test on january st of each year 
we did not record any goodwill impairment charges in fiscal  or goodwill balances may also be affected by changes in other estimates made at the time of acquisitions 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
in making this determination we project taxable income by jurisdiction for the next five years based on market assumptions and company plans  and other jurisdictional history 
should we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
from time to time  we incur costs related to potential merger activities 
when we assess that we will be the acquirer for accounting purposes in such transactions and we expect to complete the transaction  direct costs associated with the acquisition are deferred and form part of the final purchase price 
in the event these assessments change  any such deferred costs would be expensed 
costs associated with other merger activities are expensed as incurred 

table of contents results of operations revenue and gross profit year ended march in thousands total revenue gross profit gross profit percentage revenue by geography united states china japan south korea taiwan rest of world total revenue total revenues revenues for the year ended march  increased by to million from million for the year ended march   which in turn represented an increase of from million for the year ended march  according to some industry reports  unit global demand for lcd monitors grew by approximately throughout calendar and by throughout calendar demand for advanced televisions started to increase in the second half of fiscal the growth in our revenues reflects the growth in unit demand for our products as we have successfully maintained a leadership position in these rapidly growing markets  though declining average selling prices because of competitive pressures and changes in product mix offset some of the growth in dollar terms 
our annual sequential unit shipments increased in fiscal to million units from million units in fiscal  while average selling prices on a blended basis declined by during the same period 
unit shipments increased in fiscal from million in fiscal  while average selling prices declined by 
the majority of our shipments continue to be to customers located in asia 
within this region  many of our taiwan customers have set up production facilities in china  and as a result our shipments to china have increased over the last three years 
certain companies in south korea such as samsung electronics and lg electronics continue to maintain significant market share  and while these companies are our leading customers  we have experienced a decline in volume at samsung due to competitive pressures 
we continue to maintain considerable market share in the advanced display market and expect to benefit from its continued growth 
while revenue continues to be dominated by shipments into flat panel monitor applications  we estimate that revenues from shipments into displays with video capability  such as lcd television  will continue to increase and become a larger proportion of total revenue to over of the total by the end of our next fiscal year 
we expect strong competition in all sectors of the market  but declines in average selling prices due to price competition at the low end of the display controller market are expected to slow down as prices approach cost for many manufacturers and we have less new entrants into the marketplace 
as for higher end display controllers with video capability  there remains considerable opportunity to improve quality and add features at reduced cost through further integration 
while continued revenue growth is one of our key goals  it is important to note that revenue is highly dependent on a number of factors  including  but not limited to  the growth rate of the flat panel monitor and advanced television markets  the rate of decline in product pricing  our ability to maintain design wins with customers  our ability to provide customer support resources  timely new product introductions  supply of products from our third party foundries and general economic and political conditions 
demand for our products 
table of contents may also be affected by the availability and price of lcd panels  or other components used in these display devices 
in particular  the supply of larger size lcd panels is expected to be constrained for the foreseeable future based on some industry reports 
gross profit gross profit for the year ended march  increased by to million from million for the year ended march   which in turn represented an increase of from million for the year ended march  as a percentage of revenues  gross profit represented of revenues for the year ended march   for the year ended march   and for the year ended march  this trend in gross profit percentage reflects the decline in our manufacturing costs at a faster rate than average selling prices in fiscal  a reversal of the trend from fiscal during fiscal  we improved our product design and successfully negotiated lower materials and processing cost from our key suppliers 
gross margins were also helped by a stronger mix of video products which have higher asp and gross margins 
going forward  we expect our mix of products to lead to a sustainable gross margin percentage in this range as shipments into higher margin television applications continue to grow at a faster rate than the lower end monitor applications 
however  we are currently in negotiation with one of our major manufacturing suppliers on pricing 
if we experience price increases from this supplier  this may put strain on our ability to maintain gross margins in the second half of fiscal while we are targeting longer term gross profit margins in the range  gross profit margins may be higher or lower than expected due to many factors including  but not limited to  competitive pricing actions  changes in estimated product costs or manufacturing yields  price changes from key suppliers  revenue levels  and changes in estimated product mix  many of which are outside of our control 
operating expenses management focuses on particular operating expenses in evaluating our financial condition and operating performance 
the following table presents these expenses in the form reviewed by management 
significant trends and fluctuations between periods are addressed in the narrative which follows 
in order to evaluate operating performance  management internally reports operating expenses in categories of a cash  non cash  and non recurring nature 
non cash expenses such as the amortization of intangible assets and the amortization of deferred stock based compensation are reviewed separately from other operating expenses 
also where past decisions have been made to reorganize our operations  certain comparative expenses are reviewed separately to allow for a more meaningful comparison of current and historical performance 
therefore  in the table below  operating costs related to the vm labs and restructuring costs are addressed separately so that other expenses are reviewed on a more consistent basis 
management finds this presentation to be a more effective method of assessing current operating performance 
year ended march of revenue of revenue of revenue research and development selling  general and administrative amortization of acquired intangibles amortization of deferred stock based compensation provision for costs associated with patent litigation vm labs operating and other restructuring costs in process research and development expense total operating expenses 
table of contents research and development research and development expenses include costs associated with research and development personnel  development tools  licensing costs  and prototyping 
research and development expenses for the fiscal year ended march  were million  compared with million in fiscal and million in fiscal the increase from fiscal to fiscal was in part due to additional headcount in connection with the acquisition of sage  inc in february  and employees of vm labs  inc in march it was also at this time that we began to invest more heavily in the research and development of technologies addressing the advanced television and video markets 
while there was only a modest increase of in overall spending between fiscal and fiscal  the mix of spending did change  with less effort directed at lower end monitor applications  and more focus on multimedia and video applications 
while we added resources performing research and development during fiscal  most of the additions were in lower cost geographic locations such as bangalore and toronto and thus we were able to increase resources and productivity at lower incremental cost 
we expect this trend to continue during fiscal these expenses represented of revenues in fiscal  in fiscal  and in fiscal selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses consist of personnel and related overhead costs for selling  including field application engineers  marketing  customer support  finance  human resources  legal and general management functions and of commissions paid to regional sales representatives 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended march  were million  compared with million in fiscal and million in fiscal much of the increase over the last two fiscal years reflects the investment in building both the brand value of our products and the infrastructure to support the expected growth in the advanced display market 
we market our dcdi by faroudja and other brands directly through trade shows and publications  and indirectly through partnerships with companies that use our products 
we believe that in building brand awareness  we will establish a reputation for quality and performance of our products in high end applications 
this may be one of the cornerstones of our success as the consumer electronics market grows and as these displays become more affordable to the end user 
we also provide quality technical support through field application engineers in china  japan  south korea and taiwan 
these engineers assist our customers in reaching mass production using our products 
we believe that this kind of investment at the early stages of a growing market positions us well to capitalize on the future unit growth that is forecasted for the advanced television market 
we expect these costs to continue to increase during fiscal as we assist customers in preparing for significant production volumes in fiscal and beyond 
these expenses represented of revenues in fiscal  in fiscal  and in fiscal amortization of acquired intangibles and in process research and development amortization of intangible assets acquired in connection with acquisitions of sage and the vm labs business was million for the year ended march  and the lower amortization in fiscal reflects the shorter amortization period  as the assets were acquired part way through the fourth quarter of fiscal in process research and development of million related to development at sage at the time of the acquisition that had not reached technical feasibility and had no other alternative use  was expensed upon the closing of the acquisition 
we anticipate the amortization of existing acquired intangibles to remain constant at million for fiscal  decline to million in fiscal  million for each of fiscal  and  and then zero thereafter  assuming no other acquisition activity 
amortization of deferred stock based compensation as part of the accounting for the acquisition of sage  the intrinsic value of unvested options issued in exchange for previously issued sage options  totaling approximately million  is being amortized to expense over the remaining term of the options  categorized in the statement of operations in accordance with the nature of the service provided by the related employees 
in assessing operating performance  management excludes these expenses from other research and development and selling  general and administrative costs 
however  in total  the amortization of deferred stock based compensation expense decreased 
table of contents from million to million in fiscal compared with fiscal this is as expected as related underlying options become fully vested and the deferred compensation fully amortized  or because certain options have been cancelled resulting from employees leaving the company 
in this situation  any unamortized deferred stock based compensation is adjusted through additional paid in capital 
the lower amortization in fiscal reflects the shorter amortization period  as the sage acquisition date was february  assuming there is no other acquisition activity  we anticipate the amortization of deferred stock based compensation to be approximately million for fiscal   in fiscal  then zero thereafter 
costs associated with patent litigation we have incurred significant costs associated with patent litigation over the past two fiscal years 
during the year ended march   we incurred legal costs of million associated with ongoing litigation to protect our intellectual property 
these costs were primarily payments made to third parties associated with this litigation 
in the year ended march   we recognized total costs of million  the majority of which was in connection with certain patent litigation brought against us by silicon image inc more details of the various litigation matters are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
vm labs and other restructuring costs after acquiring the assets of vm labs in march  we incurred restructuring costs and costs associated with discontinuing certain ongoing product development projects associated with vm labs at the time of the acquisition 
because these costs are considered non recurring  management excludes them from the other operating costs in reviewing the ongoing performance of the operations 
these costs  together with the operating costs of the vm labs operations until the decision was made to discontinue the projects  while still classified as operating costs and presented as such in the consolidated statements of operations  have been presented in the table above on a separate line from other research and development and selling  general and administrative costs 
total operating expenses total operating expenses for year ended march  were million compared with million in fiscal and million in fiscal in fiscal  higher selling  general and administrative costs were offset by lower amortization of deferred stock based compensation expenses and lower expenses resulting from discontinuing projects associated with the vm labs operation 
increases from fiscal reflect the higher selling  general and administrative costs  the amortization of intangibles related to the sage acquisition and costs associated with patent litigation 
non operating income and expenses gain on sale of investment during the third quarter of the year ended march   we sold of our minority investment in a private company for approximately million  realizing a gain of million 
the remaining investment with a carrying value of million is included in other long term assets 
provision for income taxes we recorded an income tax benefit of million for the year ended march  and million for the year ended march  we recorded a provision for income taxes in of million 
our accounting effective tax rate differs from the expected statutory rates due to several permanent differences including  but not limited to  federal and state research and experimentation tax credits  stock based compensation expense  foreign exchange fluctuations and differences in tax rates in foreign jurisdictions 
the net tax benefit of these items is partially offset by changes in the valuation allowance against net operating loss carryforwards in the united states 
therefore  the effective tax rate for accounting purposes is directly impacted by the mix of earnings between the united states and foreign jurisdictions 
a valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
as of march   we had generated deductible temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we have approximately million of operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income 
the carryforwards expire on various dates through  if not used 
utilization of a portion of net operating losses is subject to an annual limitation due to the ownership change provisions of the internal revenue code of and similar state provisions 

table of contents we have established a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets related to certain net operating loss carryforwards 
a valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
at march   the valuation allowance totaled million and we had million of net deferred tax assets on our balance sheet 
accordingly  we may record additional valuation allowances in the future 
the benefit of million of operating losses carryforwards  which relate to acquired entities or deductions associated with the exercise of certain stock options  if utilized  will result in an increase to equity or a reduction of goodwill 
the timing of when these operating losses arose will impact when they are utilized and hence have an impact on the effective tax rate in the future 
future income tax provisions will also depend on our effective tax rates and the distribution of taxable income and expenses between taxation jurisdictions  and the likelihood of being able to utilize available tax credits or losses 
quarterly results of operations the following table shows our unaudited quarterly statement of operations data for the most recent eight quarters reported 
this unaudited data has been prepared on the same basis as our audited consolidated financial statements that are included in item of this report  and includes all adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  necessary for a fair presentation of such information for the periods presented 
the statement of operations data should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and their related notes

table of contents most of our revenues come from sales of semiconductors to manufacturers of flat panel displays  including flat panel monitors 
in the june quarter  the price of lcd panels increased substantially which reduced demand for flat panel monitors and  in turn  for our products 
sales of semiconductor products to manufacturers of flat panel computer monitors are extremely price competitive 
while we experienced significant increases in our unit volumes in the period june to march  declines in average selling prices  or asps  partially offset revenue growth in that time period 
gross margins have varied from quarter to quarter depending on changes in product mix and the difference in rates of decline of asps compared to average product costs 
research and development expenses have varied from quarter to quarter primarily due to fluctuations in staff levels and the timing of non recurring engineering charges related to new product development 
in addition  since the march quarter  these expenses have increased as a result of greater staff levels  resulting from our acquisition of sage and the hiring of former employees of vm labs 
selling  general and administrative expenses have varied from quarter to quarter primarily due to increases in staffing levels for sales and customer support activities  and sales commissions 
costs associated with patent litigation have varied from quarter to quarter depending on the level of activity related to specific legal proceedings and the timing of provision for potential settlements 
more details of the legal proceedings are described in item of this report 
our results of operations have fluctuated significantly in the past and may continue to fluctuate in the future as a result of a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include those described under the caption risk factors  among others 
any one or more of these factors could result in our failure to achieve our expectations as to future operating results 
our expenditures for research and development  selling  general and administrative functions are based in part on future revenue projections 
we may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner in response to any unanticipated declines in revenues  which may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may be required to reduce our selling prices in response to competitive pressure or other factors  or to increase spending to pursue new market opportunities or to defend ourselves against lawsuits that may be brought against us 
any decline in average selling prices of a particular product that is not offset by a reduction in product costs  or by sales of other products with higher gross margins  would decrease our overall gross profit and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
liquidity and capital resources since inception we have satisfied our liquidity needs primarily through cash generated from operations and sales of equity securities  initially by way of a public offering  and subsequently under our stock option and employee stock purchase plans 
we believe that our existing cash balances together with any cash generated from our operations will be sufficient to meet our capital and operating requirements for the foreseeable future 
periodically  we may be required to use a portion of our cash balances to increase investment in operating assets such as accounts receivable or inventory to assist in the growth of our business  or for capital assets such as land  buildings or equipment 
furthermore  because we do not have our own semiconductor manufacturing facility  we may be required to make deposits to secure supply in the event there is a shortage of manufacturing capacity in the future 
while we currently have no plans to raise additional funds for such uses  we could be required or could elect to seek to raise additional capital in the future 
from time to time we evaluate acquisitions of businesses  products or technologies that are complementary or strategic to our business 
any such transactions  if consummated  may use a portion of our working capital or require the issuance of equity securities that may result in further dilution to our existing stockholders 
mar mar cash and short term investments working capital current ratio receivables days outstanding inventory days 
table of contents we believe that our financial condition remains strong 
at march   cash and short term investments totaled million up from million at march  and million at march  our current ratio increased to at march  from at march  prior to changes in working capital balances  we generated million of cash from operations during fiscal  compared with million in fiscal and million during fiscal we have no debt and we expect to continue to generate cash from operations during fiscal after changes in working capital balances  net cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended march  compared with cash generated from operating activities of million for fiscal and million for fiscal working capital uses of cash included increases in accounts receivable and inventory  and a decrease in accrued liabilities 
accounts receivable increased by million from march  to march  the day s sales outstanding also increased from days at march  to days at march  this increase reflects the timing of shipments during the period and the impact of extending payment terms to certain key customers  a trend which is expected to continue as we compete with the terms offered by our competition and as our key customers feel pressure from their own customers to provide more favorable payment terms 
also  as our customers become more established in china  we are becoming more comfortable with extending credit 
our credit policy is to offer credit to customers only after careful examination of their creditworthiness 
our payment terms range from cash in advance of shipment  to payment sixty days after shipment 
for fiscal  our three largest customers accounted for approximately of revenue  compared with in fiscal and in fiscal additionally  the top three customers accounted for of accounts receivable at march  and at march  inventory levels increased by during fiscal this increase reflects the short supply of inventory on hand at march  and the timing of receipt of inventory during the fourth quarter of fiscal average days of inventory during the year ended march  were days compared to days for the year ended march  the average inventory levels and the impact on inventory turns is the result of a number of dynamic activities including the accuracy of customer s forecasts  expected panel supplies  and pricing considerations and is not necessarily an indication of what inventory turns might be in the future 
accrued liabilities decreased by million to million at march   from million at march  primarily due to the payments made related to the silicon image judgment as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
net cash used in investing activities was million during the year ended march  this included the net purchases of short term investments of million and capital spending of million  offset in part by the reimbursement of previously deferred costs associated with the terminated pixelworks merger 
this compared to million used in investing activities in the year ended march   and million provided by investing activities in fiscal fiscal was the year we acquired sage  including million of cash and short term investments  and vm labs assets for million 
net cash provided by financing activities in year ended march  was million 
this represented funds received for the purchase of shares under the terms of our stock option plans and employee stock purchase plan 
in fiscal  we used million in net cash for financing activities  including million to repurchase common stock  and million to settle an outstanding lease liability  as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in fiscal we received million in proceeds received on exercise of stock options pursuant to our employee stock option and employee stock purchase programs 
contractual obligations as of march   our principal commitments consisted of obligations outstanding under operating leases 
these commitments include leases for two premises in the united states  located in san jose and alviso  california  two in china and one location in each of canada  india  japan  south korea and taiwan 
in addition we have obligations under operating leases for equipment 
the aggregate minimum annual payments required under our lease obligations  excluding expected sub lease income  by fiscal year are as follows  in thousands of dollars payments due by fiscal year total and and and beyond operating leases our lease agreements expire at various dates through calendar 
table of contents purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of raw material and other goods and services have not been separately disclosed 
we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations  as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
our purchase orders for manufacturing are based on our current needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons 
we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements for three months 
we also enter into contracts for outsourced services  however  the obligations under these contracts are not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty 
further information on lease obligations and commitments can be found in note to our consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition  revenue or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
capital commitments we do not have any capital commitments that will have a material future effect on our financial condition 
risk factors a number of our statements in this report  including those concerning our anticipated revenues  gross profit margins  amortization of intangibles and stock based compensation  liquidity and business strategy  are forward looking and subject to various risks and uncertainties 
the following factors may have a harmful impact on our business our quarterly revenues and operating results fluctuate due to a variety of factors  which may result in volatility or a decline in our stock price 
our historical revenues and operating results have varied significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors  including fluctuation in demand for our products  fluctuations in supply or demand for other components included in flat panel displays  changes in the mix of products sold  timing of new product introductions by us or our competitors  degree of market acceptance of our products and the displays into which our products are incorporated  increased competition and competitive pricing pressures  changes in product costs or manufacturing yields or available production capacity at the fabrication facilities  seasonality in demand for our products or our customers displays  costs and outcome of legal proceedings  and the evolving and unpredictable nature of the markets for our customers display products that incorporate our products 
as a result of the fluctuation in our revenues and operating results  our stock price can be volatile  especially if our actual financial performance in a quarter deviates from the financial targets we set at the beginning of that quarter  or from market expectations 

table of contents our success will depend on the growth of the market for flat panel televisions and lcd monitors our ability to generate revenues will depend on the growth of the market for liquid crystal display  or lcd  televisions  flat panel computer monitors  and digital televisions 
our continued growth will also depend upon emerging markets for consumer electronics markets such as hdtv and home theater 
the potential size of these markets and the timing of their development are uncertain and will depend in particular upon a significant reduction in the costs of products in the respective markets  the availability  at a reasonable price  of components required by such products such as lcd panels  and the emergence of competing technologies 
these and other potential markets may not develop as expected  which would harm our business 
we have had significant management turnover  and may not be able to retain or attract the key personnel we need to succeed we have had significant turnover in our management team  including the position of chief executive officer 
our current chief executive is an interim chief executive officer and we are in the process of an executive search for this position 
in addition  we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract and retain other key employees  including senior management and executive positions 
if we cannot attract and retain these key employees  our business would be harmed  particularly if the departure of any key employee results in a business interruption or if we are not successful in preserving material knowledge of our departing employees 
a large percentage of our revenues come from sales to a small number of customers the markets for our products are highly concentrated 
our sales are derived from a limited number of customers 
sales to our largest five customers accounted for of our revenues  and for our largest customer  for the fiscal year ended march  we expect that a small number of customers will continue to account for a large amount of our revenues 
all of our sales are made on the basis of purchase orders rather than long term agreements so that any customer could cease purchasing products at any time without penalty 
the decision by any large customer to decrease or cease using our products could harm our business 
if we are unable to introduce new products with higher average selling prices  our financial results may suffer average selling prices for our flat panel monitor products have declined 
when average selling prices decline  our revenues decline unless we are able to sell more units  and our gross margins decline unless we are able to reduce our manufacturing and or other supply chain costs by a commensurate amount or introduce new higher priced products to offset the declining price of existing products 
our operating results suffer when gross margins decline 
we must introduce new products with higher average selling prices in order to counteract the decline in prices for our existing product line 
the sales of our products are highly concentrated and our products may not continue to be accepted in the advanced display industry our sales are derived from a limited number of products 
two of our products accounted for of our revenues for the fiscal year ended march  there were no other products accounting for more than ten percent of our revenues 
we expect that a small number of products will continue to account for a large amount of our revenues 

table of contents our success in the advanced display market  which includes flat panel computer monitors  as well as lcd and digital televisions  home theater  dvd  and hdtv will depend upon the extent to which manufacturers of those products incorporate our integrated circuits into their products 
our ability to sell products into this market will depend upon demand for the functionality provided by our products and their pricing 
we typically need to determine the functionality of our products and to complete their design in advance of our customers completing the designs of their products 
as a result  we may not be able to react to changes in our customers desired functionality in a timely manner 
we must develop new products and enhance our existing products to react to rapid technological change we must develop new products and enhance our existing products with improved technologies to meet rapidly evolving customer requirements and industry standards 
we need to design products for customers that continually require higher functionality at lower costs 
this requires us to continue to add features to our products and to include all of these features on a single chip 
the development process for these advancements is lengthy and will require us to accurately anticipate technological innovations and market trends 
developing and enhancing these products is time consuming  costly and complex 
there is a risk that these developments and enhancements will be late  fail to meet customer or market specifications  and will not be competitive with other products using alternative technologies that offer comparable functionality 
we may be unable to successfully develop new products or product enhancements 
any new products or product enhancements may not be accepted in new or existing markets 
if we fail to develop and introduce new products or product enhancements  that failure will harm our business 
we face intense competition and may not be able to compete effectively the market in which we operate is intensely competitive and is characterized by technological change  evolving industry standards and rapidly declining average selling prices 
we compete with both large companies and start up companies  including ati technologies  micronas semiconductor holding ag  media reality technologies  inc  mstar semiconductor  inc  novatek microelectronics  oplus technologies  ltd  philips semiconductors  a division of philips electronics nv  pixelworks  inc  realtek semiconductor corp  silicon image  inc  st microelectronics  inc  trident microsystems  inc  trumpion microelectronics  inc 
and zoran corporation 
in addition  many of our current and potential customers have their own internally developed integrated circuit solutions  and may choose not to purchase solutions from third party suppliers like genesis 
as the market for our products continues to develop  our current customers may increase reliance on their own internally developed solutions  and competition from diversified electronic and semiconductor companies will intensify 
some competitors  which may include our own customers  are likely to include companies with greater financial and other resources than us 
increased competition could harm our business  by  for example  increasing pressure on our profit margins or causing us to lose customers 
also  the federal district court for the eastern district of virginia has issued an amended final judgment which states that we have received a license from silicon image  inc for certain of their dvi and hdmi patents  and must pay silicon image royalties on all of our dvi and hdmi products 
this amended final judgment  if not overturned on appeal  could hinder our ability to compete with unlicensed competitors that are not required to pay royalties on competing products 
our future operating results are highly dependent upon how well we manage our business our future operating results will depend in large part on how well we manage our business  including our ability to develop profitable products and meet milestones by accurately forecasting revenues and costs and allocating resources effectively  develop strategies to protect our brands and to realize their potential value  manage our inventory levels by accurately predicting sales volumes  
table of contents maximize our gross margins by negotiating favorable yet competitive prices with customers  and by leveraging volume to reduce costs with our suppliers  develop effective selling tools  and monitor and manage expenses 
any failure by us to effectively manage our business could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  as well as non disclosure agreements and other methods to protect our proprietary technologies we have been issued patents and have pending united states and foreign patent applications 
however  we cannot assure you that any patent will be issued as a result of any applications or  if issued  that any claims allowed will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology 
it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products  or technology without authorization  develop similar technology independently or design around our patents 
effective copyright  trademark and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in foreign countries 
in addition  it is possible that existing or future patents may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
in particular  we have brought patent infringement suits against third parties 
an unfavorable outcome in these suits could result in invalidation of the patents we assert in these suits 
patent litigation we bring against others may damage customer relationships we may need to enforce our intellectual property rights against customers  which could make it impossible to enforce those rights without damaging our relationship or cause us to lose business in other areas 
intellectual property infringement suits brought against us may significantly harm our business we have been defending claims brought against us by silicon image  inc  alleging that certain of our products that contain digital receivers infringe various silicon image patent claims 
on december   the court issued its amended final judgment in the proceeding  which such judgment is being appealed  see part i  item  legal proceedings 
this lawsuit or any future lawsuits could subject us to permanent injunctions preventing us from selling selected products or incurring significant monetary damages 
based on our revenue for the year ended march   approximately of our revenues could be impacted by this patent litigation 
we may become subject to additional intellectual property litigation in the future 
in addition  intellectual property lawsuits  regardless of their success  would likely be time consuming and expensive to resolve and would divert management time and attention 
intellectual property litigation also could force us to do one or more of the following stop selling products or using technology that contain the allegedly infringing intellectual property  attempt to obtain a license to the relevant intellectual property  which license may not be available on reasonable terms or at all  incur substantial settlement costs  and attempt to redesign those products that contain the allegedly infringing intellectual property 
if we are forced to take any of these actions  we may be unable to manufacture and sell some of our products  which could harm our business 
we may lose our customers or be required to make payments to them in connection with patent infringement litigation our customers typically buy our components and integrate them into their products for resale 
as a result of patent infringement litigation  our customers may decide to stop buying from us to ensure that their products do 
table of contents not include infringing components  even if the patent litigation is ultimately decided in our favor 
any such action could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and market share 
in addition  from time to time  we enter into agreements with our customers that may contain indemnification provisions in connection with sales of our components that are the subject of patent litigation 
if one of our customers incurs a loss because of a patent infringement suit brought against them or us  we may be required  under those agreements or otherwise  to reimburse those customers for their loss 
any such indemnification obligations could result in significant payments by us that would have a material adverse effect on our financial position 
we may become subject to judgments for securities class action suits we are a defendant in a securities class action suit 
we believe that we have meritorious defenses to the claims in the securities class action suit as well as adequate insurance coverage to cover any likely unfavorable outcome 
however  this or any future securities class action suit could subject us to judgments in excess of our insurance coverage and could harm our business 
in addition  this kind of lawsuit  regardless of its outcome  is likely to be time consuming and expensive to resolve and may divert management time and resources 
the processes used to manufacture our semiconductor products are periodically retired as semiconductor manufacturing technologies advance  manufacturers typically retire their older manufacturing processes in favor of newer processes 
when this occurs  the manufacturer generally provides notice to its customers of its intent to discontinue a process  and its customers will either retire the affected part or design a newer version of the part that can be manufactured on the more advanced process 
consequently  our products may become unavailable from their current manufacturers if the processes on which they are produced are discontinued 
our devices are mainly and micron technology and these geometries will likely be available for the next two to three years 
we must manage the transition to new parts from existing parts 
we have commitments from our suppliers to provide notice of any discontinuance of their manufacturing processes in order to assist us in managing these types of product transitions 
our semiconductor products are complex and are difficult to manufacture cost effectively the manufacture of semiconductors is a complex process 
it is often difficult for semiconductor foundries to achieve acceptable product yields 
product yields depend on both our product design and the manufacturing process technology unique to the semiconductor foundry 
since low yields may result from either design or process difficulties  identifying yield problems can only occur well into the production cycle  when a product exists which can be physically analyzed and tested 
defects in our products  including related software  could increase our costs  cause customer claims  and delay our product shipments although we test our products  including related software  they are complex and may contain defects and errors 
in the past we have encountered defects and errors in our products 
delivery of products with defects or reliability  quality or compatibility problems may damage our reputation and our ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers 
in addition  product defects and errors or software bugs could result in additional development costs  diversion of technical resources  delayed product shipments  increased product returns  and product liability claims against us which may not be fully covered by insurance 
any of these could harm our business 
we subcontract our manufacturing  assembly and test operations we do not have our own fabrication facilities  assembly or testing operations 
instead  we rely on others to fabricate  assemble and test all of our products 
most of our products use silicon wafers manufactured by taiwan semiconductor manufacturing corporation  with whom we have a fixed term sole source arrangement  the loss of which could result in a material increase in the price we must pay for silicon wafers 
none of our products are fabricated by more than one supplier 
there are many risks associated with our dependence upon outside manufacturing  including reduced control over manufacturing and delivery schedules of products  
table of contents potential political or environmental risks in the countries where the manufacturing facilities are located  reduced control over quality assurance  increased manufacturing cost to us in the event that manufacturing capacity becomes constrained  difficulty of management of manufacturing costs and quantities  potential lack of adequate capacity during periods of excess demand  and potential misappropriation of intellectual property 
we depend upon outside manufacturers to fabricate silicon wafers on which our integrated circuits are imprinted 
these wafers must be of acceptable quality and in sufficient quantity and the manufacturers must deliver them to assembly and testing subcontractors on time for packaging into final products 
we have at times experienced delivery delays and long manufacturing lead times 
these manufacturers fabricate  test and assemble products for other companies 
we cannot be sure that our manufacturers will devote adequate resources to the production of our products or deliver sufficient quantities of finished products to us on time or at an acceptable cost 
the lead time necessary to establish a strategic relationship with a new manufacturing partner is considerable 
we would be unable to readily obtain an alternative source of supply for any of our products if this proves necessary 
any occurrence of these manufacturing difficulties could harm our business or cause us to incur costs to obtain adequate and timely supply of products 
our third party wafer foundries  third party assembly and test subcontractors and significant customers are located in an area susceptible to earthquakes most of our outside foundries  third party assembly and test subcontractors are located in taiwan  which is an area susceptible to earthquakes 
in addition  some of our significant customers are located in taiwan 
damage caused by earthquakes in taiwan may result in shortages of water or electricity or cause transportation difficulties that could limit the production capacity of our outside foundries or the ability of our subcontractors to provide assembly and test services 
any reduction in production capacity or the ability to provide assembly and test services could cause delays or shortages in our product supply  which would harm our business 
foundries located in taiwan were responsible for most of our semiconductor product revenue for the fiscal year ended march  customers located in taiwan were of our revenue for the fiscal year ended march  if future earthquakes damage our customers facilities or equipment they could reduce their purchases of our products  which would harm our business 
in addition  the operations of suppliers to our outside foundries and our taiwanese customers could be disrupted by future earthquakes  which could in turn harm our business by resulting in shortages in our product supply or reduced purchases of our products 
we do not have long term commitments from our customers  and we allocate resources based on our estimates of customer demand our sales are made on the basis of purchase orders rather than long term purchase commitments 
in addition  our customers may cancel or defer purchase orders 
we manufacture our products according to our estimates of customer demand 
this process requires us to make multiple demand forecast assumptions  each of which may introduce error into our estimates 
if we overestimate customer demand  we may manufacture products that we may not be able to sell 
as a result  we would have excess inventory  which would increase our losses 
conversely  if we underestimate customer demand or if sufficient manufacturing capacity were unavailable  we would forego revenue opportunities  lose market share and damage our customer relationships 
our lengthy sales cycle can result in uncertainty and delays in generating revenues because our products are based on new technology and standards  a lengthy sales process  typically requiring several months or more  is often required before potential customers begin the technical evaluation of our products 
this technical evaluation can then exceed six months 
it can take an additional six months before a customer commences volume shipments of systems that incorporate our products 
this cycle may be even longer 
table of contents as we enter the television market 
however  even when a manufacturer decides to design our products into its systems  the manufacturer may never ship systems incorporating our products 
given our lengthy sales cycle  we experience a delay between the time we increase expenditures for research and development  sales and marketing efforts and inventory and the time we generate revenues  if any  from these expenditures 
as a result  our business could be harmed if a significant customer reduces or delays its orders or chooses not to release products incorporating our products 
our business depends on relationships with industry leaders that are non binding we work closely with industry leaders in the markets we serve to design products with improved performance  cost and functionality 
we typically commit significant research and development resources to such design activities 
we often divert financial and personnel resources from other development projects without entering into agreements obligating these industry leaders to continue the collaborative design project or to purchase the resulting products 
the failure of an industry leader to complete development of a collaborative design project or to purchase the products resulting from such projects would have an immediate and serious impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our inability to establish such relationships in the future would  similarly  harm our business 
a large percentage of our revenues will come from sales outside of the united states  which creates additional business risks a large portion of our revenues will come from sales to customers outside of the united states  particularly to equipment manufacturers located in south korea  china  japan and taiwan 
for the fiscal year ended march   sales to regions outside of the united states represented of revenues 
for that same period  sales to china and south korea alone constituted and  respectively  of revenues 
these sales are subject to numerous risks  including fluctuations in currency exchange rates  tariffs  import restrictions and other trade barriers  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  political and economic instability  exposure to litigation or government investigations in these countries  longer payment periods  ability to enforce contracts or payment terms  potentially adverse tax consequences  export license requirements  and unexpected changes in diplomatic and trade relationships 
because our sales are denominated in united states dollars  increases in the value of the united states dollar could increase the price of our products in non us markets and make our products more expensive than competitors products denominated in local currencies 
we are subject to risks associated with international operations  which may harm our business we depend on product design groups located outside of the united states  primarily in canada and in india 
we also rely on foreign third party manufacturing  assembly and testing operations 
these foreign operations subject us to a number of risks associated with conducting business outside of the united states  including the following unexpected changes in  or impositions of  legislative or regulatory requirements  delays resulting from difficulty in obtaining export licenses for certain technology  tariffs  quotas and other trade barriers and restrictions  
table of contents imposition of additional taxes and penalties  the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws  and other factors beyond our control  including acts of terrorism  which may delay the shipment of our products  impair our ability to travel or our ability to communicate with foreign locations 
in addition  the laws of certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be designed  manufactured or sold may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
this increases the possibility of piracy of our technology and products 
the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry may lead to significant variances in the demand for our products 
in the past  significant downturns and wide fluctuations in supply and demand have characterized the semiconductor industry 
also  the industry has experienced significant fluctuations in anticipation of changes in general economic conditions  including economic conditions in asia 
these cycles have led to significant variances in product demand and production capacity 
they have also accelerated the erosion of average selling prices per unit 
we may experience periodic fluctuations in our future financial results because of changes in industry wide conditions 
our customers experience fluctuating product cycles and seasonality  which causes their sales to fluctuate our products are incorporated into flat panel displays 
because the market for flat panel displays is characterized by numerous new product introductions  our operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
our customers also experience seasonality in the sales of their products  which affects their orders of our products 
typically  the second half of the calendar year represents a disproportionate percentage of sales for our customers due to the holiday shopping period for these products  and therefore  a disproportionate percentage of our sales 
also  our sales in the first quarter of the calendar year may be lower as a result of the chinese new year holiday in asia 
we expect these sales fluctuations to continue for the foreseeable future 
we have grown rapidly  which strains our management and resources we have experienced significant growth  which places a great strain on our management and other resources 
to manage our growth effectively  we must implement and improve operational and financial systems  train and manage our employee base  including our sales force  and attract and retain qualified personnel with relevant experience 
we must also manage multiple relationships with customers  business partners  and other third parties  such as our foundry and test partners 
moreover  we will spend substantial amounts of time and money in connection with our rapid growth and may have unexpected costs 
our systems  procedures or controls may not be adequate to support our operations and we may not be able to expand quickly enough to exploit potential market opportunities 
our future operating results will also depend on expanding sales and marketing  research and development and administrative support 
if we cannot attract qualified people or manage growth effectively  our business would be seriously harmed 
a breakdown in our information technology systems could cause a business interruption  impair our ability to manage our business or report results  or result in the unauthorized disclosure of our confidential and proprietary information our information technology systems could suffer a sudden breakdown as a result of factors beyond our control  such as earthquakes  insecure connections or problems with our outside consultants who provide 
table of contents information technology services to us 
if our information technology systems were to fail and we were not able to gain timely access to adequate alternative systems or back up information  this could have a negative impact on our ability to operate and manage our business and to report results in a timely manner 
also  any breach of our information systems by an unauthorized third party could result in our confidential information being made public or being used by a competitor  which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to realize the potential of our proprietary rights 
we may make acquisitions where advisable  and acquisitions involve numerous risks our growth is dependent upon market growth and our ability to enhance our existing products and introduce new products on a timely basis 
one of the ways we may address the need to develop new products is through acquisitions of other companies or technologies  such as our acquisitions of sage and the assets of vm labs 
the recent acquisitions and potential future acquisitions involve numerous risks  including the following we may experience difficulty in assimilating the acquired operations and employees  we may be unable to retain the key employees of the acquired operations  the acquisitions may disrupt our ongoing business  we may not be able to incorporate successfully the acquired technologies and operations into our business and maintain uniform standards  controls  policies and procedures  and we may lack the experience to enter into new markets  products or technologies 
acquisitions of high technology companies are inherently risky  and no assurance can be given that our recent or potential future acquisitions will be successful and will not adversely affect our business  operating results or financial condition 
we must also maintain our ability to manage growth effectively 
failure to manage growth effectively and successfully integrate acquisitions made by us could materially harm our business and operating results 
general economic conditions may reduce our revenues and harm our business as our business has grown  we have become increasingly subject to the risks arising from adverse changes in domestic and global economic conditions 
because of the recent economic slowdown  many industries are delaying or reducing technology purchases 
as a result  if economic conditions in the united states  asia or europe worsen  or if a wider or global economic slowdown occurs  reduced orders and shipments may cause us to fall short of our revenue expectations for any given period and may result in us carrying increased inventory 
these conditions would negatively affect our business and results of operations 
if our inventory builds up as a result of order postponement  we would carry excess inventory that is either unusable or that must be sold at reduced prices which will harm our revenues 
in addition  weakness in the technology market could negatively affect the cash flow of our customers who could  in turn  delay paying their obligations to us 
this would increase our credit risk exposure  which could harm our financial condition 
terrorist acts and acts of war may seriously harm our business  revenues  costs  expenses and financial condition terrorist acts or acts of war  wherever located around the world  may cause damage or disruption to us  our employees  facilities  partners  suppliers  distributors  resellers and customers  which could significantly impact our revenues  expenses and financial condition 
the terrorist attacks that took place in the united states on september  were unprecedented events that have created many economic and political uncertainties  some of which may materially harm our business and results of operations 
the long term effects on our business of the september  attacks are unknown 
the potential for future terrorist attacks  the national and international responses to terrorist attacks  hostilities in the middle east  including iraq  and other acts of war or hostility  especially in the korean peninsula  have created economic and political uncertainties  which could 
table of contents adversely affect our business and results of operations in ways that cannot be predicted 
in addition  as a company with headquarters and significant operations located in the united states  we may be impacted by actions against the united states 
we are uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts and acts of war 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the fair value of our investment portfolio or related income would not be significantly impacted by either a increase or decrease in interest rates due mainly to the short term nature of the major portion of our investment portfolio 
we carry out a significant portion of our operations outside of the united states  primarily in canada and in india and to a lesser extent china  japan  south korea and taiwan 
although virtually all of our revenues and costs of revenues are denominated in us dollars  portions of our revenue and operating expenses are denominated in foreign currencies 
accordingly  our operating results are affected by changes in the exchange rate between the us dollar and those currencies 
any future strengthening of those currencies against the us dollar could negatively impact our operating results by increasing our operating expenses as measured in us dollars 
we do not currently engage in any hedging or other transactions intended to manage the risks relating to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  other than natural hedges that occur as a result of holding both assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
we may in the future undertake hedging or other such transactions if we determine that it is necessary to offset exchange rate risks 
based on our overall currency rate exposure at march   a near term appreciation or depreciation in the us dollar relative to a pool of our foreign currencies would not have a material effect on our operating results or financial condition
