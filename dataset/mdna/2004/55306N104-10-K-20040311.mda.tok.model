item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading worldwide provider of instruments  components  subsystems and process control solutions that measure  control  power and monitor critical parameters of semiconductor and other advanced manufacturing processes 
we are organized into three product groups instruments and control systems  power and reactive gas products and vacuum products 
our products are derived from our core competencies in pressure measurement and control  materials delivery  gas and thin film composition analysis  control and information management  power and reactive gas generation and vacuum technology 
our products are used to manufacture semiconductors  thin film coatings for diverse markets such as flat panel displays  optical and magnetic storage media  architectural glass and electro optical products 
we also provide technologies for medical imaging equipment 
we have a diverse base of customers that include manufacturers of semiconductor capital equipment  semiconductor devices  data storage equipment  medical equipment and flat panel displays  as well as industrial manufacturing companies  and university  government and industrial research laboratories 
during the years ended december   and  we estimate that approximately  and of our net sales  respectively  were to semiconductor capital equipment manufacturers and semiconductor device manufacturers 
we expect that sales to such customers will continue to account for a substantial majority of our sales 
the semiconductor capital equipment market experienced a significant downturn in  and the first nine months of as a result  we experienced a significant reduction in demand for products from our semiconductor capital equipment manufacturer and semiconductor device manufacturer customers during these periods 
in the fourth quarter of  we experienced a significant increase in orders and shipments compared to the third quarter of the semiconductor capital equipment industry has been very cyclical  and we cannot determine how long this recent improvement will last 
in the absence of a significant long term improvement  net sales could decline or remain low  and the amount of goodwill  other long lived assets  and inventory considered realizable could be impaired 
a significant portion of our net sales are to operations in international markets 
international net sales include sales by our foreign subsidiaries  but exclude direct export sales  which were less than of our total net sales for each of the years ended december   and international net sales accounted for approximately  and of net sales for the years ended december   and  respectively  a significant portion of which were sales in japan 
we expect that international net sales will continue to represent a significant percentage of our net sales 
recent acquisitions on september   we acquired wenzel instruments  a privately held developer of solid state microelectromechanical system mems based vacuum sensor technology for advanced manufacturing processes 
on january   we completed the acquisition of the eni business eni of emerson electric co 
emerson  a supplier of solid state radio frequency rf and direct current dc plasma power supplies  matching networks and instrumentation to the semiconductor and thin film processing industries 
we acquired eni in order to offer higher value and more integrated application solutions by combining eni s solid state power conversion technology with our core competency in plasma and reactive gas solutions 
the acquisition has been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
also in  we acquired three companies that expanded our position in distributed computer based process control and data management 
on march   we acquired tenta technology ltd 
tenta  a privately held company that designs and supplies modular  computer based process control systems for mm semiconductor process tool applications 
on april   we acquired ipc fab automation gmbh ipc  a privately held developer and provider of web based hardware and software that enables e diagnostics and advanced process control for advanced manufacturing applications 
on october   we acquired equipnet ltd  a privately held company that develops web based connectivity equipment for the semiconductor industry 
the results of operations of these acquired companies are included in our consolidated statement of operations as of and since the respective dates of purchase 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  inventory  warranty costs  intangible assets  goodwill and other long lived assets  in process research and development and income taxes 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
revenue from product sales is recorded upon transfer of title and risk of loss to the customer provided that there is evidence of an arrangement  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
in most transactions  we have no obligations to our customers after the date products are shipped other than pursuant to warranty obligations 
in some instances  we provide installation and training to customers after the product has been shipped 
in accordance with the emerging issues task force eitf accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  we defer the fair value of any undelivered elements until the installation or training is complete 
fair value is the price charged when the element is sold separately 
shipping and handling fees billed to customers  if any  are recognized as revenue 
the related shipping and handling costs are recognized in cost of sales 
we monitor and track the amount of product returns  provide for accounts receivable allowances and reduce revenue at the time of shipment for the estimated amount of such future returns  based on historical experience 
while product returns have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  there is no assurance that we will continue to experience the same return rates that we have in the past 
any significant increase in product return rates could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the period or periods in which such returns materialize 
while we maintain a credit approval process  significant judgments are made by management in connection with assessing our customers ability to pay at the time of shipment 
despite this assessment  from time to time  our customers are unable to meet their payment obligations 
we continuously monitor our customers credit worthiness  and use our judgment in establishing a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  there is no assurance that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of our customers could have a material adverse impact on the collectability of accounts receivable and our future operating results 
inventory 
we value our inventory at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision to write down excess and obsolete inventory to our estimated net realizable value  if less than cost  based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand 
demand for our products can fluctuate significantly  as demonstrated during when we recorded charges for excess and obsolete inventory of million 
the charges were primarily caused by a significant reduction in demand including reduced demand for older technology products 
a significant increase in the demand for our products could result in a short term increase in the cost of inventory purchases from supply shortages or a decrease in the cost of inventory purchases as a result of volume discounts  while a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the charges for excess inventory quantities on hand 
in addition  our industry is subject to technological change  new product development  and product technological obsolescence that could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand 
therefore  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
warranty costs 
we provide for the estimated costs to fulfill customer warranty obligations upon the recognition of the related revenue 
we provide warranty coverage for our products ranging from to months  with the majority of our products ranging from to months 
we estimate the anticipated costs of repairing our products under such warranties based on the historical costs of the repairs and any known specific product issues 
the assumptions we use to estimate warranty accruals are reevaluated periodically in light of actual experience and  when appropriate  the accruals are adjusted 
our determination of the appropriate level of warranty accrual is based upon estimates 
should product failure rates differ from our estimates  actual costs could vary significantly from our expectations 
intangible assets  goodwill and other long lived assets 
we review intangible assets and other long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could indicate an impairment include significant under performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the asset or the strategy for our overall business and significant and negative industry or economic trends 
when we determine that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we compare the undiscounted cash flows to the carrying value of the asset 
if an impairment is indicated  the asset is written down to its estimated fair value 
intangible assets  such as purchased technology  are generally recorded in connection with a business acquisition 
the value assigned to intangible assets is determined based on estimates and judgment regarding expectations for the success and life cycle of products and technology acquired 
if actual product acceptance differs significantly from the estimates  we may be required to record an impairment charge to write down the asset to its net realizable value 
we assess goodwill for impairment at least annually  or more frequently when events and circumstances occur indicating that the recorded goodwill may be impaired 
if the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the implied fair value of goodwill is compared with the carrying amount of goodwill 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value  an impairment loss is recorded in an amount equal to that excess 
the fair value of a reporting unit is estimated using the discounted cash flow approach  and is dependent on estimates and judgments related to future cash flows and discount rates 
if actual cash flows differ significantly from the estimates used by management  we may be required to record an impairment charge to write down the goodwill to its net realizable value 
in process research and development 
we value tangible and intangible assets acquired through our business acquisitions  including in process research and development ipr d  at fair value 
we determine ipr d through established valuation techniques for various projects for the development of new products and technologies and expenses ipr d when technical feasibility is not reached 
the value of ipr d is determined using the income approach  which discounts expected future cash flows from projects under development to their net present value 
each project is analyzed and estimates and judgments are made to determine the technological innovations included  the utilization of core technology  the complexity  cost and time to complete development  any alternative future use or current technological feasibility  and the stage of completion 
during and  we expensed approximately million and million  respectively  in ipr d charges primarily related to the eni acquisition and the on line acquisition because the technological feasibility of certain products under development had not been established and no future alternative uses existed 
if we acquire other companies with ipr d in the future  we will value the ipr d through established valuation techniques and will incur future ipr d charges if those products under development have not reached technical feasibility 
income taxes 
we evaluate the realizability of our net deferred tax assets and assess the need for a valuation allowance on a quarterly basis 
the future benefit to be derived from our deferred tax assets is dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the assets 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax assets to the amount that may be more likely than not to be realized 
to the extent we established a valuation allowance  an expense is recorded within the provision for income taxes line on the statement of income 
during the year ended december   we established a full valuation allowance for our net deferred tax assets and have maintained this valuation allowance through december  in periods subsequent to establishing a valuation allowance  if we were to determine that we would be able to realize our net deferred tax assets in excess of their net recorded amount  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be recorded as a reduction to income tax expense in the period such determination was made 
also in future periods  if we were to determine that we would not be able to realize the recorded amount of our remaining net deferred tax assets  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be recorded as an increase to income tax expense in the period such determination was made 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated the percentage of total net sales of certain line items included in our consolidated statement of operations data year ended december net sales cost of sales gross profit research and development selling  general and administrative amortization of goodwill and acquired intangible assets restructuring and asset impairment charges merger expenses purchase of in process technology loss from operations interest income expense  net income from litigation settlement other expense income  net loss before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net loss year ended compared to net sales 
net sales increased million or to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  international net sales were approximately million for the year ended december  or of net sales and million for the year ended december  or of net sales 
during the year ended december   we acquired eni  tenta and ipc 
these acquisitions increased our net sales by million for the year ended december   as they were included in net sales for the full period in while net sales for the year ended december  includes their revenues only from the date of acquisition 
the remaining increase in was the result of increased service revenues as well as increased demand for our products from our semiconductor capital equipment manufacturer customers  particularly in the fourth quarter  as compared to the year ended december  the increase in service revenues  which represents less than of total net sales  has been driven by the prolonged slow down in the semiconductor capital equipment market  as customers tried to maintain equipment rather than invest in new capital 
gross profit 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the increase in gross profit percent is mainly due to a slight increase in volumes that increased our fixed cost absorption and a favorable foreign exchange impact  offset by higher materials costs of new products in initial production runs 
research and development 
our research and development efforts are directed toward developing and improving our instruments  components  subsystems and process control solutions for semiconductor and advanced thin film processing applications and identifying and developing products for new applications for which gas management plays a critical role 
although overall business activity was down throughout most of  and we implemented initiatives to reduce costs  we continued to invest in research and development activities 
research and development expense increased million or to million or of net sales for the year ended december  from million or of net sales for the year ended december  the increase was due mainly to increased compensation expense of million  as a result of including a full year of costs in of the companies acquired during and an increase in project material costs of million 
our research and development efforts include numerous projects which generally have a duration of to months 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million or to million or of net sales for the year ended december  from million or of net sales for the year ended december  the decrease was due primarily to lower compensation expense  as a result of lower headcount  of million resulting from cost savings initiatives and decreased professional fees of million 
amortization of acquired intangible assets 
for the year ended december   amortization expense was million  an increase of million or from the million for the year ended december  the increase in amortization was due to a full year of amortization of intangibles in from companies acquired in restructuring  asset impairment and other charges 
during  we continued the consolidation to accelerate product development  rationalize manufacturing operations  and reduce operating costs of prior acquisitions that was started in in  we recorded restructuring  asset impairment and other charges of million  consisting of million of severance costs related to workforce reductions  million of lease cost  professional fees and other costs related to facility consolidations and an asset impairment charge of million 
the workforce reduction was across all functional groups 
in  this consolidation of prior acquisitions resulted in recording restructuring and asset impairment charges of million 
the charges consisted of million of severance costs related to a workforce reduction  million related to consolidation of leased facilities  and an asset impairment charge of million primarily related to the impairment of an intangible asset from the discontinuance of certain product development activities 
the workforce reduction was across all functional groups and consisted of employees 
we anticipate incurring additional restructuring charges in  related to prior year initiatives  of up to million as we complete the consolidation of leased facilities 
a summary of the restructuring charges  asset impairments and other charges during and  and the related accrual balance is outlined as follows workforce asset facility reductions impairment consolidations total in thousands restructuring provision in   charges utilized in  reserve balance as of december  restructuring provision in   charges utilized in  reserve balance as of december  the remaining accrual for workforce reductions is expected to be paid by the second quarter of the facilities consolidation charges will be paid over the respective lease terms  the latest of which ends in the accrual for severance costs and lease payments is recorded in other accrued expenses and other liabilities 
purchase of in process technology 
there was no purchase of in process research and development expenses in in process research and development of million for the year ended december  arose from the acquisitions we made in in january  we acquired eni in a transaction accounted for under the purchase method 
the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired  including intangible assets  based on their estimated fair values 
the intangible assets include approximately million for acquired in process technology for projects  generally expected to have durations of months  that did not have future alternative uses 
the value of the purchased in process technology was determined using the income approach  which discounts expected future cash flows from projects under development to their net present value 
each project was analyzed to determine the technological innovations included  the utilization of core technology  the complexity  cost and time to complete development  any alternative future use or current technological feasibility  and the stage of completion 
the cash flows derived from the in process technology projects were discounted at rates ranging from to 
we believe these rates were appropriate given the risks associated with the technologies for which commercial feasibility had not been established 
the percentage of completion for each in process project was determined by identifying the cost incurred to date of the project as a ratio of the total cost required to bring the project to technical and commercial feasibility 
the percentage completion for in process projects acquired ranged from to complete  based on our estimates of tasks completed and the tasks to be completed to bring the projects to technological and commercial feasibility 
at the date of the acquisition  the development of these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility  and the technology in progress had no alternative future uses 
accordingly  these costs were expensed in interest income expense  net 
for the year ended december   net interest income was million  a decrease of million from the million for the year ended december  the decrease in net interest income in is mainly related to slightly lower investment balances and lower interest rates in income from litigation settlement 
on november   applied science and technology  inc astex  which we acquired in january  brought suit in federal district court in delaware against advanced energy industries  inc for infringement of astex s patent related to its astron product 
on may   a jury affirmed the validity of our patent and found that advanced energy infringed the patent 
on may   based on the jury s findings  the court entered a judgment on the infringement claim in favor of us and against advanced energy  and awarded million in damages to compensate us for advanced energy s infringing activity 
advanced energy filed motions to overturn the verdict 
during august of  we entered into an agreement with advanced energy whereby advanced energy agreed to pay the awarded damages amount to us and withdraw its motions to overturn the verdict 
we received the million in september  and recorded the amount as income from litigation settlement 
other income expense 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a gain of million from the early repayment of premiums related to a split dollar life insurance policy covering the chairman and ceo of the company 
during  we sold certain assets for proceeds of approximately million  including a note receivable of approximately million and warrants of million 
during  due to the downturn in the semiconductor industry and its result on the acquirer s operations  and the acquirer s inability to raise financing  we considered the value of the note and warrants to be impaired 
accordingly  during  we recorded a charge of million to other expense for our estimate of the impairment on the note receivable and warrants 
provision benefit for income taxes 
we recorded a provision for income taxes of million for the year ended december   as compared to a tax benefit of million for the year ended december  as a result of incurring significant operating losses since  we determined that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets may not be realized  and since the fourth quarter of have established a full valuation allowance for our net deferred tax assets 
accordingly  we have not recorded a deferred tax benefit from the net operating loss incurred in the year ended december  the provision for income taxes in is comprised of tax expense from foreign operations and state taxes 
until an appropriate level of profitability is reached  we will not record deferred tax benefits from our net operating losses in future results of operations 
year ended compared to net sales 
net sales increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  international net sales were approximately million for the year ended december  or of net sales and million for the year ended december  or of net sales 
the increase in worldwide net sales in is from the partial year revenues of million from eni  tenta and ipc  companies which were acquired during the year 
this increase was offset by a decline of million or  due to the worldwide slowdown in demand for our products from our semiconductor capital equipment manufacturer and semiconductor device manufacturer customers  which began in the first quarter of and continued through gross profit 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the increase in gross margin was primarily due to lower provisions for excess and obsolete inventory in compared to in  we recorded significant charges for excess and obsolete inventory of million  or of net sales 
these charges were primarily caused by a significant reduction in demand  including demand for older technology products 
during  we realized a benefit of million in cost of sales  or of net sales  from sales of inventory which were included as part of the excess and obsolete inventory charges in the lower excess and obsolete inventory charges in were offset by the addition of manufacturing overhead costs from the companies acquired in  which resulted in a decrease in gross margin of approximately research and development 
research and development expense increased to million or of net sales for the year ended december  from million or of net sales for the year ended december  compensation expense increased by million during  which was comprised of an increase of million from the companies acquired during the year  offset by a million decrease resulting from cost saving programs including workforce reductions  salary reductions  and furloughs 
also  expenses for project materials increased million during  primarily from the companies acquired during the year 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million or of net sales for the year ended december  from million or of net sales for the year ended december  the increase was due to increased compensation expense of million primarily from the companies acquired during the year  increased professional fees of million and other selling  general and administrative expenses 
amortization of goodwill and acquired intangible assets 
amortization expense of million for the year ended december   represents the amortization of the identifiable intangibles resulting from the acquisitions completed by us 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we ceased amortizing goodwill on january  amortization of goodwill and acquired intangible assets of million for the year ended december   represents the amortization of goodwill and other intangibles resulting from the acquisitions completed by us  of which million relates to acquired intangibles and million relates to goodwill 
merger costs 
on january  we completed our acquisition of astex in a transaction accounted for under the pooling of interests method of accounting 
under the pooling of interests method of accounting  fees and expenses related to the merger are expensed in the period of the merger 
during the year ended december   we expensed approximately million of merger related expenses  consisting of million of investment banking  legal  accounting  printing and other professional fees  and million of regulatory and other costs 
purchase of in process technology 
in process research and development of million and million for the years ended december  and arose from the acquisitions we made in and  respectively 
as discussed previously above  the million of in process research and development expenses in related to our acquisition of eni in january in april  we acquired on line in a transaction accounted for under the purchase method 
the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired  including intangible assets  based on their estimated fair values 
the intangible assets included approximately million for acquired in process technology for various projects  generally expected to have durations of to months  that did not have future alternative uses 
the value of the purchased in process technology was determined using the income approach  which discounts expected future cash flows from projects under development to their net present value 
each project was analyzed to determine the technological innovations included  the utilization of core technology  the complexity  cost and time to complete development  any alternative future use or current technological feasibility  and the stage of completion 
the cash flows derived from the in process technology projects were discounted at a rate of 
we believe this rate was appropriate given the risks associated with the technologies for which commercial feasibility had not been established 
the percentage of completion for each in process project was determined by identifying the elapsed time invested in the project as a ratio of the total time required to bring the project to technical and commercial feasibility 
the percentage of completion for in process projects acquired ranged from to  based on management s estimates of tasks completed and the tasks to be completed to bring the projects to technological and commercial feasibility 
at the date of the acquisition  the development of these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility  and the technology in progress had no alternative future uses 
accordingly  these costs were expensed in restructuring and asset impairment charges 
during we implemented a consolidation of recent acquisitions to accelerate product development  rationalize manufacturing operations  and reduce operating costs 
as a result of these actions  we recorded restructuring and asset impairment charges of million in the charges consisted of million of severance costs related to a workforce reduction  million related to consolidation of leased facilities  and an asset impairment charge of million primarily related to the impairment of an intangible asset from the discontinuance of certain product development activities 
the fair value of the impaired intangible asset was determined using the expected present value of future cash flows 
the workforce reduction was across all functional groups and consisted of employees 
severance costs of million were paid during the facilities consolidation charges will be paid over the respective lease terms  the latest of which ends in when we acquired the shamrock product line  it was expected that sales of the existing system design and development of new system designs would generate future revenues 
we had provided potential customers with purchase quotations for shamrock systems  including a significant quotation to a potential customer in january for the sale of several systems 
the potential customer did not purchase the systems  and the quotation expired in march we were unsuccessful in selling any systems of the product line after the acquisition and  with the expiration of the significant quote in march  we evaluated the recoverability of the long lived assets  primarily goodwill 
as a result  based on discounted cash flow analysis we recorded an impairment charge for the carrying value of the related goodwill of approximately million in the quarter ended march  interest income expense  net 
during the year ended december   we generated net interest income of million  primarily from interest on our invested cash and investments  offset by interest expense of million on outstanding debt 
interest income declined million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease was due to lower interest rate yields on investments during compared to income from litigation settlement 
on november   astex  which we acquired in january  brought suit in federal district court in delaware against advanced energy for infringement of astex s patent related to its astron product 
on may   a jury affirmed the validity of our patent and found that advanced energy infringed the patent 
on may   based on the jury s findings  the court entered a judgment on the infringement claim in favor of us and against advanced energy  and awarded million in damages to compensate us for advanced energy s infringing activity 
advanced energy filed motions to overturn the verdict 
during august of  we entered into an agreement with advanced energy whereby advanced energy agreed to pay the awarded damages amount to us and withdraw its motions to overturn the verdict 
we received the million and recorded the amount as income from litigation settlement 
other expense  net 
during  we recorded a loss on the sale of an investment in a company of million  which was recorded as other expense 
also during  we sold certain assets for proceeds of approximately million  including a note receivable of approximately million and warrants of million 
the loss on the transaction was million and was recorded as other expense in during  due to the downturn in the semiconductor industry and its result on the acquirer s operations  and the acquirer s inability to raise financing  we considered the value of the note and warrants to be impaired 
accordingly  during  we recorded a charge of million to other expense for our estimate of the impairment on the note receivable and warrants 
benefit for income taxes 
we recorded a benefit for income taxes of million for the year ended december   for an effective tax rate of 
we recorded a benefit for income taxes of million for the year ended december   for an effective tax rate of in the change in our effective tax rate from to was primarily due to the recording of a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets in as a result of incurring significant operating losses during and  and the continuing uncertainty in the semiconductor industry  management determined that it is more likely than not our deferred tax assets may not be realized and  accordingly  recorded a charge of million to establish a full valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets in the fourth quarter of the benefit for income taxes of million for the year ended december  is primarily comprised of an estimated current tax benefit of million from united states net operating losses offset by million of tax expense from foreign operations and state taxes 
liquidity and capital resources since our initial public offering we have financed our operations and capital requirements through a combination of cash provided by operations  long term real estate financing and short term borrowings 
cash  cash equivalents and short term marketable securities totaled million at december   compared to million at december  in addition  in january  we issued  shares of our common stock at per share in a public offering  which generated net proceeds of approximately million 
net cash used in operating activities of million for the year ended december   was impacted by the net loss of million and an increase in operating assets of million  offset by non cash charges of million for depreciation and amortization and an increase in operating liabilities of million 
the increase in operating assets consisted mainly of an increase in accounts receivable of million due to the increased shipments in the fourth quarter of as compared to the fourth quarter of  which contributed to a slight increase in our days sales outstanding from days at the end of to days in  and an increase in inventory of million as a result of increased production volumes in the fourth quarter of the increase in operating liabilities consisted primarily of an increase in accounts payable of million resulting from increased production activity in the fourth quarter 
net cash provided by operating activities of million for the year ended december  resulted mainly from non cash charges for depreciation and amortization of million  purchases of in process technology of million related mainly to the eni acquisition  asset impairment charges of million consisting primarily of the write off of an impaired note receivable and a decrease in operating assets and liabilities of million  all of which were partially offset by the net loss of million 
the decrease in operating assets consisted of a reduction in other current assets of million from the receipt of income tax refunds in and a decrease in inventory of million  offset by decreases in accrued expenses of million 
net cash used in investing activities of million for the year ended december  resulted mainly from the net purchases of million of available for sale securities  the purchase of property  plant and equipment of million  and the purchase of a small technology business for million 
net cash used in investing activities of million for the year ended december  consisted mainly of net purchases of short term and long term investments of million  million for the acquisition of businesses and million for the purchases of capital assets  partially offset by million in proceeds from the sale of assets 
net cash provided by financing activities of million for the year ended december  consisted of million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and purchases under the employee stock purchase plan  net proceeds of million from short term borrowings  offset by million of principal payments on long term debt and capital lease obligations 
net cash provided by financing activities of million for the year ended december  consisted mainly of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and purchases under the employee stock purchase plan of million and million in net proceeds from short term borrowings offset by principal payments of million on long term debt and capital lease obligations 
on july   our million unsecured credit facility with two domestic banks expired and we elected not to renew this facility 
there had been no borrowings made under this line of credit 
certain of our foreign subsidiaries have credit lines and short term borrowing arrangements with various financial institutions which provide for aggregate borrowings as of december  of up to million  which generally expire and are renewed in six month intervals 
at december   total borrowings outstanding under these arrangements totaled million with million available for future borrowings 
future payments due under debt  lease and purchase commitment obligations as of december  in thousands are as follows payment due by period less than contractual obligations total year years years after years debt     interest on debt  capital leases operating leases     purchase obligations   other long term liabilities   total      excluded from other long term liabilities was million of operating leases related to restructuring charges that have been accrued on our balance sheet as they are included in the operating leases amount above 
we believe that our working capital  together with the cash anticipated to be generated from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our estimated working capital and planned capital expenditure requirements through at least the next months 
to the extent permitted by massachusetts law  our restated articles of organization  as amended  requires us to indemnify any of our current or former officers or directors or any person who has served or is serving in any capacity with respect to any of our employee benefit plans 
because no claim for indemnification has been made by any person covered by the relevant provisions of our restated articles of organization  we believe that the estimated exposure for these indemnification obligations is currently minimal 
accordingly  we have no liabilities recorded for these requirements as of december  we also enter into standard indemnification agreements in the ordinary course of business 
pursuant to these agreements  we indemnify  hold harmless and agree to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party  generally our customers  in connection with any patent  or any other intellectual property infringement claim by any third party with respect to our products 
the term of these indemnification agreements is generally perpetual any time after execution of the agreement 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is  in some instances  unlimited 
we have never incurred costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification agreements 
as a result  we believe the estimated fair value of these agreements is minimal 
accordingly  we have no liabilities recorded for these agreements as of december  when as part of an acquisition  we acquire all of the stock or all of the assets and liabilities of another company  we assume liability for certain events or occurrences that took place prior to the date of acquisition 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make for such obligations is undeterminable at this time 
other than obligations recorded as liabilities at the time of the acquisitions  historically we have not made significant payments for these indemnifications 
accordingly  no liabilities have been recorded for these obligations 
in conjunction with certain asset sales  we may provide routine indemnifications whose terms range in duration and often are not explicitly defined 
where appropriate  an obligation for such indemnifications is recorded as a liability 
because the amount of liability under these types of indemnifications are not explicitly stated  the overall maximum amount of the obligation under such indemnifications cannot be reasonably estimated 
other than obligations recorded as liabilities at the time of the asset sale  historically we have not made significant payments for these indemnifications 
derivatives we conduct our operations globally 
consequently the results of our operations are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
we hedge a portion of our forecasted foreign currency denominated intercompany sales of inventory  over a maximum period of fifteen months  using forward exchange contracts and currency options primarily related to japanese and european currencies 
these derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges  and changes in their fair value are carried in accumulated other comprehensive income until the hedged transaction affects earnings 
when the hedged transaction affects earnings  the appropriate gain or loss from the derivative designated as a hedge of the transaction is reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to cost of sales 
as of december  the amount that will be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to earnings over the next twelve months is an unrealized loss of million  net of taxes 
the ineffective portion of the derivatives  primarily related to option premiums  is recorded in cost of sales and were immaterial in  and we hedge certain intercompany and other payables with foreign exchange contracts and currency options 
since these derivatives hedge existing amounts that are denominated in foreign currencies  the derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting 
the foreign exchange gain or loss on these derivatives was immaterial in  and realized and unrealized gains and losses on forward exchange contracts and local currency purchased option contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognized immediately in earnings 
the cash flows resulting from forward exchange contracts and local currency purchased options that qualify for hedge accounting are classified in the statement of cash flows as part of cash flows from operating activities 
cash flows resulting from forward exchange contracts and local currency purchased options that do not qualify for hedge accounting are classified in the statement of cash flows as investing activities 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
there were forward exchange contracts with notional amounts totaling million outstanding at december  of such forward exchange contracts  million were outstanding to exchange japanese yen for us dollars 
there were forward exchange contracts with notional amounts totaling million outstanding at december  of which million were outstanding to exchange japanese yen for us dollars 
there were no forward exchange contracts outstanding at december  local currency purchased options with notional amounts totaling  million and million to exchange foreign currencies for us dollars were outstanding at december   and  respectively 
foreign exchange gains and losses on forward exchange contracts and currency options which did not qualify for hedge accounting were immaterial during and there were no foreign exchange gains or losses on forward exchange contracts which did not qualify for hedge accounting in gains and losses on forward exchange contracts and local currency purchased options that qualify for hedge accounting are classified in cost of goods sold and totaled a loss of million for the year ended december  and a gain of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the fair values of local currency purchased options at december  and  which were obtained through dealer quotes  were immaterial 
there were no purchased options outstanding at december  off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any financial partnerships with unconsolidated entities  such as entities often referred to as structured finance  special purpose entities or variable interest entities which are often established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
accordingly  we are not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had such relationships 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 as amended by fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb fin 
the primary objectives of fin are to provide guidance on the identification of entities for which control is achieved through means other than through voting rights variable interest entities or vies and how to determine when and which business enterprise should consolidate the vie 
this new model for consolidation applies to an entity which either a the equity investors if any do not have a controlling financial interest  or b the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity s activities without receiving additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
in addition  fin requires that both the primary beneficiary and all other enterprises with a significant variable interest in a vie make additional disclosures 
fin is effective for all new vies created or acquired after january  for vies created or acquired prior to february   the provisions of fin must be applied for the first interim or annual period ending after march  we have not created or acquired any vies 
the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
factors that may affect future results our business depends substantially on capital spending in the semiconductor industry which is characterized by periodic fluctuations that may cause a reduction in demand for our products 
we estimate that approximately  and of our net sales for the years ended december   and  respectively  were to semiconductor capital equipment manufacturers and semiconductor device manufacturers  and we expect that sales to such customers will continue to account for a substantial majority of our sales 
our business depends upon the capital expenditures of semiconductor device manufacturers  which in turn depend upon the demand for semiconductors 
periodic reductions in demand for the products manufactured by semiconductor capital equipment manufacturers and semiconductor device manufacturers may adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
historically  the semiconductor market has been highly cyclical and has experienced periods of overcapacity  resulting in significantly reduced demand for capital equipment 
most recently  in and  we experienced a significant reduction in demand from oem customers  and lower gross margins due to reduced absorption of manufacturing overhead 
as a result of this significant reduction in demand  particularly for older technology products  we incurred significant charges for excess and obsolete inventory of million in in addition  many semiconductor manufacturers have operations and customers in asia  a region which in recent years has experienced serious economic problems including currency devaluations  debt defaults  lack of liquidity and recessions 
we cannot be certain that semiconductor downturns will not continue or recur 
a decline in the level of orders as a result of any future downturn or slowdown in the semiconductor capital equipment industry could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our quarterly operating results have varied  and are likely to continue to vary significantly 
this may result in volatility in the market price of our common stock 
a substantial portion of our shipments occur shortly after an order is received and therefore we operate with a low level of backlog 
as a result  a decrease in demand for our products from one or more customers could occur with limited advance notice and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any particular period 
a significant percentage of our expenses are relatively fixed and based in part on expectations of future net sales 
the inability to adjust spending quickly enough to compensate for any shortfall would magnify the adverse impact of a shortfall in net sales on our results of operations 
factors that could cause fluctuations in our net sales include the timing of the receipt of orders from major customers  shipment delays  disruption in sources of supply  seasonal variations of capital spending by customers  production capacity constraints  and specific features requested by customers 
for example  the semiconductor capital equipment market experienced a significant downturn during and as a result  we experienced a reduction in demand from oem customers  which has had a material adverse effect on our quarterly operating results during these years 
during  gross margins were negatively affected by significant charges for excess and obsolete inventory of million in the second quarter and million in the fourth quarter 
these charges were primarily caused by a significant reduction in demand including reduced demand for older technology products 
as a result of the factors discussed above  it is likely that we may in the future experience quarterly or annual fluctuations and that  in one or more future quarters  our operating results may fall below the expectations of public market analysts or investors 
in any such event  the price of our common stock could decline significantly 
the loss of net sales to any one of our major customers would likely have a material adverse effect on us 
our top ten customers accounted for approximately  and of our net sales for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the loss of a major customer or any reduction in orders by these customers  including reductions due to market or competitive conditions  would likely have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
during the years ended december   and  one customer  applied materials  accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of our net sales 
none of our significant customers  including applied materials  has entered into an agreement requiring it to purchase any minimum quantity of our products 
the demand for our products from our semiconductor capital equipment customers depends in part on orders received by them from their semiconductor device manufacturer customers 
attempts to lessen the adverse effect of any loss or reduction of net sales through the rapid addition of new customers could be difficult because prospective customers typically require lengthy qualification periods prior to placing volume orders with a new supplier 
our future success will continue to depend upon our ability to maintain relationships with existing key customers  our ability to attract new customers  our ability to introduce new products in a timely manner for existing and new customers  and the success of our customers in creating demand for their capital equipment products which incorporate our products 
as part of our business strategy  we have entered into and may enter into or seek to enter into business combinations and acquisitions that may be difficult to integrate  disrupt our business  dilute stockholder value or divert management attention 
we have made several acquisitions since as a part of our business strategy  we may enter into additional business combinations and acquisitions 
acquisitions are typically accompanied by a number of risks  including the difficulty of integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired companies  the potential disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management  expenses related to the acquisition and potential unknown liabilities associated with acquired businesses 
as a result of our recent acquisitions  we have added several different decentralized accounting systems  resulting in a complex reporting environment 
we expect that we will need to continue to modify our accounting policies  internal controls  procedures and compliance programs to provide consistency across all our operations 
if we are not successful in completing acquisitions that we may pursue in the future  we may be required to reevaluate our growth strategy  and we may incur substantial expenses and devote significant management time and resources in seeking to complete proposed acquisitions that will not generate benefits for us 
in addition  with future acquisitions  we could use substantial portions of our available cash as all or a portion of the purchase price 
we could also issue additional securities as consideration for these acquisitions  which could cause significant stockholder dilution 
our recent acquisitions and any future acquisitions may not ultimately help us achieve our strategic goals and may pose other risks to us 
we have had significant operating and net losses  and we may have future losses 
we have not reported an annual operating profit or annual net income since we cannot predict whether we will experience operating losses and net losses in the future 
an inability to convince semiconductor device manufacturers to specify the use of our products to our customers  that are semiconductor capital equipment manufacturers  would weaken our competitive position 
the markets for our products are highly competitive 
our competitive success often depends upon factors outside of our control 
for example  in some cases  particularly with respect to mass flow controllers  semiconductor device manufacturers may direct semiconductor capital equipment manufacturers to use a specified supplier s product in their equipment 
accordingly  for such products  our success will depend in part on our ability to have semiconductor device manufacturers specify that our products be used at their semiconductor fabrication facilities 
in addition  we may encounter difficulties in changing established relationships of competitors that already have a large installed base of products within such semiconductor fabrication facilities 
if our products are not designed into successive generations of our customers products  we will lose significant net sales during the lifespan of those products 
new products designed by semiconductor capital equipment manufacturers typically have a lifespan of five to ten years 
our success depends on our products being designed into new generations of equipment for the semiconductor industry 
we must develop products that are technologically current so that they are positioned to be chosen for use in each successive generation of semiconductor capital equipment 
if our products are not chosen by our customers  our net sales may be reduced during the lifespan of our customers products 
in addition  we must make a significant capital investment to develop products for our customers well before our products are introduced and before we can be sure that we will recover our capital investment through sales to the customers in significant volume 
we are thus also at risk during the development phase that our products may fail to meet our customers technical or cost requirements and may be replaced by a competitive product or alternative technology solution 
if that happens  we may be unable to recover our development costs 
the semiconductor industry is subject to rapid demand shifts which are difficult to predict 
as a result  our inability to expand our manufacturing capacity in response to these rapid shifts may cause a reduction in our market share 
our ability to increase sales of certain products depends in part upon our ability to expand our manufacturing capacity for such products in a timely manner 
if we are unable to expand our manufacturing capacity on a timely basis or to manage such expansion effectively  our customers could implement our competitors products and  as a result  our market share could be reduced 
because the semiconductor industry is subject to rapid demand shifts which are difficult to foresee  we may not be able to increase capacity quickly enough to respond to a rapid increase in demand in the semiconductor industry 
additionally  capacity expansion could increase our fixed operating expenses and if sales levels do not increase to offset the additional expense levels associated with any such expansion  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
we operate in a highly competitive industry 
the market for our products is highly competitive 
principal competitive factors include historical customer relationships  product quality  performance and price  breadth of product line  manufacturing capabilities  and customer service and support 
although we believe that we compete favorably with respect to these factors  there can be no assurance that we will continue to do so 
we encounter substantial competition in most of our product lines 
certain of our competitors may have greater financial and other resources than we have 
in some cases  competitors are smaller than we are  but well established in specific product niches 
we may encounter difficulties in changing established relationships of competitors with a large installed base of products at such customers fabrication facilities 
in addition  our competitors can be expected to continue to improve the design and performance of their products 
there can be no assurance that competitors will not develop products that offer price or performance features superior to those of our products 
sales to foreign markets constitute a substantial portion of our net sales  therefore  our net sales and results of operations could be adversely affected by downturns in economic conditions in countries outside of the united states 
international sales include sales by our foreign subsidiaries  but exclude direct export sales  which were less than of our total net sales for each of the years ended december   and international sales accounted for approximately  and of net sales for the years ended december   and  respectively  a significant portion of which were sales to japan 
we anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our net sales 
in addition  certain of our key domestic customers derive a significant portion of their revenues from sales in international markets 
therefore  our sales and results of operations could be adversely affected by economic slowdowns and other risks associated with international sales 
risks relating to our international operations could adversely affect our operating results 
we have substantial international sales  service and manufacturing operations in europe and asia  which exposes us to foreign operational and political risks that may harm our business 
our international operations are subject to inherent risks  which may adversely affect us  including political and economic instability in countries where we have sales  service and manufacturing operations  particularly in asia  fluctuations in the value of currencies and high levels of inflation  particularly in asia and europe  changes in labor conditions and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  including  but not limited to  labor unions  greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and longer payment cycles  burdens and costs of compliance with a variety of foreign laws  increases in duties and taxation  imposition of restrictions on currency conversion or the transfer of funds  changes in export duties and limitations on imports or exports  expropriation of private enterprises  and unexpected changes in foreign regulations 
if any of these risks materialize  our operating results may be adversely affected 
unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations may lead to lower gross margins  or may cause us to raise prices which could result in reduced sales 
currency exchange rate fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our net sales and results of operations and we could experience losses with respect to our hedging activities 
unfavorable currency fluctuations could require us to increase prices to foreign customers which could result in lower net sales by us to such customers 
alternatively  if we do not adjust the prices for our products in response to unfavorable currency fluctuations  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
in addition  sales made by our foreign subsidiaries are denominated in the currency of the country in which these products are sold and the currency they receive in payment for such sales could be less valuable at the time of receipt as a result of exchange rate fluctuations 
we enter into forward exchange contracts and local currency purchased options to reduce currency exposure arising from intercompany sales of inventory 
however  we cannot be certain that our efforts will be adequate to protect us against significant currency fluctuations or that such efforts will not expose us to additional exchange rate risks 
key personnel may be difficult to attract and retain 
our success depends to a large extent upon the efforts and abilities of a number of key employees and officers  particularly those with expertise in the semiconductor manufacturing and similar industrial manufacturing industries 
the loss of key employees or officers could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we believe that our future success will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical  financial  managerial and marketing personnel 
we cannot be certain that we will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel 
our proprietary technology is important to the continued success of our business 
our failure to protect this proprietary technology may significantly impair our competitive position 
as of december   we owned us patents  foreign patents and had pending us patent applications 
although we seek to protect our intellectual property rights through patents  copyrights  trade secrets and other measures  we cannot be certain that we will be able to protect our technology adequately  competitors will not be able to develop similar technology independently  any of our pending patent applications will be issued  intellectual property laws will protect our intellectual property rights  or third parties will not assert that our products infringe patent  copyright or trade secrets of such parties 
protection of our intellectual property rights may result in costly litigation 
litigation may be necessary in order to enforce our patents  copyrights or other intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets  to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement 
we have been in the past  and currently are  involved in lawsuits enforcing and defending  our intellectual property rights  and may be involved in such litigation in the future 
such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may need to expend significant time and expense to protect our intellectual property regardless of the validity or successful outcome of such intellectual property claims 
if we lose any litigation  we may be required to seek licenses from others or change  stop manufacturing or stop selling some of our products 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate for reasons over which we have no control 
the stock market has from time to time experienced  and is likely to continue to experience  extreme price and volume fluctuations 
prices of securities of technology companies have been especially volatile and have often fluctuated for reasons that are unrelated to the operating performance of the companies 
the market price of shares of our common stock has fluctuated greatly since our initial public offering and could continue to fluctuate due to a variety of factors 
in the past  companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been the objects of securities class action litigation 
if we were the object of securities class action litigation  it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management s attention and resources 
our dependence on sole  limited source suppliers  and international suppliers  could affect our ability to manufacture products and systems 
we rely on sole  limited source suppliers  and international suppliers  for a few of our components and subassemblies that are critical to the manufacturing of our products 
this reliance involves several risks  including the following the potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of required components  reduced control over pricing and timing of delivery of components  and the potential inability of our suppliers to develop technologically advanced products to support our growth and development of new systems 
we believe that in time we could obtain and qualify alternative sources for most sole  limited source and international supplier parts 
seeking alternative sources of the parts could require us to redesign our systems  resulting in increased costs and likely shipping delays 
we may be unable to redesign our systems  which could result in further costs and shipping delays 
these increased costs would decrease our profit margins if we could not pass the costs to our customers 
further  shipping delays could damage our relationships with current and potential customers and have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
we are subject to governmental regulations 
if we fail to comply with these regulations  our business could be harmed 
we are subject to federal  state  local and foreign regulations  including environmental regulations and regulations relating to the design and operation of our power supply products 
we must ensure that these systems meet certain safety standards  many of which vary across the countries in which our systems are used 
for example  the european union has published directives specifically relating to power supplies 
we must comply with these directives in order to ship our systems into countries that are members of the european union 
we believe we are in compliance with current applicable regulations  directives and standards and have obtained all necessary permits  approvals  and authorizations to conduct our business 
however  compliance with future regulations  directives and standards could require us to modify or redesign certain systems  make capital expenditures or incur substantial costs 
if we do not comply with current or future regulations  directives and standards we could be subject to fines  our production could be suspended  or we could be prohibited from offering particular systems in specified markets 
certain stockholders have a substantial interest in us and may be able to exert substantial influence over our actions 
as of january   john r 
bertucci  our chairman  chief executive officer and president  and certain members of his family  in the aggregate  beneficially owned approximately of our outstanding common stock 
as a result  these stockholders  acting together  are able to exert substantial influence over our actions 
pursuant to the acquisition of the eni business of emerson electric co 
emerson  we issued approximately  shares of common stock to emerson and its wholly owned subsidiary  astec america  inc emerson owned approximately of our outstanding common stock as of january   and james g 
berges  the president and a director of emerson  is a member of our board of directors 
accordingly  emerson is able to exert substantial influence over our actions 
some provisions of our restated articles of organization  as amended  our amended and restated by laws and massachusetts law could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control of us 
anti takeover provisions could diminish the opportunities for stockholders to participate in tender offers  including tender offers at a price above the then current market price of the common stock 
such provisions may also inhibit increases in the market price of the common stock that could result from takeover attempts 
for example  while we have no present plans to issue any preferred stock  our board of directors  without further stockholder approval  may issue preferred stock that could have the effect of delaying  deterring or preventing a change in control of us 
the issuance of preferred stock could adversely affect the voting power of the holders of our common stock  including the loss of voting control to others 
in addition  our amended and restated by laws provide for a classified board of directors consisting of three classes 
the classified board could also have the effect of delaying  deterring or preventing a change in control of us 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk and sensitivity analysis our primary exposures to market risks include fluctuations in interest rates on our investment portfolio  short and long term debt as well as fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
foreign exchange rate risk we enter into local currency purchased options and forward exchange contracts to reduce currency exposure arising from intercompany sales of inventory 
the potential fair value loss for a hypothetical adverse change in currency exchange rates on our local currency purchased options at december  was immaterial 
there were no local currency purchased options outstanding at december  the potential loss in was estimated by calculating the fair value of the local currency purchased options at december  and comparing that with those calculated using the hypothetical currency exchange rates 
there were forward exchange contracts with notional amounts totaling million and million outstanding at december  and  respectively 
of such forward exchange contracts  million and million  respectively  were outstanding to exchange japanese yen for us dollars with the remaining amounts relating to the british pound and euro 
the potential fair value loss for a hypothetical adverse change in the forward currency exchange rate on our forward exchange contracts at december  and would be million and million  respectively 
the potential losses in and were estimated by calculating the fair value of the forward exchange contracts at december  and and comparing that with those calculated using the hypothetical forward currency exchange rates 
at december   mks had  related to short term borrowings and current portion of long term debt denominated in japanese yen 
the carrying value of these short term borrowings approximates fair value due to their short period to maturity 
assuming a hypothetical adverse change in the japanese yen to us dollar year end exchange rate  the fair value of these short term borrowings would increase by  the potential increase in fair value was estimated by calculating the fair value of the short term borrowings at december  and comparing that with the fair value using the hypothetical year end exchange rate 
at december   mks had  related to short term borrowings denominated in japanese yen 
the carrying value of these short term borrowings approximates fair value due to their short period to maturity 
assuming a hypothetical adverse change in the japanese yen to us dollar year end exchange rate  the fair value of these short term borrowings would increase by  the potential increase in fair value was estimated by calculating the fair value of the short term borrowings at december  and comparing that with the fair value using the hypothetical year end exchange rate 
interest rate risk due to its short term duration  the fair value of our cash and investment portfolio at december  and approximated its carrying value 
interest rate risk was estimated as the potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical increase in interest rates for securities contained in the investment portfolio 
the resulting hypothetical fair value was not materially different from the year end carrying values 
our total long term debt outstanding  including the current portion  at december  and  was million and million  respectively  and consisted mainly of a mortgage note and industrial development revenue bond 
the interest rates on these debt instruments are variable and range from to at december  and to at december  due to the immaterial amounts of the outstanding debt  a hypothetical change of in interest rates would not have a material effect on our near term financial condition or results of operations 
the company from time to time has outstanding short term borrowings with variable interest rates  primarily denominated in japanese yen 
at december  and  we had million and million  respectively  outstanding related to these short term borrowings at interest rates ranging from to 
due to the short term nature and amount of this short term debt  a hypothetical change of in interest rates would not have a material effect on our near term financial condition or results of operations
