item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our business and results of operations are substantially dependent upon the demand for ate by semiconductor manufacturers and companies that specialize in the testing of ics 
demand for ate is driven by semiconductor manufacturers that are opening new  or expanding existing  semiconductor fabrication facilities or upgrading existing equipment  which in turn is dependent upon the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductors and products incorporating semiconductors 
the semiconductor industry has been highly cyclical with recurring periods of oversupply  which often have a severe impact on the semiconductor industry s demand for ate  including the products we manufacture 
this cyclicality has been clearly demonstrated during the past eight years  with downward cycles in  and and up cycles in  and net revenues and bookings the most recent downturn  which began during the fourth quarter of and reversed in  was the most severe and prolonged downturn the ate industry has ever experienced 
our consolidated quarterly net revenues declined from a peak of million for the quarter ended september  to million for the quarter ended march   a decline of approximately 
the decrease we experienced in net revenues during this period was comparable to the peak to trough differences experienced by most of the companies in our industry 
intest corporation annual report on form k item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued during this downturn  the trend in both our bookings and net revenues was erratic 
our bookings and revenues began declining during the fourth quarter of and continued declining until the first quarter of  when our bookings increased sequentially for three quarters in the case of net revenues  this increase began in the second quarter of and lasted two quarters  followed by a decline again in bookings and net revenues in the fourth quarter of that continued until the second quarter of  when both bookings and net revenues began to increase sequentially again 
the current industry consensus is that the next up cycle began in and should continue for to months 
this view is supported by the increase in our quarterly bookings during  which increased from million in the first quarter to million in the fourth quarter 
this improvement is also shown in our quarterly net revenues  which increased from million in the first quarter of to million in the fourth quarter 
while we cannot be sure what the rate of increase of this up cycle will be or how long it will last  we currently expect the trend of growth in both bookings and net revenues to continue throughout  although the rate of quarter over quarter increases may decline 
we currently anticipate that our sales for the first quarter of will increase from the level of the fourth quarter of and be in the range of to million  however  cost containment initiatives during and  in response to the downturn  we implemented significant cost containment initiatives to reduce operating losses and preserve cash 
these cost containment initiatives included an approximate reduction in worldwide personnel  as well as temporary reductions in compensation for all employees and the elimination of matching contributions to retirement plans for all domestic employees 
in addition  we made significant reductions in spending on corporate travel  advertising  professional services and supplies 
as a result of these cost containment efforts  we reduced operating expenses from a peak of million for the quarter ended december  to million for the quarter ended march  during  we temporarily reinstated some of the benefits which had been reduced or eliminated after our bookings and net revenues began to increase 
however  when we began experiencing declines in our bookings  as well as customer order delays  during the second half of  both of which resulted in reduced net revenues during the fourth quarter of  we again temporarily eliminated certain employee benefits and instituted additional expense controls in certain facilities 
the goal of our cost containment initiatives was to reduce fixed operating costs to a level which  based on our then current revenue projections  would allow us to maintain our level of cash while still continuing our research and development programs and positioning ourselves such that  as the market improved  we would be able to be a prime supplier for both new and existing technologies developed by our customers 
as of december   all personnel worldwide remained on a salary freeze and matching contributions to retirement plans for all domestic employees were still temporarily eliminated 
given the improvements in our bookings and net revenues in the second half of  and in light of the industry consensus that the up cycle has begun and should continue through and into  we are monitoring our costs and evaluating when we will be able to return employee benefits as well as provide salary increases to personnel worldwide 
however  should the current upward trend reverse itself  or if our bookings and net revenues do not increase as currently projected  we are prepared to take appropriate actions necessary to preserve cash 
inventory obsolescence charges we review our inventories and record inventory obsolescence charges based upon our established obsolescence criteria  that identifies material that has not been used in a work order during the prior months and the excess quantity of material on hand that is greater than the average annual usage of that material over the prior three years or in the case of our temperature management systems  three years of average annual usage due to our after sale obligations for servicing these products 
in addition  in certain cases  additional inventory obsolescence charges are recorded based upon facts which would not give rise to an obsolescence charge under the normal obsolescence criteria or  if in management s opinion  additional amounts are felt to be necessary based upon the current industry conditions 
see also critical accounting policies 
the most recent downturn significantly reduced demand for a number of products we design and manufacture 
as a result  inventory obsolescence charges have historically increased during downturns and through the beginning of the subsequent upturn 
we incurred inventory obsolescence charges of  million and  million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
while the trend of these inventory obsolescence charges has been reducing over the last three years  we cannot determine if this downward trend will continue or if these charges will increase in due to potential technological obsolescence of our current inventories 
intest corporation annual report on form k item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued product warranty charges we accrue product warranty charges on a quarterly basis based upon our historical product warranty expense 
in addition  we accrue additional amounts based upon known product warranty issues  such as product retrofits 
our product warranty charges were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  and our product warranty charges as a percentage of net revenues were  and for the same periods  respectively 
the increase in both the absolute dollar amount of product warranty charges and the level of the product warranty charges as a percentage of net revenues was due to a number of factors including the volatility of net revenues in the ate industry  the prototype nature of much of our business  the introduction of products offering power assisted features in our positioner docking hardware segment and providing warranty repairs or replacements to customers after the warranty has expired in certain situations  in order to promote strong customer relations 
during  we accrued significant product warranty charges for future product retrofits for two products we sell to ate manufacturers 
in our positioner docking hardware segment  we accrued approximately  for retrofits to a positioner product developed and first sold during this power assisted positioner  whose prototype design was significantly different from the positioner products we have historically sold  had approximately units in the field that required several different modifications and enhancements 
in our temperature management segment  we accrued approximately  related to a temperature chuck product that was first introduced in this temperature chuck product was designed to allow for rapid temperature changes between and degrees celsius 
under certain environmental and usage conditions this product did not perform consistently  so we are replacing it in those cases with another of our products that is better suited for the conditions 
we believe we have accrued adequate warranty charges at december  for the product retrofits planned for both of these products 
we cannot determine at this time if we will have any further material warranty costs related to additional product modifications or enhancements for these or any of our other current products 
see also critical accounting policies 
customer mix we sell our products to both semiconductor manufacturers end user sales and to ate manufacturers oem sales who ultimately resell our equipment with theirs to semiconductor manufacturers 
the mix of customers during any given period will affect our gross margin due to differing sales discounts and commissions 
prior to  the majority of our positioner  docking hardware and tester interface product sales were made directly to semiconductor manufacturers  with sales to these end users typically in the range of to of our net revenues 
however  since the beginning of  many semiconductor manufacturers have shown a preference for purchasing from a single source the various components of the ate excluding temperature management systems that they need 
typically  this source is the tester manufacturer  who manufactures the largest and most expensive components of the ate system 
our oem sales as a percentage of net revenues for the years ended december   and were  and  respectively  for our positioner docking hardware segment 
the decline in the percentage of sales to oems in the positioner docking hardware segment in and reflects the return of demand by certain semiconductor customers who prefer to acquire their equipment directly from us 
we anticipate that oem sales as a percentage of net revenues for our positioner docking hardware segment will range from to in future periods 
in our tester interface segment  our oem sales as a percentage of net revenues for the years ended december   and were  and  respectively 
the increase in the percentage of sales to oems in the tester interface segment in reflects significantly increased demand by one oem customer in we anticipate that oem sales as a percentage of net revenues for our tester interface segment will range from to in future period s 
in our temperature management segment  oem sales as a percentage of net revenues were  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we anticipate that oem sales as a percentage of net revenues for our temperature management segment will range from to in future periods 
the impact of an increase in oem sales as a percentage of net revenues is a reduction in our gross margin  as oem sales historically have had a more significant discount than end user sales 
our current net operating margins on most oem sales for these product segments  however  are only slightly less than margins on end user sales because of the payment of third party sales commissions on most end user sales 
we also expect to continue to experience demands from our oem customers supply line management groups to reduce our sales prices to them 
this continued price pressure may have the ultimate effect of reducing our gross and operating margins if we cannot further reduce our manufacturing and operating costs 
intest corporation annual report on form k item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued we believe that purchases of most of our products are typically made from semiconductor manufacturers capital expenditure budgets 
certain portions of our business  however  are generally less dependent upon the capital expenditure budgets of the end users 
for example  purchases of certain related ate interface products  such as sockets and interface boards  which must be replaced periodically  are typically made from the end users operating budgets 
in addition  purchases of certain of our products  such as docking hardware  for the purpose of upgrading or to improve the utilization  performance and efficiency of existing ate  tend to be counter cyclical to sales of new ate 
moreover  we believe a portion of our sales of temperature management systems results from the increasing need for temperature testing of circuit boards and specialized components that do not have the design or quantity to be tested in an electronic device handler 
we believe that this business usually is less cyclical than new ate s ales 
however  during the recent downward cycle  we saw our customers orders for these types of products decline as much as  or in some cases more than  the other products we offer as compared with prior periods of reduced capital spending for ate 
we attribute this in part to reductions in our customers operating budgets combined with significant excess capacity that existed throughout the industry  which significantly reduced our customers equipment utilization rates 
we believe that much of this excess capacity was the result of capital equipment purchases made during the up cycle  and that this newer equipment did not need to be upgraded or improved 
we also believe that many of our customers equipment utilization rates have been steadily increasing throughout due to increased ic unit production and are approaching  or have already exceeded  the levels where additional ate equipment purchases will be necessary to meet increased ic production demands 
please refer to the section entitled risks that could affect future results below for a discussion of other important factors that could cause our results to differ materially from our prior results or those expressed or implied by our forward looking statements 
results of operations all of our products are used by semiconductor manufacturers in conjunction with ate in the testing of ics 
consequently  the results of operations for each product segment are generally affected by the same factors 
separate discussions and analyses for each product segment would be repetitive and obscure any unique factors that affected the results of operations of our different product segments 
the discussion and analysis that follows  therefore  is presented on a consolidated basis for the company as a whole and includes discussion of factors unique to each product segment where significant to an understanding of each such business 
the following table sets forth for the periods indicated the principal items included in the consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of total net revenues 
percentage of net revenues years ended december  net revenues cost of revenues gross margin selling expense engineering and product development expense general and administrative expense impairment of goodwill operating loss other income loss before income taxes income tax expense benefit net loss intest corporation annual report on form k item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenues 
net revenues were million for compared to million for  an increase of  or 
in  net revenues for our positioner docking hardware and tester interface segments increased million  or  and  or  respectively 
these increases were offset by a decrease in net revenues in our temperature management segment of  or 
we believe the increases in our positioner docking hardware and tester interface segments are due to the aforementioned increase in demand we experienced for our products throughout we believe that the decrease in net revenues for our temperature management segment reflects the severe cyclical downturn in demand for ate in the industry generally 
gross margin 
gross margin remained relatively unchanged in from the gross margin in was slightly over compared to slightly less than in the slight increase in gross margin in is primarily the result of a decrease in component material costs as a percentage of net revenues that reflects lower levels of fabrication costs due to process improvements as well as the mix of products sold and  to a lesser extent  a decrease in oem sales as a percentage of total sales in compared to  as previously discussed 
also  as previously discussed  we incurred significant charges for inventory obsolescence during both and as a result of the continued downturn in the industry 
selling expense 
selling expense was million for compared to million in  an increase of million or 
we attribute the increase primarily to the aforementioned increase in product warranty costs in our positioner docking hardware and temperature management segments 
other significant year over year increases included commission expense as well as salary and benefits expense 
the increase in commission expense of  was due to an increase in end user commissionable sales 
the increase in salary and benefit expense of  was due to the hiring of new sales staff in the positioner docking hardware and tester interface segments as well as the return of certain benefits that had previously been reduced or eliminated 
to a lesser extent  there were increases in travel expenses  freight costs and demonstration equipment  all of which were driven by the increased level of business activity as demand improved throughout engineering and product development expense 
engineering and product development expense was million for compared to million in  an increase of  or 
we attribute the increase primarily to an increase of  in salary and benefits expense in our positioner docking hardware and tester interface segments  where we increased our engineering and product development staff as well as returned certain benefits that had previously been reduced or eliminated 
also contributing to the increase were higher levels of spending on third party product development consultants and travel in our positioner docking hardware and temperature management segments 
the increases in staffing  third party consultant costs and travel were due to increased product development efforts throughout these increases were partially offset by reductions in spending on product development materials in our temperature management segment in compared to general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense was million for compared to million for  an increase of  or 
we attribute the increase primarily to increased data processing costs in our positioner docking hardware segment as well as increased salary and benefits expense in our positioner docking hardware and tester interface segments 
the  increase in data processing costs are related to a company wide erp system conversion that began in the fourth quarter of at our primary location in the positioner docking hardware segment and will continue into at our tester interface segment and into at the remaining locations in our positioner docking hardware segment 
the  increase in salary and benefits expense was the result of the return of certain benefits that had been reduced or eliminated 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in legal fees as well as reductions in spending on fees for tax services and comm unications 
the decrease in legal fees in compared to is primarily due to the settlement of patent litigation during the first quarter of other income 
other income was  for compared to  in  an increase of  or 
the increase in other income was primarily due to a decrease in foreign exchange transaction losses of  in compared to to a lesser extent  the increase was attributable to reduced interest expense in compared to partially offsetting the benefit of these two items was a reduction in interest income in compared to due to lower average cash balances 
income tax expense benefit 
income tax expense was million for compared to an income tax benefit of million for our effective tax rate for was compared to for during  we recorded a million valuation allowance against our beginning of the year net deferred tax assets due to our operating losses which intest corporation annual report on form k item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued resulted in the realizability of the net deferred tax assets to no longer be considered more likely than not 
in addition  we recorded approximately  of income tax expense in  due to the earnings of certain of our foreign operations as well as a reduction in the anticipated amount of tax refunds resulting from research and development credits filed for in during  we recorded a one time tax benefit of  which resulted from our filing amended prior year tax returns to claim additional research and experimentation credits for prior years 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenues 
net revenues were million for compared to million for  a decrease of million or 
net revenues for our temperature management segment decreased million or 
this decline was offset by increases in net revenues in both our positioner docking hardware and tester interface segments of  or and million or  respectively 
we believe that the significant decrease in net revenues for our temperature management segment reflected the severe cyclical downturn in demand for ate in the industry generally and  more specifically  the demand for products used in research and product development by semiconductor manufacturers declined in compared to we believe the increase in net revenues for our positioner docking hardware segment reflected the aforementioned increased demand we experienced for our products in the second and third quarters of  due to significant under spending in we believe the significant increase in the net revenues of our tester interface segment was primarily the result of the increased demand for our products in the second and third quarters of gross margin 
gross margin increased to in from in the increase in gross margin in is primarily the result of a decrease in component material costs as a percentage of net revenues which reflects lower levels of fabrication costs due to process improvements as well as the mix of products sold and  to a lesser extent  a decrease in oem sales as a percentage of total sales in compared to  as previously discussed 
significant charges for inventory obsolescence were recorded during both and as a result of the continued downturn in the industry which had caused items in our inventory to become obsolete 
selling expense 
selling expense was million for compared to million for  a decrease of  or 
we attribute the decrease primarily to decreased commission expense  which declined  due to the lower sales levels at our temperature management segment 
however  this trend was partially offset by a  increase in commission expense in our positioner docking hardware and tester interface product segments  where end user sales increased in compared to in addition  salary and benefit expenditures decreased  in as compared to  primarily as a result of our cost containment program 
engineering and product development expense 
engineering and product development expense was million for compared to million for  a decrease of  or 
we attribute the decrease primarily to a  decline in salary and benefit expense resulting from our cost containment program and  to a lesser extent  reduced expenditures for travel 
these declines were partially offset by increased spending on product development initiatives in compared to general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense was million for compared to million for  a decrease of million or 
we attribute the decrease primarily to the elimination of goodwill amortization of  in  reductions in salary and benefit expense of million and reductions of  in travel 
in addition  there were reductions in spending on professional services  outside directors fees and data processing 
the reduction in salary and benefits expense reflects the results of our cost containment program  combined with the fact that included an accrual for separation payments to a former executive of one of our subsidiaries 
the reductions in all other areas  with the exception of goodwill amortization  reflect the results of our cost containment program 
impairment of goodwill 
during the third quarter of  due to the significant decline in our operations that had occurred over the preceding four quarters  we determined that an assessment of our goodwill for impairment under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  was warranted 
as a result of this assessment  we concluded that no impairment was indicated for the goodwill associated with our foreign subsidiaries  however  a million impairment charge was recorded for the goodwill associated with testdesign  which was the net book value of this goodwill as of that date 
intest corporation annual report on form k item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which superceded the provisions of sfas no 
related to the assessment of goodwill for impairment 
sfas no 
was effective for us as of january  under sfas no 
 we are required to assess our goodwill for impairment at least annually  or more often if circumstances warrant 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 we completed the first step of the transitional goodwill impairment test as well as the annual goodwill impairment test and concluded that there was no further impairment of goodwill 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
other income 
other income was  for compared to  for  a decrease of  or 
the decline is primarily the result of reduced levels of interest income due to lower interest rates  an increase of  in foreign exchange translation losses and reductions in the level of third party royalty income from the licensing of our intellectual property caused by the continued industry downturn 
income tax benefit 
income tax benefit was million for compared to million for our effective tax rate for was compared to for during we recorded a one time tax benefit of approximately  this benefit resulted from our filing amended prior year returns to claim additional research and experimentation credits 
during we recorded a non tax deductible charge for the impairment of goodwill of million 
liquidity and capital resources net cash used in operations for the year ended december  was million compared to net cash provided by operations of million in the swing from cash provided by operations in to cash used in operations in was primarily the result of our operating losses in also contributing to this swing was the growth in accounts receivable and inventories 
accounts receivable increased million from december  to december  due to higher net revenue levels in the fourth quarter of compared to the same period in  while inventories increased  primarily due to the purchasing of materials to fulfill current and future orders 
refundable domestic income taxes decreased  primarily as the result of state and federal income tax refunds received during deferred tax assets decreased million  primarily as a result of recording a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
accounts payable increased million due to incr eased purchases to support higher production levels during the fourth quarter of compared to the same period in accrued expenses increased  primarily as a result of increased accruals for product warranty expense as previously discussed 
in addition  there were increases in accruals for wages and sales commissions 
purchases of property and equipment were million for the year ended december   which consisted of  primarily for demonstration equipment for our temptronic facility   primarily for computer hardware and software related to the implementation of a new erp system for our cherry hill facility and  primarily for demonstration equipment and equipment for our machine shop at our sunnyvale facility 
the balance of purchases were for equipment for our foreign subsidiaries 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was  which consisted of  in proceeds received from the exercise of employee stock options offset by  in payments made under capital lease obligations 
our total committed contracts that will affect cash over the next five years and beyond are as follows expected cash payments by year in thousands contractual commitments beyond total capital lease obligations operating lease obligations letters of credit committed capital expenditure projects intest corporation annual report on form k item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued we have a secured credit facility that provides for maximum borrowings of  we have not utilized this facility to borrow any funds 
our only usage consists of the issuance of a letter of credit in the face amount of  we pay a quarterly commitment fee of per annum on the unused portion of the facility  however  based upon current projected usage  we do not expect to pay a fee in the terms of the loan agreement require that we maintain a minimum level of  of domestic cash 
this credit facility expires on september  we currently plan to renew this facility at its current size to support the issuance of the letter of credit 
we do not currently foresee any reason that we will not be able to renew or replace this credit facility upon its expiration 
we believe that our existing cash balances plus the anticipated cash provided from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements for the foreseeable future 
as previously discussed  the current industry consensus is that an upturn has begun  and that the industry will sustain moderate quarter over quarter growth in bookings and net revenues throughout and into however  if the upturn were to be more rapid than we expect  or if the upturn should falter and the industry should enter another downturn  we may require additional debt or equity financing to meet working capital or capital expenditure needs 
we cannot be certain that  if needed  we would be able to raise such additional financing or upon what terms such financing would be available 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the securities and exchange commission the sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  effective december  sab no 
updates portions of the interpretive guidance included in topic of the codification of sabs to make this interpretive guidance consistent with current authoritative accounting guidance and sec rules and regulations related to revenue recognition 
we believe our revenue recognition policies are in compliance with sab no 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
addresses the accounting and reporting of expenses related to restructurings initiated after  and applies to costs associated with an exit activity including a restructuring or with a disposal of long lived assets 
those activities can include eliminating or reducing product lines  terminating employees and contracts  and relocating plant facilities or personnel 
sfas no 
changes some of the criteria for recognizing a liability for these activities 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have an effect on our results of operations  financial condition or long term liquidity 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
this statement amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the transition and annual disclosure provisions of sfas no 
are effective for fiscal years ending after december  effective january   we adopted the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
we have determined that we will not make the voluntarily change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation at this time 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
fin requires that the guarantor recognize  at the inception of certain guarantees  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing such guarantees 
fin also requires additional disclosure about the guarantor s obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions of this interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december   and the disclosure requirements are effective after december  the adoption of this interpretation did not have a material impact on our results of operations  financial condition or long term liability 
critical accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to inventories  identifiable intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill  deferred income tax valuation allowances and warranty reserves 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on appropriate and customary intest corporation annual report on form k item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
some of these accounting estimates and assumptions are particularly sensitive because of their significance to our consolidated financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting them may differ markedly from what had been assumed when the financial statements were prepared 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out basis or net realizable value 
we use consistent methodologies to evaluate all inventories for net realizable value 
we record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based upon our review process 
the criteria to determine if inventory is excess or obsolete are if the inventory was not utilized in a work order during the prior months or if the excess quantity of inventory on hand is greater than the average annual usage of that inventory or in the case of our temperature management systems  three years of average annual usage due to the after sale service requirements of these products 
in addition  operations and accounting staff review inventory that would not meet these criteria for excess or obsolescence to determine if additional obsolescence charges are necessary based upon assumptions about future demand  product mix and possible alternative uses 
finally  in certain cases  a subjective amount is recorded based upon either additional facts which would not give rise to an obsolescence charge under the initial obsolescence criteria or  if in management s opinion  additional amounts are felt to be necessary based upon the current industry conditions 
in  we recorded an inventory obsolescence charge for excess and obsolete inventory of  we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles and long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could indicate impairment include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the asset or the strategy for our overall business and significant negative industry or economic trends 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles and or long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we prepare projections of operations for our product segments where these intangibles and or long lived assets are associated 
if the carrying value of the intangible assets and or long lived assets exceeds the undiscounted cash flows per the projections  then we would record an impairment charge 
we measure the impairment based upon the projected discounted cash flows using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
when we determine that an impairment review is necessary for goodwill  we compare the fair value of our reporting units to their carrying values 
if the result from this analysis indicates that an impairment charge is required  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to its identifiable tangible and intangible assets  resulting in an implied valuation of goodwill associated with the reporting unit 
we would measure the impairment based on the difference between the implied valuation of the goodwill and its actual carrying value 
during  we did not record any impairment charges for identifiable intangibles  long lived assets or goodwill 
intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill were million at december  deferred tax assets are analyzed to determine if there will be sufficient taxable income in the future in order to realize such assets 
we assess all of the positive and negative evidence concerning the realizability of the deferred tax assets  including our historical results of operations for the recent past and our projections of future results of operations  in which we make subjective determinations of future events 
if  after assessing all of the evidence  both positive and negative  a determination is made that the realizability of the deferred tax assets is not more likely than not  we establish a deferred tax valuation allowance for all or a portion of the deferred tax assets depending upon the specific facts 
if any of the significant assumptions were changed  materially different results could occur  which could significantly change the amount of the deferred tax valuation allowance established 
during  we recorded a million valuation allowance against our beginning of year net deferred tax assets due to the cumulative losses we have generated during recent years 
finally  in connection with the accrual of warranty costs associated with our products  we make assumptions about the level of product failures that will occur in the future 
these assumptions are primarily based upon historical claims experience 
should the rate of future product failures significantly differ from historical levels  our accrued warranty reserves would need to be adjusted  and the amount of the adjustment could be material 
in  we recorded product warranty charges of million 
risks that could affect future results the factors discussed below are cautionary statements that identify important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by our forward looking statements 
these factors may also cause our future results to differ materially from our prior results 
intest corporation annual report on form k item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued our forward looking statements can often be identified by the use of forward looking terminology such as believes  expects  intends  may  will  should or anticipates or similar terminology  and include  but are not limited to  statements made in this report regarding the indicators of the reversal of the downturn in the ic and ate industries  developments and trends in the ic and ate industries  the possibility of future acquisitions  costs and timing of completion and integration of our acquisitions  our cost containment initiatives  the development of new products and technologies by us or our competitors  the availability of materials used to manufacture our products  the availability of qualified personnel  general economic conditions  net revenues generated by foreign subsidiaries  exchange rate fluctuations and the use of forward exchange rate contracts  the increasing use of front end testing by semiconductor manufacturers  stock price fluctuations  the anticipated market for our products  and the sufficiency of cash balances  lines of credit and net cash from operations 
our operating results and financial condition could continue to be negatively impacted if the semiconductor industry into which we sell our products remains depressed 
the recent downturn in the semiconductor and ate industries is the worst these industries have ever experienced 
this climate created significantly diminished demand for our products  excess manufacturing capacity in our plants  and the erosion of average selling prices 
while current industry forecasts suggest that the downturn in the semiconductor and ate industries may be reversing  we cannot be certain that such reversal will be prolonged or that it indicates the beginning of an up cycle 
any further decline in our customers markets or in general economic conditions would likely result in a further reduction in demand for our products and could harm our consolidated financial position  results of operations  cash flows and stock price 
an up cycle that is more rapid than we expect may require additional debt or equity financing to meet working capital requirements or capital expenditure needs 
we cannot be sure that such financing will be available when required or on acceptable terms 
our sales reflect the cyclicality of the semiconductor industry  which causes our operating results to fluctuate significantly 
our business depends in significant part upon the capital expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers 
capital expenditures by these companies depend upon  among other things  the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductors and the products that utilize them 
typically  semiconductor manufacturers curtail capital expenditures during periods of economic downtown 
conversely  semiconductor manufacturers increase capital expenditures when market demand requires the addition of new or expanded production capabilities or the reconfiguration of existing fabrication facilities to accommodate new products 
these market changes have contributed in the past  and will likely continue to contribute in the future  to fluctuations in our operating results 
our operating results often change significantly from quarter to quarter and may cause fluctuations in our stock price 
during the last three years  our operating results have fluctuated significantly from quarter to quarter 
we believe that these fluctuations occur primarily due to the cycles of demand in the semiconductor manufacturing industry 
in addition to the changing cycles of demand in the semiconductor manufacturing industry  other factors that have caused our quarterly operating results to fluctuate in the past  and that may cause fluctuations or losses in the future  include intest corporation annual report on form k item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the technological obsolescence of our inventories  quantities of our inventories greater than is reasonably likely to be utilized in future periods  significant product warranty charges  the recording of valuation allowances against deferred tax assets  competitive pricing pressures  the impairment of our assets due to reduced future demand for our products  our ability to control operating costs  delays in shipments of our products  the mix of our products sold  the mix of customers and geographic regions where we sell our products  changes in the level of our fixed costs  costs associated with the development of our proprietary technology  costs and timing of integration of our acquisitions and plant relocations and expansions  our ability to obtain raw materials or fabricated parts when needed  and cancellation or rescheduling of orders by our customers 
because the market price of our common stock has tended to vary based on  and in relation to  changes in our operating results  fluctuations in the market price of our stock are likely to continue as variations in our quarterly results continue 
if we are not able to control our operating expenses during a cyclical downturn  or if an upturn is more rapid than we anticipate  we may not have sufficient cash to operate our businesses 
during the recent cyclical downturn  we implemented cost containment strategies with a goal of reducing our operating expenses and preserving our cash 
these strategies included workforce reductions at all of our facilities worldwide  salary reductions for all employees worldwide  a temporary elimination of domestic retirement benefits and additional cost controls on other expenditures 
if the downturn continues and we are not able to control our operating expenses  they could increase and the level of our cash may not be sufficient to operate our businesses 
conversely  if the downturn has ended and a strong upturn ensues  we may need additional cash to finance our working capital needs or for capital expenditures 
we cannot determine with certainty that  if needed  we would be able to raise additional funding through either equity or debt financing 
we intend to acquire additional businesses 
if we are unable to do so  our future rate of growth may be reduced or limited 
a key element of our growth strategy is to acquire businesses  technologies or products that expand and complement our current businesses 
we may not be able to execute our acquisition strategy if we are unable to identify suitable businesses or technologies to acquire  we do not have access to required capital at the necessary time  or we are unwilling or unable to outbid larger  more resourceful companies 
our acquisition strategy involves financial and management risks which may adversely affect our earnings in the future 
if we acquire additional businesses  technologies or products  we will face the following additional risks future acquisitions could divert management s attention from daily operations or otherwise require additional management  operational and financial resources  intest corporation annual report on form k item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued we might not be able to integrate future acquisitions into our business successfully or operate acquired businesses profitably  we may realize substantial acquisition related expenses which would reduce our net earnings in future years  and our investigation of potential acquisition candidates may not reveal problems and liabilities of the companies that we acquire 
if any of the events described above occur  our earnings could be reduced 
if we issue shares of our stock or other rights to purchase our stock in connection with any future acquisitions  we would dilute our existing stockholders interests and our earnings per share may decrease 
if we issue debt in connection with any future acquisitions  lenders may impose covenants on use which could  among other things  restrict our ability to increase capital expenditures or to acquire additional businesses 
our industry is subject to rapidly evolving technological change  and our business prospects would be negatively affected if we are unable to respond to innovation in the semiconductor industry 
semiconductor technology continues to become more complex as manufacturers incorporate ics into an increasing variety of products 
this trend  and the rapid changes needed in automatic testing systems to respond to developments in the semiconductor industry  are likely to continue 
we cannot be certain that we will be successful in developing  manufacturing or selling products that will satisfy customer needs or attain market acceptance 
our failure to provide products that meet customer needs or gain market acceptance will negatively affect our business prospects 
if we are not able to obtain patents on or otherwise preserve and protect our proprietary technologies  our business may suffer 
we have obtained domestic and foreign patents covering some of our products which expire between the years and  and we have pending applications for additional patents 
some of our products utilize proprietary technology that is not covered by a patent or similar protection  and in many cases  cannot be protected 
we cannot be certain that any additional patents will be issued on our applications  any patents we own now or in the future will protect our business against competitors that develop similar technology or products  our patents will be held valid if they are challenged or subjected to reexamination or reissue  others will not claim rights to our patented or other proprietary technologies  or others will not develop technologies which are similar to  or can compete with  our unpatented proprietary technologies 
if we cannot obtain patent or other protection for our proprietary technologies  our ability to compete in our markets could be impaired 
claims of intellectual property infringement by or against us could seriously harm our businesses 
from time to time  we may be forced to respond to or prosecute intellectual property infringement claims to defend or protect our rights or a customer s rights 
these claims  regardless of merit  may consume valuable management time  result in costly litigation or cause product shipment delays 
any of these factors could seriously harm our business and operating results 
we may have to enter into royalty or licensing agreements with third parties who claim infringement 
these royalty or licensing agreements  if available  may be costly to us 
if we are unable to enter into royalty or licensing agreements with satisfactory terms  our business could suffer 
in instances where we have had reason to believe that we may be infringing the patent rights of others  or that someone may be infringing our patent rights  we have asked our patent counsel to evaluate the validity of the patents in question  as well as the potentially infringing conduct 
if we become involved in a dispute  neither the third parties nor the courts are bound by our counsel s conclusions 
intest corporation annual report on form k item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued our business will suffer if we cannot compete successfully with manufacturers whose products are similar to ours 
we compete with numerous manufacturers  many of whom have greater financial resources and more extensive design and production capabilities than we do 
some of our principal competitors in the sale of manipulator  docking and tester interface products are reid ashman manufacturing  microhandling gmbh  esmo ag  credence systems  ltx  teradyne and cerprobe 
some of our principal competitors in the sale of temperature management products are trio tech international  thermonics and ers elektronik gmbh 
in order to remain competitive with these and other companies  we must be able to continue to commit a significant portion of our personnel  financial resources  research and development and customer support to developing new products and maintaining customer satisfaction worldwide 
if we are not able to compete successfully  our business will suffer 
we generate a large portion of our sales from a small number of customers 
if we were to lose one or more of our large customers  operating results could suffer dramatically 
agilent technologies and texas instruments accounted for and  respectively  of our net revenues in our ten largest customers accounted for approximately of our net revenues in the loss of any one or more of our largest customers  or a reduction in orders by a major customer  could materially reduce our net revenues 
if we do not continue to retain the services of key personnel  relationships with  and sales to  some of our customers could suffer 
the loss of key personnel could adversely affect our ability to manage our business effectively 
our future success will depend largely upon the continued services of our senior management and certain other key employees 
we do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers or other key employees 
our future success will depend  in part  upon our ability to retain our managers  engineers and other key employees 
our business could suffer if we were unable to retain one or more of our senior officers or other key employees 
a substantial portion of our operations exists outside the us  which exposes us to foreign political and economic risks 
we have operated internationally for many years and expect to expand our international operations as necessary to continue expansion of our sales and service to our non us customers 
our foreign subsidiaries generated and of consolidated net revenues in and  respectively 
export sales from our us manufacturing facilities totaled million  or of consolidated net revenues  in and million  or of consolidated net revenues  in the portion of our consolidated net revenues that were derived from sales by our subsidiaries in the asia pacific region was in and in we expect our international revenues will continue to represent a significant portion of total net revenues 
to date  we have not experienced significant problems in our foreign operations 
however  in addition to the risks generally associated with sales and operations in the us  sales to customers outside the us and operations in foreign countries are subject to additional risks  whic h may  in the future  affect our operations 
these risks include political and economic instability in foreign countries  the imposition of financial and operational controls and regulatory restrictions by foreign governments  the need to comply with a wide variety of us and foreign import and export laws  trade restrictions  changes in tariffs and taxes  longer payment cycles  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  and the greater difficulty of administering business abroad 
intest corporation annual report on form k item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued we conduct business in foreign currencies  and fluctuations in the values of those currencies could result in foreign exchange losses 
in  approximately of our net revenues were denominated in japanese yen  approximately were dominated in british pounds  and approximately were dominated in euros 
fluctuations in the values of these currencies could result in foreign exchange losses 
any strengthening of the us dollar in relation to the currencies of our competitors or customers  or strengthening or weakening of the japanese yen  british pound or euro in relation to other currencies in which our customers or competitors do business  could adversely affect our competitiveness 
moreover  a strengthening of the us dollar or other competitive factors could put pressure on us to denominate a greater portion of our sales in foreign currencies  thereby increasing our exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates 
any devaluation of these currencies would hurt our business 
we do not undertake hedging activities against all of our exchange rate risk 
fluctuations in exchange rates may adversely affect our competitive position or resul t in foreign exchange losses  either of which could cause our business to suffer 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk exchange rate risk management we are exposed to currency exchange rate risk in the normal course of our business  primarily in our foreign operations 
our exposure results from the fact that some or all of the product sales at these operations are in one currency and inventory purchases are in another currency 
in our uk operation  approximately of our sales are in us dollars or euros and the corresponding inventory purchases to support these sales are in british pounds 
in our singapore operation  of our sales are in us dollars but some of our manufacturing costs are in british pounds and singapore dollars 
in our japanese operation  of our sales are in japanese yen and inventory purchases are in us dollars 
in one of our german operations  our sales are in euros while inventory purchases are in us dollars 
in our other german operation  a portion of our sales are occasionally in us dollars but all of our manufacturing costs are in euros 
from time to time we employ risk management strategies  including the use o f forward exchange rate contracts  to manage our exposure to exchange rate risks involving the yen  and may  in the future  use forward exchange rate contracts to manage our exposure to exchange rate risks involving the british pound  the singapore dollar or the euro 
our objective in managing currency exchange risk is to minimize the impact of significant currency exchange rate fluctuations 
we use forward exchange rate contracts to establish a fixed conversion rate between the japanese yen and the us dollar so that the level of our gross margin from sales in japan is not negatively affected by significant movements in the japanese yen to us dollar exchange rate 
we purchase forward exchange rate contracts on a monthly basis in the amounts management deems appropriate in light of the amount of the us dollar denominated obligations of our japanese subsidiary that are due within the month 
we do not purchase forward contracts with settlement dates beyond days 
as of december   there were no forward exchange rate contracts outstanding 
it is our policy to enter into forward exchange rate contracts only to the extent necessary to achieve the desired objectives of management in limiting our exposure to significant fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
we do not hedge all of our currency exchange rate risk exposures in a manner that would completely eliminate the impact of changes in currency exchange rates on our net earnings 
we do not expect that the results of our operations or our liquidity will be materially affected by these risk management activities 
interest rate risk management as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million 
we generally place our investments in us treasury obligations or money market funds backed by such investments 
we have not held and do not hold any derivatives related to our interest rate exposure 
due to the average maturity and conservative nature of our investment portfolio  a sudden change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the value of the portfolio 
management estimates that had the average yield of our investments decreased by basis points  our interest income for year ended december  would have decreased by less than  this estimate assumes that the decrease occurred on the first day of and reduced the yield of each investment by basis points 
the impact on our future interest income of future changes in investment yields will depend largely on the gross amount of our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments
