item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion compares the financial condition of the company at december  to the financial condition at december  and the results of operations for the years ended december    and this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
performance overview the company recorded an increase in net income for over net income for the year ended december  was  compared to  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
basic net income per share for was  an increase of over basic net income per share was and for and  respectively 
diluted net income per share was  an increase of over diluted net income per share was and for and  respectively 
return on average assets was for  compared to for and return on stockholders equity for was compared to for and for average assets increased totaling  average loans increased totaling  average deposits increased totaling  and average stockholders equity increased totaling  for the year ended december   when compared to recent developments as previously disclosed in documents filed with the sec  the company executed a definitive merger agreement with midstate bancorp on november  this merger is subject to regulatory approval  the satisfaction of various conditions set forth in the merger agreement  and the approval of the stockholders of midstate bancorp  the meeting for which is scheduled to be held on march  there is no guarantee that the merger will be approved or consummated 
if the merger is consummated  the company will acquire felton bank  which will operate as an independent bank subsidiary of the company 
felton bank s integration into the company  and its future growth and profitability  will likely impact the company s growth and profitability 
the regulations of the frb require the depository institutions owned by a financial holding company to be and remain  among other things  well managed 
a financial holding company that fails to meet this requirement is prohibited from engaging in any further financial activities without prior approval and must enter into an agreement with the frb to address compliance 
during this corrective period  the frb may impose any conditions and restrictions on the business of the financial holding company that it deems appropriate 
if the financial holding company is unable to comply with the well managed requirement within days after falling out of compliance  then it may be required to divest its interest in one or more of its depository institutions 
as of the date of this report  felton bank does not meet this requirement 
management is working with the frb to address felton bank s management deficiencies after the proposed merger 
although management believes that it will correct the deficiencies within days after the effective date of the proposed merger  there can be no guarantee that it will meet this timeline 
if the company is not able to correct the deficiency within days after the proposed merger  then the financial activities of its subsidiaries  including insurance producer activities  may be restricted or prohibited and the company may be required to either divest itself of felton bank  merge felton bank into one of its other depository institutions  or otherwise restructure its operations 
it is not possible to predict the impact that any of these steps would have on the business  financial performance  or profitability of the company and its subsidiaries 
critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and follow general practices within the industries in which it operates 
application of these principles requires management to make estimates  assumptions  and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates  assumptions  and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements  accordingly  as this information changes  the financial statements could reflect different estimates  assumptions  and judgments 
certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates  assumptions  and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
estimates  assumptions  and judgments are necessary when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value  when a decline in the value of an asset not carried on the financial statements at fair value warrants an impairment write down or valuation reserve to be established  or when an asset or liability needs to be recorded contingent upon a future event 
carrying assets and liabilities at fair value inherently results in more financial statement volatility 
the fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based either on quoted market prices or are provided by other third party sources  when available 
the most significant accounting policies followed by the company are presented in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
these policies  along with the disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes and in this financial review  provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined 
based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods  assumptions  and estimates underlying those amounts  management has identified the determination of the allowance for credit losses to be the accounting area that requires the most subjective or complex judgments  and as such could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available 
the allowance for credit losses represents management s estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date 
determining the amount of the allowance for credit losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience  and consideration of current economic trends and conditions  all of which may be susceptible to significant change 
the loan portfolio also represents the largest asset type on the consolidated balance sheets 
note of the notes to consolidated financial statements describes the methodology used to determine the allowance for credit losses and a discussion of the factors driving changes in the amount of the allowance for credit losses is included in the credit risk management section of this financial review 
recent accounting pronouncements and developments note of the notes to consolidated financial statements discusses new accounting policies adopted by the company during and the expected impact of accounting policies recently issued or proposed but not yet required to be adopted 
to the extent the adoption of new accounting standards materially affects the company s financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity  the impacts are discussed in the applicable section s of this financial review and notes to the consolidated financial statements 
results of operations net interest income and net interest margin net interest income remains the most significant component of the company s earnings 
it is the excess of interest and fees earned on loans  federal funds sold  and investment securities  over interest paid on deposits and borrowings

provision for credit losses and risk management originating loans involves a degree of risk that credit losses will occur in varying amounts according to  among other factors  the types of loans being made  the credit worthiness of the borrowers over the term of the loans  the quality of the collateral for the loan  if any  as well as general economic conditions 
the company s board of directors demands accountability of management  keeping the interests of stockholders in focus 
through its asset liability and audit committees  the board actively reviews critical risk positions  including market  credit  liquidity and operational risk 
the company s goal in managing risk is to reduce earnings volatility  control exposure to unnecessary risk  and ensure appropriate returns for risk assumed 
senior members of management actively manage risk at the product level  supplemented with corporate level oversight through the asset liability committee and internal audit function 
the risk management structure is designed to identify risk issues through a systematic process  enabling timely and appropriate action to avoid and mitigate risk 
credit risk management the company s loan portfolio is subject to varying degrees of credit risk 
credit risk is mitigated through portfolio diversification  limiting exposure to any single industry or customer  collateral protection and standard lending policies and underwriting criteria 
the following discussion provides information and statistics on the overall quality of the company s loan portfolio 
note of the notes to consolidated financial statements describes the accounting policies related to nonperforming loans and charge offs and describes the methodologies used to develop the allowance for credit losses  including both the specific and nonspecific components 
management believes the policies governing nonperforming loans and charge offs are consistent with regulatory standards 
the amount of the allowance for credit losses and the resulting provision are reviewed monthly by senior members of management and approved quarterly by the board of directors 
the allowance is increased by provisions for credit losses charged to expense and recoveries of loans previously charged off 
it is decreased by loans charged off in the current period 
provisions for credit losses are made to bring the allowance for credit losses within the range of balances that are considered appropriate based upon the allowance methodology and to reflect losses within the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date 
the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is determined based upon management s estimate of the inherent risks associated with lending activities  estimated fair value of collateral  past experience and present indicators such as loan delinquency trends  nonaccrual loans and current market conditions 
management believes the allowance is adequate  however  future changes in the composition of the loan portfolio and financial condition of borrowers may result in additions to the allowance 
examination of the portfolio and allowance by various regulatory agencies and consultants engaged by the company may result in the need for additional provisions based upon information available at the time of the examination 
each of the banks maintains a separate allowance for credit losses  which is only available to absorb losses from their respective loan portfolios 
each banks allowance is subject to regulatory examination and determination as to its adequacy 
the allowance for credit losses is comprised of two parts the specific allowance and the formula allowance 
the specific allowance is the portion of the allowance that results from management s evaluation of specific loss allocations for identified problem loans and pooled reserves based on historical loss experience for each loan category 
the formula allowance is determined based on management s assessment of industry trends and economic factors in the markets in which the company operates 
the determination of the formula allowance involves a higher risk of uncertainty and considers current risk factors that may not have yet manifested themselves in the company s historical loss factors 
the specific allowance is based on each banks quarterly analysis of its loan portfolio and is determined based upon the analysis of collateral values  cash flows and guarantor s financial capacity  whichever are applicable 
in addition  allowance factors are applied to internally classified loans for which specific allowances have not been determined and historical loss factors are applied to homogenous pools of unclassified loans 
historical loss factors may be adjusted by management in situations where no historical losses have occurred or where current conditions are not reflective of the specific history of the company 
the formula allowance is based upon management s evaluation of external conditions  the effects of which are not directly measured in the determination of the specific allowance 
the conditions evaluated in connection with the formula allowance include general economic and business conditions affecting the company s primary lending area  credit quality trends  collateral values  loan values  loan volumes and concentrations  seasoning of the loan portfolio  specific industry conditions within the portfolio segments  recent loss experience  duration of the current business cycle  bank regulatory examination results  and findings of internal loan review personnel 
management reviews the conditions which impact the formula allowance quarterly and to the extent any of these conditions relate to specifically identifiable loans may reflect the adjustment in the specific allowance 
where any of these conditions is not related to a specific loan or loan category  management s evaluation of the probable loss related to the condition is reflected in the formula allowance 
while the local economy does not seem to be showing signs of weakness or the effect of the recent recession exhibited elsewhere in the nation  management is aware that the effects of continued weakness in the national economy could result in future higher loss levels for the company 
the ratio of net charge offs to average loans was 
in  compared to 
in at december   the allowance for credit losses was  or 
of average outstanding loans  and of total nonaccrual loans 
this compares to an allowance of  or 
of average outstanding loans and of nonaccrual loans  at december   and an allowance for credit losses of  or of outstanding loans and of nonaccrual loans  at december  management s decision regarding the amount of the provision is influenced in part by growth in commercial and real estate loan balances

during there was no change in the methods or assumptions affecting the allowance methodology 
the provision for credit losses was  for the year compared to  for the amount of the provision is determined based upon management s analysis of the portfolio  growth and changes in the condition of credits and their resultant specific loss allocations 
improvements in the condition of several large commercial credits resulted in a decline in the allowance requirement attributable to those types of loans 
in addition  previously identified losses on other commercial loans were recognized during growth in loans secured by real estate required an increased allocation of the reserve and offset the improved credit quality experienced in other categories of loans 
net charge offs declined as a result of increased recoveries during compared to net charge offs were  compared to  for and  respectively 
the allowance decreased  or during  totaling  or

the unallocated portion of the allowance at december  and was and of the total allowance  respectively 
the allowance pertaining to commercial  financial and agricultural loans represented of the total allowance at december   compared to at december  the decline is attributable in part to the improved condition of several large commercial customers  the recognition of previously identified losses  and better overall underwriting practices 
the amount of the reserve allocated to real estate mortgage loans increased from at december  to at december  as the result of continued growth in the real estate mortgage portfolio and the identification of increased specific loss allocations 
the company s loans are primarily made in kent  queen anne s  talbot  caroline and dorchester counties on maryland s eastern shore 
real estate mortgage loans represented of the portfolio at december   compared to at december  the company has experienced low loss levels with respect to these loans as a result of its substantial experience in the markets it serves as well as its conservative lending practices

these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit 
the company s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to these financial instruments is represented by the contractual amount of the instruments 
the company uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on balance sheet instruments 
the company generally requires collateral or other security to support the financial instruments with credit risk 
the amount of collateral or other security is determined based on management s credit evaluation of the counterparty 
the company evaluates each customer s creditworthiness on a case by case basis 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
letters of credit and other commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
since many of the letters of credit and commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
for further information about these arrangements  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
liquidity management liquidity describes the ability of the company to meet financial obligations that arise during the normal course of business 
liquidity is primarily needed to meet the borrowing and deposit withdrawal requirements of customers and to fund current and planned expenditures 
liquidity is derived through increased customer deposits  maturities in the investment portfolio  loan repayments and income from earning assets 
to the extent that deposits are not adequate to fund customer loan demand  liquidity needs can be met in the short term funds markets 
the company has arrangements with correspondent banks whereby it has  available in federal funds lines of credit and a reverse repurchase agreement available to meet any short term needs which may not otherwise be funded by its portfolio of readily marketable investments that can be converted to cash 
the banks are also members of the federal home loan bank of atlanta  which provides another source of liquidity 
at december   the company s loan to deposit ratio was  which was approximately the same as one year ago 
investment securities available for sale totaling  were available for the management of liquidity and interest rate risk 
cash and cash equivalents were  at december    less than one year ago 
management is not aware of any demands  commitments  events or uncertainties that will materially affect the company s ability to maintain liquidity at satisfactory levels 
the company has various financial obligations  including contractual obligations and commitments  that may require future cash payments 
the following table presents  as of december   significant fixed and determinable contractual obligations to third parties by payment date 
dollars in thousands within one year one to three years three to five years over five years deposits without a stated maturity a  certificates of deposit a    short term borrowings  long term debt  operating leases purchase obligations contingent earn out payments  a includes accrued interest payable market risk management market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments due to changes in interest rates  exchange rates or equity pricing 
the company s principal market risk is interest rate risk that arises from its lending  investing and deposit taking activities 
the company s profitability is dependent on the banks net interest income 
interest rate risk can significantly affect net interest income to the degree that interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice at different intervals than interest earning assets 
the banks asset liability committees oversee the management of interest rate risk 
the primary purpose of these committees is to manage the exposure of net interest margins to unexpected changes due to interest rate fluctuations 
these efforts affect the loan pricing and deposit rate policies of the company as well as the asset mix  volume guidelines  and liquidity and capital planning 
the company does not utilize derivative financial or commodity instruments or hedging strategies in its management of interest rate risk 
since the company is not exposed to market risk from trading activities and does not utilize hedging strategies or off balance sheet management strategies  the asset liability committees of the banks rely on gap analysis as its primary tool in managing interest rate risk 
gap analysis summarizes the amount of interest sensitive assets and liabilities  which will reprice over various time intervals 
the difference between the volume of assets and liabilities repricing in each interval is the interest sensitivity gap 
positive gap occurs when more assets reprice in a given time interval  while negative gap occurs when more liabilities reprice 
as of december   the company had a negative gap position within the one year repricing interval 
rates paid for interest bearing liabilities are approaching their theoretical floors with very little room left for reductions in the rates being paid to depositors
