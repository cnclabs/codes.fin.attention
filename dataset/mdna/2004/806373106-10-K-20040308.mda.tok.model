executive level overview the company s revenues are driven by changes to consumer product packaging designs and promotions and advertising spending 
of the company s business is graphic services for consumer product packaging applications 
generally  a package design changes every three or four years 
between changes  there are line extensions and promotions that take advantage of popular brand images in a variety of products 
however  because the company cannot predict when a design will change or when a promotion will occur  backlog does not exist 
there are regular promotions throughout the year that create revenue opportunities for the company  for example valentine s day  easter  fourth of july  back to school  halloween  thanksgiving and christmas 
in addition  there are event driven promotions that occur regularly  such as the super bowl  grammy awards  world series  indianapolis and the olympics 
lastly  there are a number of health related banners that are added to food and beverage packaging  such as heart healthy  low in carbohydrates  enriched with essential vitamins  low in saturated fat and caffeine free 
all of these items require new product packaging designs or changes in existing designs and create revenue for the company 
in simple terms  change equals revenue

conversely  selling  general and administrative costs were up as the company increased management staffing in asia to prepare for increased business levels and added personnel in the united states to manage the new business won by the company in the second half of this increase was partially offset by the absence of the special charges 
further contributing to the growth in net income were lower interest costs and a number of non recurring items of other income

however  the company s advertising agency business was down percent for the full year due to decreased advertising agency spending

income tax provision for the year ended december   was at an effective rate of percent

on january   the company adopted sfas  the accounting pronouncement on goodwill accounting 
previously  the company recorded monthly amortization of goodwill  generally over a year period 
the rules that became effective january  prohibit the amortization of goodwill 
rather  goodwill is to be reviewed on a periodic basis  and if a write down is required  the write down must be taken at that time  similar to an impairment charge on other long lived assets

however  lower sales in the graphics for advertising agency business more than offset the gains from the consumer products packaging business 
the lower sales level in the advertising agency business was due to the continuing weakness in the advertising market 
gross margin as a percentage of net sales for increased to from for the prior year 
given the fact that net sales were lower than the prior period  an increase in gross margin as a percentage of sales is a positive result 
the increase in gross margin as a percentage of sales indicates that the cost cutting moves the company initiated through its restructurings is having a positive effect 
operating income in was higher than the previous year despite million of asset impairment and severance charges classified as restructuring and other charges on the consolidated statement of operations as compared to million of restructuring charges in the increase in operating income was attributable to cost reduction efforts and restructuring efforts completed in prior years and the nonamortization of goodwill due to the change in accounting method 
restructuring and other charges of million in resulted from million of charges for asset impairment recorded in accordance with the new accounting standard for asset impairments  statement of financial accounting standard no

the company continues to evaluate its operations for possible changes including consolidation of certain locations and changing the staffing levels of other operations to reflect the volume of business being serviced by such locations 
other income expense net decreased in to expense of million compared with expense of million in the lower net expense was primarily as a result of lower interest expense 
the decrease in interest expense was from a combination of lower interest rates and lower borrowing levels in as compared to the prior year 
the lower borrowing levels were due to strong cash flows from operations that were utilized  in part  to pay down debt 
interest expense also benefited from lower rates in versus income tax provision as a percentage of pretax income was lower than the previous year as a result of offsetting the regular tax provision with tax benefits from state tax refunds received in the second quarter of and tax benefits from the reduction in tax liabilities in connection with the settlement of an outstanding liability for lower amount than the amount that had been accrued

critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that effect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that our critical accounting policies are limited to those described below 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
accounts receivable 
the company s clients are primarily consumer product manufacturers  converters and advertising agencies  none of which individually represent more than of total revenue 
accounts receivable consist primarily of amounts due to us from our normal business activities 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect the expected losses of accounts receivable based on past collection history and specific risks identified in the portfolio 
impairment of long lived assets 
we record impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of those items 
our cash flow estimates are based on historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and operating conditions 
the net carrying value of assets not recoverable is reduced to fair value 
our estimates of fair value represent our best estimate based on industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions 
goodwill and other acquired intangible assets 
the company has made acquisitions in the past that included a significant amount of goodwill and other intangible assets 
under generally accepted accounting principles in effect through december   these assets were amortized over their estimated useful lives  and were tested periodically to determine if they were recoverable from operating earnings on an undiscounted basis over their useful lives 
effective in  goodwill is no longer amortized but is subject to an annual or under certain circumstances more frequent impairment test based on its estimated fair value 
other intangible assets that meet certain criteria continue to be amortized over their useful lives and are also subject to an impairment test based on estimated undiscounted cash flows 
there are many assumptions and estimates underlying the determination of an impairment loss 
another estimate using different  but still reasonable  assumptions could produce a significantly different result 
therefore  impairment losses could be recorded in the future 
the company adopted the new rules on accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets effective january  application of the non amortization provision resulted in an increase in net income of approximately million per share 
the company performed the required impairment test of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets in and it was determined appropriate to consider the company to be one reporting unit for purposes of this test 
impact of inflation the company believes that over the past three years inflation has not had a significant impact on the company s results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate exposure the company has no variable rate debt outstanding at december   but expects to use its variable rate credit facilities to fund cash flow needs during and beyond 
assuming interest rate volatility in the future similar to what has been seen in recent years  the company does not anticipate that short term changes in interest rates will materially affect its consolidated financial position  results of operation  or cash flows 
foreign exchange exposure the company has foreign operations that expose it to translation risk when the local currency financial statements are translated to us dollars 
since changes in translation risk are reported as adjustments to stockholders equity  a change in the foreign exchange rate would not have material effect on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows
