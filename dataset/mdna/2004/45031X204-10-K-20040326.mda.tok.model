table of contents the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements filed as part of this form k 
overview we are an emerging specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of unique and uniquely improved products for serious diseases and conditions of the eye 
since our inception  we have devoted our resources primarily to fund research and development programs and late stage product acquisitions 
in december  we announced our strategic plan to transition from a development stage organization to a specialty pharmaceutical company with a primary focus on ophthalmology 
in order to advance our strategic plan  we are pursuing the development of several products  including vitrase ovine hyaluronidase and istalol timolol  which are in the later stages of review by the fda 
there can be no assurances that either vitrase or istalol will receive final fda approval 
even if we receive fda approval of the vitrase nda for use as a spreading agent  the launch of the product may require fda approval of supplemental filings related to product packaging and labeling and  in certain circumstances  the approval of allergan 
nevertheless  we are currently undertaking significant preparations for expansion of our manufacturing and marketing capabilities in the event such approvals are obtained 
if approved by the fda  vitrase and istalol will be manufactured for us through our contract manufacturers 
in the united states the marketing of istalol will be done by us and marketing for vitrase  for uses in the posterior region of the eye  will be done by allergan  inc we currently have no approved products 
we are seeking fda approval for vitrase  a proprietary drug that we are developing for the treatment of vitreous hemorrhage  for use as a spreading agent to facilitate the absorption and dispersion of other injected drugs  and for the treatment of diabetic retinopathy 
we are also pursuing market approval in the united states of istalol  our new formulation of timolol  to treat glaucoma 
in december  we completed enrollment of our phase iii clinical studies in the united states for xibrom bromfenac  a topical non steroidal anti inflammatory compound for the treatment of ocular inflammation and announced the initial results of our clinical studies in march finally  we are currently conducting feasibility studies for the reformulation and commercialization of caprogel aminocaproic acid  a topical formulation aminocaproic acid for the treatment of hyphema 
we believe that if vitrase  istalol  and our other ophthalmic product candidates obtain regulatory approval and are commercially successful  we will advance our strategic plan to build a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on serious diseases and conditions of the eye 
we currently have no products available for sale and have not generated any revenues from sales of our products 
we have incurred losses since inception and had an accumulated deficit of million through december  our losses have resulted primarily from research and development activities  including clinical trials  related general and administrative expenses and a deemed dividend to our preferred shareholders 
we expect to continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future as we continue to conduct research  development and clinical testing activities  and to seek regulatory approval for our product candidates and to develop our marketing  sales  distribution and other commercial and management capacities in anticipation of the approval of one or more of our product candidates 
results of operations the following discussion of our results of operations generally reflects our continuing transition from a development stage company to a specialty pharmaceuticals company with a primary focus on ophthalmology 
years ended december   and revenue 
revenue of  for and reflects the amortization for the period of deferred revenue recorded in december for the license fee payment made by otsuka pharmaceuticals for commercialization rights to vitrase in japan for ophthalmic uses in the posterior regions of the eye 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were million in  million in and million in our research and development expenses to date have consisted primarily 
table of contents of costs associated with the clinical trials of our product candidates  compensation and other expenses for research and development personnel  costs for consultants and contract research organizations and costs related to the development of commercial scale manufacturing capabilities for vitrase  istalol and xibrom 
we generally classify and separate research and development expenditures into amounts related to preclinical research  clinical development and manufacturing development 
we have not tracked our historical research and development costs by specific project 
instead  we track costs by the type of cost incurred 
in  approximately of our research and development expenditures were for preclinical research  approximately was spent on clinical development and approximately was spent on manufacturing development 
changes in our research and development expenses are primarily due to the following clinical development costs overall clinical costs for increased by million from the increase in clinical costs in was due to the commencement of the xibrom phase iii clinical trial 
as a result  our overall clinical costs  which include clinical investigator fees  study monitoring costs and data management  increased in as compared to regulatory costs regulatory costs for increased by  from the increase is primarily attributable to the nda filing fee associated with vitrase for use as a spreading agent 
direct research costs research costs for decreased by million from this decrease is principally attributable to an overall reduction in development costs as our products advance further in the pipeline 
additionally  included the acquisition of three late stage development compounds 
the costs associated with such acquisition million were immediately expensed as in process research and development costs because there were no alternative future uses and did not otherwise quality for capitalization 
manufacturing development costs contract manufacturing costs for increased by million from the increase in manufacturing development costs was due to increased development and or manufacturing spending related to vitrase  istalol  and xibrom 
we anticipate that our research and development expenses for will be approximately the same as our research and development expenses for  and will be focused primarily on further research and development of our product candidates 
our primary product candidates are vitrase  istalol  xibrom and caprogel 
vitrase for the treatment of vitreous hemorrhage on april   the fda issued an approvable letter in which the fda cited issues primarily related to the sufficiency of the efficacy data submitted with the nda for vitrase 
the fda requested additional analysis of the existing data and an additional confirmatory clinical study based on that analysis 
we have submitted information to the fda in response to its non clinical comments contained in the approvable letter and are continuing to assess and discuss with the agency the clinical issues raised in the approvable letter 
based upon these discussions  we will determine the next appropriate steps in the approval process of vitrase for the treatment of vitreous hemorrhage 
vitrase for use as a spreading agent to facilitate the diffusion and absorption of injected drugs in august  we submitted to the fda a second nda for vitrase for use as a spreading agent to facilitate the dispersion and absorption of other drugs 
the fda granted priority review status for this nda in august and accepted the nda for filing and review in october in february  the fda notified us that it was extending the pdufa action date days to may  based upon current discussions with the fda  we believe that any remaining issues  and the fda review  can be addressed within the revised time frame 
the product we submitted in the second nda is the same formulation as the product we submitted in the original nda for the treatment of vitreous hemorrhage 
the dose as a spreading agent is different than the dose used for injection into the posterior region of the eye 
with respect to the second vitrase nda  we are pursuing the development of additional package configurations for different dosages of the product to facilitate product utilization  improve profit margins and aid in obtaining appropriate third party reimbursement 
upon approval of the second vitrase nda  we intend to submit supplemental filings with the fda with respect to such additional package configurations 

table of contents vitrase for the treatment of diabetic retinopathy we have completed a patient pilot phase ii clinical study in mexico city to evaluate the safety and efficacy of vitrase for the treatment diabetic retinopathy 
the continued development of vitrase for the treatment of diabetic retinopathy is dependent upon a number of factors including among others  the fda s evaluation of the vitrase ndas for the treatment of vitreous hemorrhage and for use as a spreading agent  the successful completion of any additional clinical trials for the diabetic retinopathy indication and the continuing assessment of the market opportunity for this indication as compared to other product opportunities we may be pursuing at the time 
istalol senju submitted a nda for istalol to the fda in september  which was accepted for review in november the nda is based on data from a phase i clinical study and a multi center phase iii clinical trial conducted in the united states  as well as results from preclinical studies and phase i and phase ii studies conducted in japan 
in july  the fda issued an approvable letter with respect to the istalol nda citing issues related to manufacturing methods and controls 
no additional clinical studies were requested 
we believe the issues cited by the fda are addressable  and we are currently seeking qualification of an additional manufacturing site 
in december  we submitted to the fda information seeking to qualify bausch lomb incorporated as an alternate manufacturer for istalol 
we expect a response from the fda in the first half of xibrom phase i  phase ii and phase iii clinical studies have been completed in japan and the product has been approved and was launched in in japan 
we completed our phase iii studies of xibrom and announced initial results of our clinical studies in march based on the initial results of our phase iii studies  we anticipate submitting a nda for xibrom in the second quarter of caprogel we are currently conducting feasibility studies for the reformulation and commercialization of caprogel 
once completed  and if these studies yield promising results  we intend to pursue further clinical development of caprogel consistent with such studies results 
however  the timing and scope for our development of caprogel may change based on our assessment  from time to time  of this product candidate s market potential  other product opportunities and our corporate priorities 
our research and development activities reflect our efforts to advance our product candidates through the various stages of pre clinical  clinical and regulatory product development 
the expenditures that will be necessary to execute our development plans are subject to numerous uncertainties  which may affect our research and development expenditures and capital resources 
for instance  the duration and the cost of clinical trials may vary significantly depending on a variety of factors including a trial s protocol  the number of patients in the trial  the duration of patient follow up  the number of clinical sites in the trial  and the length of time required to enroll suitable patient subjects 
even if earlier results are positive  we may obtain different results in later stages of development  including failure to show the desired safety or efficacy  which could impact our development expenditures for a particular product candidate 
although we spend a considerable amount of time planning our development activities  we may be required to alter from our plan based on new circumstances or events or our assessment from time to time of a product candidate s market potential  other product opportunities and our corporate priorities 
any deviation from our plan may require us to incur additional expenditures or accelerate or delay the timing of our development spending 
furthermore  as we obtain results from trials and review the path toward regulatory approval  we may elect to discontinue development of certain product candidates in certain indications  in order to focus our resources on more promising candidates or indications 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million in  million in and million in the  increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in was a result of approximately  in directors and officers liability insurance premiums   consultant related costs associated with increased activity with our product pipeline   in marketing activities  offset by a million decrease in deferred compensation related to stock based compensation 
the increase in general and administrative expenses in was primarily attributable to approximately  in directors and officers liability insurance premiums   in the level of consultant related costs associated with our product acquisitions  with the remainder attributable to personnel expenses related to new management 
stock based compensation 
deferred compensation for stock options granted to employees and directors is the difference between the exercise price and the estimated fair value of the underlying common stock for financial 
table of contents reporting purposes on the date the options were granted 
deferred compensation is included as a component of stockholders equity and is being amortized in accordance with financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
fin  accounting for stock appreciation rights and other variable stock option or award plans  over the vesting period of the related options  which is generally four years 
compensation for stock options granted to non employees has been determined in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and emerging issues task force eitf consensus no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring or in conjunction with selling goods or services  as the fair value of the equity instrument issued and is periodically re measured as the underlying options vest 
stock option compensation for non employees is recorded as the related services are rendered and the value of compensation is periodically re measured as the underlying options vest 
for the year ended december   we granted stock options to employees to purchase  shares of common stock at a weighted average exercise price of per share  equal to the fair market value of our common stock at the time of grant 
however  in previous years  we had granted stock options to employees with a grant price less than the fair market value at the date of grant 
therefore  we anticipate recording deferred compensation expense of approximately   and  for the years ended december   and respectively  related to these option grants 
in connection with the grant of stock options to employees and directors  we recorded deferred compensation of approximately   and  during the years ended december   and  respectively  and recorded amortization of   and  during the years ended december   and  respectively 
interest income 
interest income was  in   in and  in the increase in interest income in is primarily attributable to higher average cash balances on hand as compared to the decrease in interest income in over the prior year was primarily attributable to lower average cash balances on hand 
we anticipate interest income to be lower in as compared to due to lower average cash balances in our short term investment portfolio 
interest expense 
interest expense was approximately  in   in and  in interest expense incurred during was primarily attributable to the interest paid on the financing of our directors and officers insurance premiums 
interest expense incurred during was primarily attributable to approximately  related to the amortization of the fair value of the warrants issued in connection with the bridge loan in september interest expense incurred during was primarily attributable to the interest paid on the financing of our directors and officers insurance premiums 
we had no capital leases during income taxes 
we incurred net operating losses in  and and consequently did not pay any federal  state or foreign income taxes 
at december   we had federal and california net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively  which we have fully reserved due to the uncertainty of realization 
our federal tax loss carryforwards will begin to expire in  unless previously utilized 
our california tax loss carryforwards will begin to expire in  unless previously utilized 
we also have federal and california research tax credit carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
the federal research tax credits will begin to expire in  unless previously utilized 
our california research tax credit carryforwards do not expire and will carryforward indefinitely until utilized 
in addition  we have california manufacturers investment credit of approximately  that will begin to expire in  unless previously utilized 
during  a change in ownership  as described in the internal revenue code section  did occur and will limit our ability to utilize the net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards in the future

all historical common shares and per share data have been adjusted for the reverse stock split 
additionally  in november we consummated a private investment in public equity transaction  which resulted in the issuance of  shares of common stock and in november  we completed a follow on public offering  which resulted in the issuance of  shares of common stock 
research development expenses 
during  our quarterly research and development expenses increased primarily as a result of the commencement of the xibrom phase iii clinical trial and increased development and or manufacturing spending related to vitrase  istalol  and xibrom 
during  our quarterly research and development expenses decreased primarily as a result of the completion of our phase iii clinical trials for vitrase for the treatment of vitreous hemorrhage and the deferral of other development activities relating to our other product candidates 
the decrease in activity during was offset by the acquisition costs related to the three late stage development compounds from acsentient during may the acquisition costs were expensed immediately as in process research and development costs 
vitrase development activities included the collection and review of clinical data from study sites around the world  improvements in the manufacturing process of our contract manufacturers and preparations for the submission of a nda to the fda 
selling  general administrative expenses 
during  our quarterly selling  general and administrative expenses increased primarily as a result of additional personnel expenses with the hiring of two additional key management employees and two additional executive employees  and other related facilities expenses 
during  our selling  general and administrative expenses increased primarily as a result of increases in personnel and operating expenses consisting of non cash compensation associated with stock option grants  legal and accounting expenses relating to due diligence efforts for a potential acquisition  and personnel costs associated with the hiring of two additional executive employees 
interest income expense  net 
during  our quarterly net interest income increased from due to higher cash balances as a result of the pipe transaction in november and the follow on public offering in november during the fourth quarter of  our interest expense increased significantly as a result of the amortization of the fair value attributable to the warrants issued in connection with the million bridge loan in september net loss per common share  basic and diluted

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as well as disclosures included elsewhere in this report are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
actual results could differ from these estimates and could affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosure of contingencies 
we believe that the critical accounting policies that most impact the consolidated financial statements are as described below 
a summary of our significant accounting policies is included in note to our consolidated financial statements which begin on page f we recognize revenue consistent with the provisions of the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition  which sets forth guidelines in the timing of revenue recognition based upon factors such as passage of title  installation  payments and customer acceptance 
amounts received for product and technology license fees under multiple element arrangements are deferred and recognized over the period of such services or performance if such arrangements require on going services or performance 
amounts received for milestones are recognized upon achievement of the milestone  unless the amounts received are creditable against royalties or we have ongoing performance obligations 
royalty revenue will be recognized upon sale of the related products  provided the royalty amounts are fixed and determinable and collection of the related receivable is probable 
any amounts received prior to satisfying our revenue recognition criteria will be recorded as deferred revenue in the accompanying balance sheets 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had approximately million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and working capital of million 
we have financed our operations since inception primarily through private equity sales and the sale of our common stock in our initial and follow on public offerings 
we received net proceeds of million from the private sale of preferred stock in march  million from our initial public offering in august  million from the private sale of common stock in december  million from a license fee payment in december  million from the issuance of promissory notes in september  million from our pipe transaction in november and million from our follow on public offering in november the pipe transaction in november involved a private placement of  shares of our common stock for the aggregate purchase price of approximately million  or per share  and warrants to purchase up to  shares of our common stock for an exercise price of per share 
the follow on public offering in november involved the sale of  shares of our common stock for the aggregate purchase price of million  or per share

during  we used million of cash for operations principally as a result of the net loss of million partially offset by the non cash compensation expense of million and million in deferred income 
net cash invested totaled million during compared to  net cash invested during during  million of cash was provided by investing activities 
cash used for investing activities in 
table of contents is primarily attributable to the follow on public offering of  shares of common stock at an aggregate purchase price of million  or per share 
during  the net cash invested was primarily attributable to the purchase of short term investments 
net cash provided by financing activities totaled million during compared to million in and million in the net cash provided by financing activities in is primarily attributable to million net proceeds from the public sale of  shares of common stock in november  while the cash provided by financing activities in is primarily attributable to million net proceeds from the issuance of a bridge loan in september and the million net proceeds from the private sale of common stock to certain investors during november we may be required to raise additional capital in the future through collaborative agreements  pipe related financings  and various other public or private equity or debt financings 
if we are required to raise additional capital in the future  there can be no assurance that the additional financing will be available on favorable terms  or at all 
we continually evaluate new opportunities for late stage or currently marketed complementary product candidates and  if and when appropriate  intend to pursue such opportunities through the acquisitions of companies  products  or technology and our own research and development activities 
our ability to execute on such opportunities in some circumstances will be dependent  in part  upon our ability to raise additional capital on commercially reasonable terms 
there can be no assurance that funds from these sources will be available when needed or  if available  will be on terms favorable to us or to our stockholders 
if additional funds are raised by issuing equity securities  the percentage ownership of our stockholders will be reduced  stockholders may experience additional dilution or such equity securities may provide for rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock 
our actual future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the following receiving payments from allergan and otsuka with respect to our collaboration for the commercialization of vitrase for uses in the posterior region of the eye  including milestone payments  profit sharing and royalties  the rate of progress of our research and development programs  the results of our clinical trials and requirements to conduct additional clinical trials  the time and expense necessary to obtain regulatory approvals  activities and payments in connection with obtaining licenses for or acquisition of products  our ability to establish and maintain collaborative relationships  sales and marketing activities related to our product candidates  competitive  technological  market and other developments  and the success of the commercialization of our products 

table of contents tabular disclosure of contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations total visionex visionex was established in  under the laws of singapore  to engage in clinical  regulatory and marketing activities 
during  visionex obtained from us the exclusive rights to register  import  market  sell and distribute vitrase and a product called keraform in east asian markets  excluding japan and korea  for which visionex paid us million 
prior to our acquisition of visionex discussed below  investors who owned of ista shares controlled of visionex shares 
on march   we acquired visionex by entering into an agreement with visionex shareholders whereby we issued  shares of our series c preferred stock  convertible into  shares of our common stock  to acquire all of the outstanding capital stock of visionex 
we assigned a fair value of per share to the  shares of series c preferred stock issued to effect the acquisition  at which time we recorded a deemed dividend of million to recognize the excess of the value of the shares issued over the net assets acquired 
under singapore tax law  visionex was subject to a withholding tax on a million license that it paid to us in connection with a license to market  sell and distribute our vitrase and corneaplasty products in certain countries in southeast asia 
this withholding tax was waived by the economic development board  or edb  of singapore subject to various conditions  including a commitment that visionex would implement a proposed project to expand its business activities in singapore to the benefit of the local economy 
we substantially wound down visionex operations in july  and the proposed project was never implemented 
based upon a letter we received from the edb and our assessment of our obligations with the edb  management does not believe that we will be required to pay any withholding tax or related obligations in connection with the license fee 
however  if we are required to pay this withholding tax  our financial condition will suffer 
new accounting pronouncement in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
sfas no 
is an amendment to sfas no 
providing alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and also provides additional disclosures about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
amendments are effective for our financial statements beginning january  we have currently chosen to not adopt the voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
if we should choose to adopt such a method  its implementation pursuant to sfas no 
could have a material effect on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we invest in may have market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the principal amount of our investment will probably decline 
to minimize this risk in the future  we intend to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  money market funds  government and non government debt securities 
the average duration of all of our investments in was less than one year 
due to the short term nature of these investments  we believe we have no material exposure to interest rate risk arising from 
table of contents our investments 
a hypothetical basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially affect the fair market value of our interest sensitive financial investments 
declines in interest rates over time will  however  reduce our investment income  while increases in interest rates over time will increase our interest expense 
historically  and as of december   we have not used derivative instruments or engaged in hedging activities 
we have operated primarily in the united states and have had no sales to date 
accordingly  we have not had any significant exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations 
visionex s functional currency is the singapore dollar and a portion of visionex s business was conducted in currencies other than the singapore dollar prior to the wind down of operations in july as a result  currency fluctuations between the singapore dollar and the currencies in which visionex had done business will cause foreign currency translation gains and losses 
we do not expect our foreign currency translation gains or losses to be material 
we do not currently engage in foreign exchange hedging transactions to manage our foreign currency exposure
