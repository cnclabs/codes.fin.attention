item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the selected consolidated financial data and our financial statements and the related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
the actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including but not limited to those described in exhibit to this annual report 
overview we are a leading designer  manufacturer and marketer of medical products 
many of our products are single patient use airway products 
our products address the anesthesia and respiratory critical care markets as well as the sleep personal ventilation markets and the pharmaceutical technology services market 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements for segment information 
in fiscal  we classified our vital pharma business as a discontinued operation 
accordingly  the results of vital pharma are not included in continuing operations in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
on october   we sold our vital pharma subsidiary to pro clinical  inc no further gain or loss was recorded on the sale 
our net revenue was derived from four business segments as follows during the periods indicated fiscal years ended september  products and services in thousands anesthesia    respiratory critical care    sleep    pharmaceutical technology services    rebate allowance adjustment  other  total    reflects an adjustment made during the second quarter of fiscal see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting principles and estimates 
this rebate adjustment relates to our anesthesia and respiratory critical care segment 
other relates primarily to one time licensing revenue relating to our anesthesia segment recorded in the first quarter of fiscal see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting principles and estimates 
the percentage of our net revenue derived from each of our product lines was as follows during the periods indicated fiscal years ended september  products and services anesthesia respiratory critical care sleep pharmaceutical technology services rebate allowance adjustment other total we sell our products in over countries worldwide 
in the us  we sell most of our anesthesia and respiratory critical care products primarily to hospitals using our direct sales force and certain major health care distributors 
outside of the us  most of our anesthesia and respiratory critical care sales have been made through a strategic alliance agreement with a medical device manufacturer and distributor  rusch gmbh 
our sleep ventilation products are sold primarily outside of the us through our direct sales force and country specific distributors 
we compensate our direct sales force principally though salary and commission payments  included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
sales to distributors are made at our established price 
when the distributor provides us with documentation verifying that the product has been shipped to an end user that is entitled to a price lower than our established price  we owe the distributor a rebate equal to the difference between our established price and the lower price to which that end user is entitled 
the allowance for rebates is recorded at the time the company records the revenue for the product sold to the distributor 
we record this sales rebate allowance as a reduction of gross revenue 
recent acquisitions as part of our strategic plan to expand significantly into the obstructive sleep apnea field  we acquired our interests in our breas medical ab and sleep services of america subsidiaries through a series of transactions over a period of several years breas medical ab o during the period from november through may   we acquired a ownership stake in breas for million 
o on may   we purchased an additional of breas from two minority shareholders  for an initial payment of million  with an earnout based on a formula of sales and profits 
o the final earnout payment to the two minority shareholders for the additional  totaling million  was made in april o our final purchase  amounting to million  for the remaining of the minority interest in breas  was completed in april o the total purchase price for breas was approximately million 
sleep services of america o in june through may  we purchased million of common stock and convertible preferred stock of national sleep technologies  a company engaged in the operation of diagnostic sleep centers

no cash was contributed at that time 
instead  we received a equity interest in sleep services of america 
an affiliate of johns hopkins health system corporation received a equity interest in sleep services of america and the other minority shareholders of national sleep technologies received a interest in sleep services of america 
o subsequent to the merger  we paid  to certain of the minority shareholders to increase our ownership to  and reduce the minority ownership to 
o the portion of sleep services of america not owned by us is recorded as a minority interest 
see results of operations for fiscal and revenue and operating income information 
stelex tvg on march   we acquired stelex inc for million in cash 
stelex was a private company which  like our subsidiary  the validation group  inc  was engaged in regulatory compliance counseling 
we structured the transaction as a merger of stelex into the validation group  renamed the surviving corporation stelex the validation group  inc and accounted for the transaction as a purchase 
the subsidiary now operates under the name stelex  inc critical accounting principles and estimates we have identified the following critical accounting principles that affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to asset impairment  revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  and contingencies and litigation 
we state these accounting policies in the notes to our consolidated financial statements and at relevant places in this discussion and analysis 
these estimates are based on the information that is currently available to us and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could vary from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the following critical accounting principles affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements o through september   we amortized goodwill and intangibles on a straight line basis over their estimated lives 
upon our adoption of sfas no 
on october   we ceased amortizing goodwill and we perform an annual impairment analysis based upon discounted cash flows to assess the recoverability of the goodwill  in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
we completed this impairment test during the three month period ended march  and found no impairment 
if we are required to record impairment charges in the future  it would have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
goodwill amounted to  at september  and o we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments  which results in bad debt expense 
our allowance for doubtful accounts was  at september  and  at september  we determine the adequacy of this allowance by evaluating individual customer receivables  considering the customer s financial condition and credit history and analyzing current economic conditions 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
o our sales to us distributors are made at our established distributor price 
since the end user ie  a hospital is typically entitled  on a case by case basis  to a price lower than our established distributor price  the distributor is then due a rebate the difference between the established price and the lower price to which the end user is entitled when shipment is made to the end user 
in order to properly reflect our sales to distributors  we record the gross sale at our established price  less the amount of the expected rebate  to arrive at the net sale 
this net sale is the amount we expect to receive in cash from the distributor on the sale 
on a monthly basis  each distributor provides us with documentation of shipments to particular end users and computes a rebate claim on such shipments 
once the distributor has provided us with this claim  the distributor will deduct the computed rebate from its net remittance 
the amount of the estimated rebate that has not yet been taken by the distributor through the reduction of a payment is included in the allowance for rebates  which reduces the accounts receivable on our balance sheet 
this allowance is calculated by adding the amount of rebates claimed by the distributors through documentation but not yet reimbursed and an estimate by the company of the amount of future rebates due on any inventory that the distributors are holding at the end of each period 
for several years  we utilized an historical moving average calculation comparing rebates to sales to distributors in order to estimate the amount of rebate expense that should be recorded against gross sales in each period 
based upon a review conducted in connection with the filing of our quarterly report on form q for the quarter ended march   the company concluded that the required allowance calculated as described in the previous paragraph was greater than previously calculated by means of the historical moving average calculation 
as a result of this review of the rebate allowance  we recorded an additional allowance for rebates of  in the second quarter of fiscal we have continued to monitor the recorded allowance for rebates  as well as the payments made against this estimate  and believe we are now providing a better estimate of the ultimate rebate our distributors are entitled to than the estimate arrived at through utilization of the historical moving average calculation 
the allowance for rebates was  and  at september  and september   respectively 
rebate expense was  and  for the fiscal years ended september  and  respectively o we are subject to various claims and legal actions in the ordinary course of our business 
these matters frequently arise in disputes regarding the rights to intellectual property  where it is difficult to assess the likelihood of success and even more difficult to assess the probable ranges of recovery 
although we currently are not aware of any legal proceeding that is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations  if we become aware of any such claims against us  we will evaluate the probability of an adverse outcome and provide accruals for such contingencies as necessary 
o we have established an allowance for inventory obsolescence 
the allowance was determined by performing an aging analysis of the inventory  based upon this allowance  inventory is stated at the lower of cost first in  first out method or its net realizable value 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company wrote off certain inventory amounting to  our inventory allowance for obsolescence was  at september  and  at september  accounting principles

in fiscal capitalized costs were approximately million  and primarily included expenditures for equipment used as part of cost improvement projects at our breas subsidiary  new jersey facility  colorado facility  mis improvements  new tooling and molds  and thomas medical products facility  and the capitalized costs of software development million and patents 
we expect that our capitalized costs in the future will depend in part upon the capital requirements of any businesses that we acquire 
we are in the process of evaluating our information processing capabilities and potential upgrades or replacements to these systems 
additional capital expenditures will be required for these purposes 
non capital expenditures related to these items may also be incurred 
our current policy is to retain working capital and earnings for use in our business  subject to the payment of certain cash dividends
