item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview fiscal was another record year for us 
home sales revenues increased by over fiscal and net income increased by 
in addition  our backlog of homes under contract but not yet delivered to home buyers backlog at october  was greater than the backlog at october  based upon the increased level of backlog  the continued strong trend in new orders and the expected new community openings in fiscal  we expect fiscal to be another record year of revenues and income 
we currently own or control over  home sites in affluent markets  a substantial number of which have the necessary development approvals 
we believe that as the approval process becomes more difficult and the political pressure from no growth proponents increases  our expertise in taking land through the approval process and our already approved land positions will allow us to continue to grow in fiscal and beyond 
because of the strong demand for our homes  we have been able to increase the base selling prices in many of our communities during the past several years 
because of the length of time that it takes to obtain the necessary approvals on a property  complete the land improvements on it  and deliver a home after a home buyer signs an agreement of sale  we and other home builders are subject to many risks 
we attempt to reduce certain risks by controlling land for future development through options whenever possible  thus allowing us to obtain the necessary governmental approvals before acquiring title to the land  generally commencing construction of a home after executing an agreement of sale with a buyer  and using subcontractors to perform home construction and land development work on a fixed price basis 
in the ordinary course of doing business  we must make estimates and judgments that affect decisions on how we operate and the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
these estimates include  but are not limited to  those related to the recognition of income and expenses  impairment of assets  estimates of future improvement and amenity costs  capitalization of costs to inventory  provisions for litigation  insurance and warranty costs  and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
on an ongoing basis we evaluate and adjust our estimates based on the information currently available 
actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions or conditions 
we have grown on average over per year in the last decade 
we have funded this growth through the reinvestment of profits  bank borrowings and capital market transactions 
in order to help fund our growth in fiscal and beyond  we raised approximately million from a common stock offering in august and raised million in two senior note offerings  a portion of which was used to retire million of senior subordinated notes which had shorter maturities and higher interest rates 
at october   we had million of cash and cash equivalents and approximately million net of million of letters of credit available under our bank revolving credit facility 
with these resources  our strong cash flow from operations before inventory growth and our record of accessing the public debt and equity markets  we believe we have the resources available to continue to grow in and beyond 
critical accounting policies we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
inventory inventory is stated at the lower of cost or fair value in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
in addition to direct acquisition  land development and home construction costs  costs include interest  real estate taxes and direct overhead costs related to development and construction  which are capitalized to inventories during the period beginning with the commencement of development and ending with the completion of construction 
it takes approximately four to five years to fully develop  sell and deliver all the homes in one of our typical communities 
longer or shorter time periods are possible depending on the number of home sites in a community 
our master planned communities  consisting of several smaller communities  may take up to years or more to complete 
because our inventory is considered a long lived asset under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  we are required to review the carrying value of each of our communities and write down the value of those communities for which we believe the values are not recoverable 
when the profitability of a current community deteriorates or the sales pace declines significantly or some other factor indicates a possible impairment in the recoverability of the asset  we evaluate the property in accordance with the guidelines of sfas no 
if this evaluation indicates that an impairment loss should be recognized  we charge cost of sales for the estimated impairment loss in the period determined 
in addition  we review all land held for future communities or future sections of current communities  whether owned or under contract  to determine whether or not we expect to proceed with the development of the land 
based upon this review  we decide a as to land that is under a purchase contract but not owned  whether the contract will be terminated or renegotiated  and b as to land we own  whether the land can be developed as contemplated or in an alternative manner  or should be sold 
we then further determine which costs that have been capitalized to the property are recoverable and which costs should be written off 
income recognition revenue and cost of sales are recorded at the time each home  or lot  is closed and title and possession are transferred to the buyer 
land  land development and related costs both incurred and estimated to be incurred in the future are amortized to the cost of homes closed based upon the total number of homes to be constructed in each community 
any changes to the estimated costs subsequent to the commencement of delivery of homes are allocated to the remaining undelivered homes in the community 
home construction and related costs are charged to the cost of homes closed under the specific identification method 
the estimated land  common area development and related costs of master planned communities including the cost of golf courses  net of their estimated residual value are allocated to individual communities within a master planned community on a relative sales value basis 
any change in the estimated cost is allocated to the remaining lots in each of the communities of the master planned community 
off balance sheet arrangements we have investments in and advances to three joint ventures with independent third parties to develop and sell land that was owned or is currently owned by our venture partners 
we recognize our share of earnings from the sale of lots to other builders 
we do not recognize earnings from lots we purchase from the joint ventures  but instead reduce our cost basis in these lots by our share of the earnings on the lot sales 
we are obligated to purchase lots from one of the joint ventures in which we have an interest  of which we have purchased to date 
we have the right to purchase up to lots from the second venture 
the third venture has sold all the land that it owned and is currently in the process of completing the final land improvements on the site  which could take months or more to complete 
two of the joint ventures also participate in the profits earned from home sales on lots sold to other builders above certain agreed upon price levels 
at october   we had approximately million invested in or advanced to the three joint ventures and were committed to contribute additional capital in an aggregate amount of approximately million if the joint ventures require it 
in october  we acquired substantially all of the assets of the manhattan building company 
one of the assets acquired was a interest in a joint venture that is building the sky club  a unit  story two tower structure  located in hoboken  new jersey 
at october   our investment in this joint venture was million 
we do not have any commitment to contribute additional capital to this joint venture 
to take advantage of commercial real estate opportunities  we formed toll brothers realty trust group the trust in the trust is effectively owned one third by us  one third by robert i 
toll  bruce e 
toll and members of his family  zvi barzilay and members of his family  joel h 
rassman  and other members of our senior management  and one third by the pennsylvania state employees retirement system 
we provide development  finance and management services to the trust and receive fees for our services 
the trust currently owns and operates several office buildings and an unit apartment complex which it developed in virginia  and is currently building a unit apartment complex in new jersey 
at october   our investment in the trust was million 
the trust has a million revolving credit facility that extends through june as collateral for this facility  we and the other groups of investors each entered into a subscription agreement whereby each group of investors agreed to invest up to an additional million if required by the trust 
the subscription agreements  which were due to expire in august  were extended until august we do not currently guarantee any indebtedness of the joint ventures or the trust 
our total commitment to these entities is not material to our financial condition 
these investments are accounted for on the equity method

fiscal compared to fiscal home sales home sales revenues for fiscal of billion  homes were higher than those of the comparable period of by approximately million  or 
the increase was attributable to an increase in the average price of the homes delivered and an increase in the number of homes delivered 
the increase in the average price of homes delivered in fiscal was the result of increased base selling prices  a shift in the location of homes delivered to more expensive areas and increased expenditures on options and lot premiums by our home buyers 
the increase in the number of homes delivered in fiscal was primarily due to the higher backlog of homes at october  as compared to october  which was primarily the result of a increase in the number of new contracts signed in fiscal over fiscal  and a increase in the number of contracts signed in the first six months of fiscal as compared to the first six months of fiscal the value of new sales contracts signed was billion  homes in fiscal  a increase over the billion  homes value of new sales contracts signed in fiscal the increase in fiscal was attributable to a increase in the number of units sold and a increase in the average selling price of the homes 
the increase in the average selling price in fiscal was attributable to increases in base selling prices and increases in option and lot premiums selected by our home buyers 
the increase in the number of units sold in fiscal was attributable to the continued demand for our homes and the increase in the number of communities from which we were selling homes 
we were selling from communities including seven communities which we acquired from richard r 
dostie  inc in september at october   compared to communities at october  at october  we expect to be selling from approximately communities 
we believe that the demand for our homes is attributable to an increase in the number of affluent households  the maturation of the baby boom generation  a constricted supply of available new home sites in our markets  attractive mortgage rates and the belief of potential customers that the purchase of a home is a stable investment in the current period of economic uncertainty 
at october   we had over  home sites under our control nationwide  compared to approximately  home sites at october  at october   our backlog of homes under contract was billion  homes  an increase of over the billion  homes backlog at october  the increase in backlog at october   compared to the backlog at october   was primarily attributable to the increase in the value and number of new contracts signed during fiscal as compared to fiscal  offset  in part  by an increase in the number of homes delivered in fiscal as compared to fiscal based on the size of our current backlog  the continued demand for our products  the increased number of selling communities from which we are operating and the additional communities we expect to open in the coming months  we believe that we will deliver between  and  homes in fiscal we estimate that the average price of the homes delivered will be between  and  in fiscal home costs as a percentage of home sales revenues decreased slightly in fiscal as compared to fiscal the decrease was primarily the result of selling prices increasing faster than costs 
in addition  we had lower inventory write offs in fiscal than in fiscal we incurred million in write offs in fiscal  as compared to million in fiscal for fiscal  we expect that home costs as a percentage of home sales will be equal to or slightly lower than the fiscal percentage 
land sales we are developing several communities in which we sell a portion of the land to other builders 
the amount of land sales will vary from year to year depending upon the scheduled timing of the delivery of the land parcels 
land sales revenues amounted to million in fiscal  including million from the sale of land to the trust 
see note to the financial statements  related party transactions  for a description of the sale to the trust 
land sales revenues in fiscal amounted to million 
land costs as a percentage of land sales revenues decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal due to lower cost parcels being sold in fiscal compared to for fiscal  we expect land sales revenues to be approximately million and land costs to be approximately of the sales value 
equity earnings in unconsolidated entities we are a participant in several joint ventures and in the trust 
we recognize income for our proportionate share of the earnings from these entities 
see off balance sheet arrangements for a description of our investments in and commitments to these entities 
earnings from the joint ventures will vary significantly from year to year 
for fiscal  we recognized million of earnings from these unconsolidated entities as compared to million in fiscal for fiscal  we expect to realize approximately million of income from our investments in the joint ventures and in the trust 
interest and other income for fiscal  interest and other income was million  an increase of million as compared to million in fiscal this increase was primarily the result of a million profit realized from the sale of a small commercial property in fiscal  and higher income realized from our ancillary businesses offset  in part  by decreases in forfeited customer deposits  lower management and construction fee income  and a decrease in gains from the sale of miscellaneous assets 
for fiscal  we expect interest and other income to be approximately million 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a in fiscal  sg a spending increased by  or million  as compared to fiscal  while revenues in fiscal increased by compared to fiscal the increased spending was principally due to higher sales commissions  higher costs incurred to operate the greater number of selling communities that we had during fiscal as compared to fiscal  increased compensation and benefit costs and higher insurance costs 
we expect that sg a as a percentage of revenues will increase slightly in fiscal as compared to fiscal s percentage 
we expect to open approximately communities in fiscal as compared to in fiscal and in fiscal expenses related to the early retirement of debt we recognized a pretax charge of million in fiscal representing the premium paid on the early redemption of our senior subordinated notes due and our senior subordinated notes due and the write off of unamortized bond issuance costs related to those notes 
no similar charge was incurred in fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal home sales home sales revenues for fiscal were higher than those for fiscal by approximately million  or 
this increase was attributable to a increase in the number of homes delivered and a increase in the average price of the homes delivered 
the increase in the average price of the homes delivered in fiscal was principally the result of increased base selling prices and an increase in the average value of options and lot premiums that our buyers paid 
in fiscal  our buyers paid approximately above the base selling price for options and lot premiums 
the slight increase in the number of homes delivered in fiscal was due primarily to the small increase in the number of delivering communities and a slight decline in the number of homes delivered per community 
we have encountered and continue to encounter delays in the opening of new communities and new sections of existing communities due to increased governmental regulation in many of the markets in which we operate 
these delays resulted in a decline in the number of selling communities we had in the later part of fiscal  which did not reverse until the middle of fiscal in addition  it often takes more than nine months from the signing of an agreement of sale to the delivery of a home to a buyer 
because of the delays in the opening of new communities in fiscal and and the long period of time before a new community can start delivering homes once it opens for sale  the increase in the average number of communities delivering homes in fiscal compared to fiscal was slight 
the number of homes delivered per community in fiscal declined slightly compared to fiscal this decline was primarily due to the decline in backlog at october  as compared to october  and a softness in new contract signings that we encountered in the first portion of the first quarter of fiscal the decline in backlog at october  and the softness in the first part of the first quarter of fiscal were due primarily to the slowing economy at the time  exacerbated by the tragic events of september  the value of new sales contracts signed was billion  homes in fiscal  a increase over the billion  homes signed in fiscal this increase was attributable to a increase in the number of homes sold and an increase in the average selling price of the homes due primarily to the location and size of homes sold and increases in base selling prices 
the increase in the number of homes sold was attributable to an increase in the number of communities from which we were selling and the continued demand for our homes 
at october   we were selling from communities compared to communities at october  we believe that the demand for our homes in fiscal was attributable to an increase in the number of affluent households  the maturation of the baby boom generation  a constricted supply of available new home sites  attractive mortgage rates and the belief on the part of potential customers that the purchase of a home is a stable investment in the current period of economic uncertainty 
at october   we had over  home sites under our control nationwide in markets we consider to be affluent 
at october   our backlog of homes under contract was billion  homes  higher than the billion  homes backlog at october  the increase in backlog was primarily attributable to the increase in the number of new contracts signed and the increased prices of the homes sold during fiscal as previously discussed 
home costs as a percentage of home sales revenues decreased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal the decrease was largely the result of selling prices increasing at a faster rate than costs  lower land and improvement costs  improved operating efficiencies and lower inventory write downs  offset  in part  by the cost of increased sales incentives provided to customers in the later part of the fourth quarter of fiscal and the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal these incentives were used to help increase new contract signings which were adversely affected by the economic slowdown in the later part of fiscal and the effect the tragic events of september  had on new orders 
we incurred million in write offs in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal land sales we are developing several master planned communities in which we sell land to other builders 
the amount of land sales revenues will vary from year to year depending upon the scheduled timing of the delivery of the land parcels 
land sales revenues amounted to million for fiscal  as compared to million for fiscal equity earnings in unconsolidated joint ventures we are a party to several joint ventures and in the trust 
we recognize income for our proportionate share of the earnings from these entities 
see off balance sheet arrangements for a narrative of our investments in and commitments to these entities 
in fiscal and  only two of the joint ventures were operating 
we recognized million of earnings from these entities in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decline in earnings was caused by the reduction in the number of lots delivered by one of the joint ventures in fiscal compared to fiscal the reduction in fiscal was the result of fewer lots being available for sale by the joint venture due to the delivery of the last lots owned by it 
earnings from joint ventures will vary significantly from year to year depending on the level of activity of the entities 
interest and other income interest and other income decreased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease was principally due to a decrease in interest income  a decrease in earnings from our ancillary businesses and a non recurring gain in fiscal from the sale of an office building constructed by us  offset  in part  by increased income from forfeited customer deposits 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a spending increased by million or in fiscal as compared to fiscal and increased as a percentage of revenues from in fiscal to in fiscal the increased spending was principally due to costs incurred because of the greater number of selling communities that we had during fiscal as compared to fiscal  costs associated with the continued expansion of the number of new communities and increased insurance costs  offset  in part  by the discontinuance of amortization of goodwill pursuant to our adoption of statement of financial accounting standards board no 
in november interest expense we determine interest expense on a specific lot by lot basis for our home building operations and on a parcel by parcel basis for land sales 
as a percentage of total revenues  interest expense varies depending on many factors including the period of time that we have owned the land  the length of time that the homes delivered during the period were under construction  and the interest rates and the amount of debt carried by us in proportion to the amount of our inventory during those periods 
interest expense as a percentage of revenues was slightly lower in fiscal than in fiscal and slightly higher in fiscal than in fiscal for fiscal  we expect interest expense to be approximately of total revenues 
income before income taxes income before income taxes increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal and increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal income taxes income taxes for fiscal  and were provided at effective rates of  and  respectively 
capital resources and liquidity funding for our operations has been provided principally by cash flow from operating activities  unsecured bank borrowings and the public debt and equity markets 
in general  cash flow from operating activities assumes that as each home is delivered we will purchase a home site to replace it 
because we own several years supply of home sites  we do not need to immediately buy home sites to replace the ones delivered 
accordingly  we believe that cash flow from operating activities before land inventory purchases is a better gauge of liquidity 
cash flow from operating activities before land inventory purchases has improved as operating results have improved 
one of the main factors that determines cash flow from operating activities before land inventory purchases  is the level of revenues from the delivery of homes and from land sales 
we anticipate that cash flow from operating activities before land inventory purchases will continue to be strong in fiscal due to the expected increase in home deliveries as compared to fiscal we expect that our inventory will continue to increase as we are currently negotiating and searching for additional opportunities to obtain control of land for future communities 
at october   we had option contracts to acquire land of approximately billion  of which approximately million had been paid or deposited 
we have used our cash flow from operating activities before land inventory purchases  bank borrowings and the proceeds of public debt and equity financing  to acquire additional land for new communities  fund additional expenditures for land development  fund construction costs needed to meet the requirements of our increased backlog and the increasing number of communities in which we are offering homes for sale  repurchase our stock  and repay debt 
we generally do not begin construction of a home until we have a signed contract with the home buyer 
because of the significant amount of time between the time a home buyer enters into a contract to purchase a home and the time that the home is built and delivered  we believe we can estimate with reasonable accuracy the number of homes we will deliver in the next six to nine months 
should our business decline significantly  our inventory would decrease as we complete and deliver the homes under construction but do not commence construction of as many new homes  resulting in a temporary increase in our cash flow from operations 
in addition  under such circumstances  we might delay or curtail our acquisition of additional land  which would further reduce our inventory levels and cash needs 
at october   we had a revolving credit facility of million which extends to march at october   we had no borrowings and approximately million of letters of credit outstanding under the facility 
during fiscal  we issued million of senior notes due and million of senior notes due we used the aggregate net proceeds to repay all of the million principal amount outstanding of our senior subordinated notes due  to repay all of the million principal amount outstanding of our senior subordinated notes due  to repay bank debt and for general corporate purposes 
in august  we sold in a public offering million shares of common stock for aggregate net sales proceeds of million 
the proceeds from this sale were used for general corporate purposes 
we believe that we will be able to continue to fund our activities through a combination of existing cash resources  cash flow from operating activities and the public debt and equity markets 
inflation the long term impact of inflation on us is manifested in increased costs for land  land development  construction and overhead  as well as in increased sales prices 
we generally contract for land significantly before development and sales efforts begin 
accordingly  to the extent land acquisition costs are fixed  increases or decreases in the sales prices of homes may affect our profits 
since the sales price of each of our homes is fixed at the time a buyer enters into contract to acquire a home  and because we generally contract to sell our homes before we begin construction  any inflation of costs in excess of those anticipated may result in lower gross margins 
we generally attempt to minimize that effect by entering into fixed price contracts with our subcontractors and material suppliers for specified periods of time  which generally do not exceed one year 
in general  housing demand is adversely affected by increases in interest costs  as well as in housing costs 
interest rates  the length of time that land remains in inventory and the proportion of inventory that is financed affect our interest costs 
if we are unable to raise sales prices enough to compensate for higher costs  or if mortgage interest rates increase significantly  affecting prospective buyers ability to adequately finance home purchases  our revenues  gross margins and net income would be adversely affected 
increases in sales prices  whether the result of inflation or demand  may affect the ability of prospective buyers to afford new homes 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk primarily due to fluctuations in interest rates 
we utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt 
for fixed rate debt  changes in interest rates generally affect the fair market value of the debt instrument  but not our earnings or cash flow 
conversely  for variable rate debt  changes in interest rates generally do not impact the fair market value of the debt instrument but do affect our earnings and cash flow 
we do not have the obligation to prepay fixed rate debt prior to maturity  and  as a result  interest rate risk and changes in fair market value should not have a significant impact on such debt until we are required to refinance such debt 
at october   our long term debt obligations  principal cash flows by scheduled maturity  weighted average interest rates and estimated fair value were as follows amounts in thousands fixed rate debt variable rate debt weighted weighted average average fiscal year of interest interest expected maturity amount rate amount rate thereafter   discount  total   fair value at october    we have a million revolving credit facility with banks which extends through march interest is payable on borrowings under this facility at this rate will vary based upon our corporate debt rating and leverage ratios above the eurodollar rate or at other specified variable rates as selected by us from time to time 
at october   we had no borrowings and approximately million of letters of credit outstanding under the facility 
one of our subsidiaries has a million line of credit with three banks to fund mortgage originations 
the line is due within days of demand by the banks and bears interest at the bank s overnight rate plus an agreed upon margin 
at october   the subsidiary had million outstanding under the line at an average interest rate of 
borrowing under this line is included in the fiscal maturities 
based upon the amount of variable rate debt outstanding at october   and holding the variable rate debt balance constant  each one percentage point increase in interest rates would increase the interest incurred by us by approximately 
million per year
