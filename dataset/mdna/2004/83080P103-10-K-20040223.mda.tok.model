loan portfolio real estate loans  including construction and mortgage loans  approximated of total loans at december   up from at year end the rise reflects stronger growth  including acquisitions  partially offset by declines due to higher refinancing activity 
sky financial s general collateral policy for residential real estate mortgages is to follow fnma and fhlmc guidelines  which generally require a loan to value ratio of or private mortgage insurance for loan to value ratios in excess of 
commercial loans comprise of the total loan portfolio for and growth in this portfolio reflects new business development in existing regional markets  as well as growth in the commercial financing loans originated through sfs 
sfs originates loans to healthcare professionals primarily for equipment purchases  practice acquisitions  practice startups  business expansions  working capital and debt consolidation 
the amount of collateral required on commercial loans is generally determined based on a loan by loan assessment 
loan to value ratios for commercial loans typically range from to 
factors that are considered include  among other things  the purpose of the loan  the current financial status of the borrower and the borrower s prior credit history 
sky financial has participated in a small portfolio of shared national credits 
these individual credit relationships total less than one half of one percent of the total loan portfolio with the businesses located in our current market area 
the remaining portion of sky financial s loan portfolio is installment loans  credit card loans and other loans  which decreased to of the loan portfolio from in the prior year 
the decrease is due to a reduced emphasis on indirect auto loans 
sky financial makes consumer loans on both a secured and unsecured basis depending  in part  on the nature  purpose and term of the loan 
loan to value ratios for secured consumer loans range from to as a general rule 
as of december   sky financial did not have any loan concentrations that exceeded of total loans 
sky financial monitors the levels of market segments contained in the loan portfolio 
sky financial considers loans originated by sfs as a market segment and has been managing the overall loan balances since the change in to retaining loans originated by sfs in its loan portfolio

under performing assets residential mortgage  installment and other consumer loans are collectively evaluated for impairment 
individual commercial loans exceeding size thresholds established by management are evaluated for impairment 
impaired loans are recorded at the loan s fair value by the establishment of a specific allowance where necessary 
the fair value of the collateral dependent loans is determined by the fair value of the underlying collateral 
the fair value of noncollateral dependent loans is determined by discounting expected future interest and principal payments at the loan s effective interest rate 
at december   impaired loans were  compared with  at december   the increase due primarily to acquisitions 
non accrual loans are comprised principally of loans days past due as well as certain loans  which are current but where serious doubt exists as to the ability of the borrower to comply with the repayment terms 
interest previously accrued and not yet paid on non accrual loans is reversed or charged against the allowance for credit losses during the period in which the loan is placed in a non accrual status  except where sky financial has determined that such loans are adequately secured as to principal and interest 
interest earned thereafter is included in income only to the extent that it is received in cash 
in certain cases  interest received may be credited against principal outstanding under the cost recovery method 
non accrual loans increased from  at december  to  at year end the increase in non accrual loans in has resulted from the overall growth in the loan portfolio last year  including acquisitions 
at december    of loans secured by pools of commercial leases for which payment is over days past due are on non accrual 
these loans are guaranteed by surety bonds or insurance policies issued by three creditworthy insurance companies 
sky is engaged in litigation with these insurance companies to enforce their payment obligations  as are a number of other banks nationwide 
after consultation with its counsel as to the strength of its position  sky financial believes that the credits are well secured and the prospects for recovery of all principal and interest are good 
at december   non performing assets were  an increase from  at the prior year end 
the increase was primarily in non performing loans  which at year end  totaled  or 
of total loans outstanding  compared with  or  of total loans outstanding at year end other real estate owned also increased  mainly as a result of acquisitions 
loans now performing  but where some concerns exist as to the ability of the borrower to comply with present loan repayment terms defined as loans rated substandard or worse but excluding non accrual and restructured loans  approximated  and  at december  and  respectively  and are being closely monitored by management and the boards of directors of sky financial and its subsidiaries 
the classification of these loans  however  does not imply that management expects losses on each of these loans  but believes that a higher level of scrutiny is prudent under the circumstances 
the increase in loans where some concern exists is reflective of growth in the loan portfolio 
these loans require close monitoring despite the fact that they are performing according to their terms 
such classifications relate to specific concerns relating to each individual borrower and do not relate to any concentrated risk elements common to all loans in this group

all lending activity contains associated risks of loan losses 
sky financial recognizes these credit risks as a necessary element of its business activity 
to assist in identifying and managing potential loan losses  sky financial maintains a loan review function that continuously evaluates individual credit relationships as well as overall loan portfolio conditions 
one of the primary objectives of this loan review function is to make recommendations to management as to both specific loss reserves and overall portfolio loss reserves 
the provision for credit losses for was  compared with  for and  in the change in the provision for credit losses was attributable to improved asset quality  which was a function of the improving economy

the allowance is comprised of a general allowance  a specific allowance for identified problem loans and an unallocated allowance 
the general allowance is determined by applying estimated loss factors to the credit exposures from outstanding loans 
for construction  commercial and commercial real estate loans  loss factors are applied based on internal risk grades of these loans 
for residential real estate  installment  credit card and other loans  loss factors are applied on a portfolio basis 
loss factors are based on sky financial s historical loss experience and are reviewed for modification on a quarterly basis  along with other factors affecting the collectibility of the loan portfolio 
specific allowances are established for all criticized and classified loans  where management has determined that  due to identified significant conditions  it is probable that a loss has been incurred that exceeds the general allowance loss factor for those loans 
the unallocated allowance recognizes the estimation risk associated with the allocated general and specific allowances and incorporates management s evaluation of existing conditions that are not included in the allocated allowance determinations 
these conditions are reviewed quarterly by management and include general economic conditions  credit quality trends  and internal loan review and regulatory examination findings 
at december   the allowance for credit losses was  or of total loans outstanding  and of total non performing loans compared to an allowance at december  of  or of total loans outstanding  and of total non performing loans 
at year end  the allocated portion of the allowance for credit losses was  compared with  at year end the increase to the allowance was due primarily to the overall growth in total loans of and the adjustment of loss factors for components of certain segments within the loan portfolio  particularly the commercial financing segment 
at year end  the unallocated portion of the allowance for credit losses was  compared with  at year end the decrease in the unallocated allowance was attributable to a decrease in sky financial s estimated risk associated with its specific and general allowances  while the outlook for general economic conditions has stabilized 
net charge offs increased to  compared with  in due to the increased size of the loan portfolio 
net charge offs as a percentage of average loans outstanding actually declined in to

in table allocation of the allowance for credit losses december  construction real estate commercial  financial and agricultural installment and credit card unallocated total securities the investment portfolio at sky financial is used as a management tool to maintain acceptable levels of liquidity and exposure to changes in market interest rates 
the portfolio yield is maximized once these criteria are satisfied 
during the last two years  the portfolio has shifted to include a greater percentage of mortgage backed securities 
mortgage backed securities offer monthly principal and interest and may be used as collateral in a variety of financial transactions to secure sources of wholesale funding 
the market for agency mortgage backed securities is large and liquid 
it is the practice of sky financial to purchase mortgage backed securities with average expected lives of two to four years 
since this type of security may extend or contract  a pre purchase analysis is completed 
most securities purchased have structures that limit changes to duration as market rates change 
in  total securities available for sale increased  primarily due to the acquisition of metropolitan and glb which added  and  respectively  to the portfolio 
in  total securities available for sale increased  which was due to the acquisition of three rivers  which added  to the portfolio 
the portfolio contains mortgage backed securities and  to a limited extent  other securities  that have uncertain cash flow characteristics 
the variable cash flows present additional risk to sky financial in the form of prepayment or extension risk primarily caused by changes in market interest rates 
this additional risk is generally rewarded in the form of higher yields 
sky financial utilizes a variety of tools to monitor and minimize this risk 
all securities must pass a stress test at the time of purchase estimating how the security would perform in various interest rate environments 
additionally  the corporate investment policy defines certain types of high risk securities ineligible for purchase  including securities that may not return full principal to sky financial 
it is also the practice of sky financial to minimize premiums paid on mortgage securities to avoid yield reduction if prepayments accelerate 
these policies help to ensure that there will be no material impact from these investments to the financial statements due to changes in market interest rates 
sky financial evaluates its securities portfolio for impairment throughout the year 
an impairment reserve is recorded against individual equity securities if their cost significantly exceeds their fair value for a substantial amount of time 
an impairment reserve is also recorded for investments in debt securities  unless the decrease in fair value is attributable to interest rates and management has the intent and ability to hold the debt security until maturity 
the securities portfolio does not contain any investments that have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for greater than twelve months at december  there are no securities of any single issuer where the aggregate carrying value of such securities exceed of shareholders equity  except those of the us treasury  us government agencies and substantially all mortgage backed securities issued by federal home loan mortgage corporation  federal national mortgage association and government national mortgage association 
table shows at amortized cost the contractual maturities and weighted average yields of sky financial s securities as of december  expected maturities will differ from contractual maturities because issuers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties

retail deposits are gathered from individuals and businesses within the local communities served by the banking affiliate 
deposits encompass the full range of banking products including checking  savings and time deposits 
in addition  sky financial obtains funds under a number of borrowing arrangements 
the banking affiliate is a member of the federal home loan bank and may obtain both overnight and term advances 
the banking affiliate also obtains funds through securities sold under repurchase agreements and federal funds lines 
sfs maintains a line of credit with a non affiliated bank to fund loans until permanent funding can be arranged through the issuance of asset backed notes in a limited offering 
sky financial issues  through its affiliates  fixed and variable interest rate asset backed notes in which repayment is secured and provided by the cash flows of commercial loans originated at sfs 
these notes are used to provide permanent funding for the sfs loans

these borrowings are collateralized with securities owned by sky bank and held in its safekeeping accounts at independent correspondent banks 
sky financial also has repurchase agreements with brokerage firms that are in possession of the underlying securities 
the securities are returned to sky financial at the maturity of the agreements 
sky financial also enters into derivative contracts under which it is required to either receive cash or pay cash to counterparties depending on changes in interest rates 
derivative contracts are carried at their fair value on the consolidated balance sheet with the fair value representing the net present value of expected future cash receipts or payments based on market interest rates as of the balance sheet date 
the contracts are primarily interest rate swaps and cash is settled quarterly 
because the derivative contracts recorded on the balance sheet at december  do not represent amounts that will ultimately be received or paid under these contracts  they are excluded from the table above 
a schedule of significant off balance sheet commitments at december  is included in table table significant commitments commitments to extend credit standby letters of credit letters of credit these commitments are extended to clients in the normal course of business and are subject to the same credit policies as making on balance commitments 
because many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total amounts do not represent future cash flow requirements 
sky financial also has recourse obligations on  of sold loans and leases originated by sfs prior to june  at december   sky financial has recorded a recourse provision related to these loans and leases of  liquidity management management of liquidity is of continuing importance to the banking industry 
the liquidity of a financial institution reflects its ability to meet loan requests  to accommodate possible outflows of deposits and to take advantage of interest rate market opportunities 
the ability of a financial institution to meet its current financial obligations is a function of balance sheet structure  the ability to liquidate assets  and the availability of alternative sources of funds 
to meet the needs of the clients and manage the risk of the bank  financial institutions have developed innovative ways to meet clients needs while at the same time manage both liquidity and interest rate risk 
this is being done primary through liquidity management and the balance of deposit growth and alternative sources of borrowing 
in addition to maintaining a stable core deposit base  sky financial s banking subsidiary maintains adequate liquidity primarily through the use of investment securities  unused borrowing capacity  security repurchase agreements  federal funds  and loan securitizations and sales 
at december   securities with maturities of one year or less totaled  in addition  the mortgage backed securities provide an estimated cash flow of approximately  over a twelve month timeframe

the fhlb provides a reliable source of funds with a wide variety of terms and structures 
as of december   the banking subsidiary had total credit availability with the fhlb of  of which  was outstanding 
sky financial  through one of its affiliates  entered into a conduit warehousing facility with a financial institution to provide up to  of interim funding for loans originated by sfs 
term funding is obtained later through the issuance of asset backed notes in a limited offering 
sfs has successfully issued seven asset backed notes since february sky financial is a holding company and does not conduct operations 
its primary sources of liquidity are borrowings from outside sources and dividends received from its subsidiaries 
for the banking subsidiary  regulatory approval is required in order to pay dividends in excess of the subsidiary s earnings retained for the current year plus retained net profits for the prior two years

under the current federal reserve board s regulatory framework  certain capital securities offered by wholly owned unconsolidated trust preferred entities of sky financial are included as tier i regulatory capital 
the federal reserve board is currently evaluating whether these capital securities continue as tier i capital as a result of deconsolidating the related trust preferred entities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principals 
if the federal reserve board disallows the capital securities as tier i regulatory capital  the effect of such a change could have a material impact on sky financial s regulatory ratios 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollars and shares in thousands  except per share data market risk management market risk is the risk that a financial institution s earnings and capital  or its ability to meet its business objectives  will be adversely affected by movements in market rates or prices such as interest rates  foreign exchange rates  equity prices  credit spreads and or commodity prices 
within sky financial  the dominant market risk exposure is changes in interest rates 
the negative effect of this exposure is felt through the net interest spread  mortgage banking revenues and the market values of various assets and liabilities 
sky financial manages market risk through its asset liability committee alco at both the subsidiary and consolidated levels 
the committee assesses interest rate risk exposure through three primary measurements rate sensitive assets divided by rate sensitive liabilities or gap ratios  interest rate shock simulations of net interest income at risk and economic value of equity risk simulation 
sky financial also utilizes interest rate swaps and caps to effectively modify its liability interest rate repricing to more effectively match the repricing characteristics of its assets 
at december   the fair value of sky financial s derivative arrangements aggregated  on contracts with notional amounts of  sky financial monitors and manages its rate sensitivity position to maximize net interest income  while minimizing the risk due to changes in interest rates 
one method sky financial uses to manage its interest rate risk is a rate sensitivity gap analysis 
the difference between a financial institution s interest rate sensitive assets ie assets that will mature or reprice within a specific time period and interest rate sensitive liabilities ie liabilities that will mature or reprice within the same time period is commonly referred to as its interest rate sensitivity gap or gap 
an institution having more interest rate sensitive assets than interest rate sensitive liabilities within a given time period is said to have a positive gap  which generally means that if interest rates increase  a company s net interest income will increase and if interest rates decrease  its net interest income will decrease 
an institution having more interest rate sensitive liabilities than interest rate assets within a given time period is said to have a negative gap  which generally means that if interest rates increase  a company s net interest income will decrease and if interest rates decrease  its net interest income will increase 
the current policy imposes limits at the six month and month time periods that is measured in terms of the ratio of cumulative rate sensitive assets divided by rate sensitive liabilities or rsa rsl 
table presents the gap position of sky financial at december  and table gap position year end year end max min six month one year the interest rate shock simulation analysis measures the potential effect on earnings that an instantaneous parallel change in general interest rates could have on net interest income and economic value of equity 
sky financial applies hypothetical interest rate shocks up  and basis points and down basis points to its financial instruments based on the assumed cash flows 
under the current interest rate environment  a declining basis point or greater scenario is improbable and therefore provide no meaningful results 
the economic value of equity measures the price risk of the entire balance sheet by discounting expected cash flows of all assets and liabilities and netting the result 
this provides a longer term view of the interest rate risk profile of the company  that is focused on the current economic value of assets and liabilities that make up the balance sheet at a static point in time 
the shock then examines how the economic value of the company would change if market rates were different 
as demonstrated in table  as of december   the projected volatility of net interest income and economic value of equity due to the hypothetical changes in market rates are within alco guidelines 
as a result of being in a historically low rate environment  sky financial is monitoring the effect of a basis point up scenario 
a policy limit for a basis point up scenario has not been proposed by management as of december  table rate shock analysis year end year end alco guidelines one year net interest income change basis points n a basis points basis points basis points net present value of equity change basis points n a basis points basis points basis points the preceeding analysis is based on numerous assumptions  including relative levels of market interest rates  loan prepayments and reactions of depositors to changes in interest rates  and should not be relied upon as being indicative of actual results 
further  the analysis does not necessarily contemplate all actions sky financial may undertake in response to changes in interest rates 
effects of inflation the assets and liabilities of sky financial are primarily monetary in nature and are more directly affected by the fluctuation in interest rates than inflation 
movement in interest rates is a result of the perceived changes in inflation as well as monetary and fiscal policies 
interest rates and inflation do not necessarily move with the same velocity or within the same period  therefore  a direct relationship to the inflation rate cannot be shown 
the financial information presented in this report has been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which require that sky financial measure financial position and operating results primarily in terms of historical dollars 
pending acquisition on january   sky financial announced an agreement to acquire second bancorp  incorporated second bancorp  a billion bank holding company headquartered in warren  ohio  and its wholly owned subsidiary second national bank 
under the terms of the agreement  shareholders of second bancorp will be entitled to receive sky financial common shares in exchange for each second bancorp common share held 
the exchange is expected to qualify as a tax free transaction to the second bancorp shareholders 
following the merger  and upon the receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals  second national bank will be merged with and into sky bank 
not considering the merger related charges discussed below  the merger is expected to be accretive to diluted earnings per share by approximately 
for the year due to the expected cost savings benefits achieved through the integration of systems and support functions  improved branch efficiencies and increased alternative delivery channels for financial products and services 
as a result of cost savings efforts  sky financial expects to reduce approximately of second bancorp s non interest expense or million on an annual basis and million during after the completion of the merger 
after tax merger related charges of approximately million or 
per diluted share are expected to be recognized in the second quarter of critical accounting policies and estimates the accounting and reporting policies of sky financial are in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted within the united states of america and conform to general practices within the banking industry 
accounting and reporting policies for the allowance for credit losses and mortgage servicing rights are deemed critical because they involve the use of estimates and require significant management judgments 
application of assumptions different than those used by management could result in material changes in sky financial s financial position or results of operations 
account allowance for credit losses balance sheet reference allowance for credit losses income statement reference provision for credit losses description the allowance for credit losses is an amount that management believes will be adequate to absorb probable incurred losses in existing loans taking into consideration such factors as past loss experience  changes in the nature and volume of the portfolio  overall portfolio quality  loan concentrations  specific problem loans  and current economic conditions that affect the borrower s ability to pay 
determination of the allowance is inherently subjective due to the aforementioned reasons 
loan losses are charged off against the allowance when management believes that the full collectability of the loan is unlikely 
recoveries of amounts previously charged off are credited to the allowance 
allowances established to provide for losses under commitments to extend credit  or recourse provisions under loan sales agreements or servicing agreements are classified with other liabilities 
a loan is considered impaired when it is probable that not all principal and interest amounts will be collected according to the loan contract 
residential mortgage  installment and other consumer loans are collectively evaluated for impairment 
individual commercial loans exceeding size thresholds established by management are evaluated for impairment 
impaired loans are recorded at the loan s fair value by the establishment of a specific allowance where necessary 
the fair value of collateral dependent loans is determined by the fair value of the underlying collateral 
the fair value of noncollateral dependent loans is determined by discounting expected future interest and principal payments at the loan s effective interest rate 
sky financial maintains the allowance for credit losses at a level adequate to absorb management s estimate of probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the allowance is comprised of a general allowance  a specific allowance for identified problem loans and an unallocated allowance which represent estimations done pursuant to either standard of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for contigencies  or sfas  accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
the general allowance is determined by applying estimated loss factors to the credit exposures from outstanding loans 
for construction  commercial and commercial real estate loans loss factors are applied based on internal risk grades of these loans 
many factors are considered when these grades are assigned to individual loans such as current and past delinquency  financial statements of the borrower  current net realizable value of collateral and the general economic environment and specific economic trends affecting the portfolio 
for residential real estate  installment  credit card and other loans loss factors are applied on a portfolio basis 
loss factors are based on sky financial s historical loss experience and are reviewed for modification on a quarterly basis  along with other factors affecting the collectibility of the loan portfolio 
specific allowances are established for all criticized and classified loans  where management has determined that  due to identified significant conditions  it is probable that a loss has been incurred that exceeds the general allowance loss factor for those loans 
the unallocated allowance recognizes the estimation risk associated with the allocated general and specific allowances and incorporates management s evaluation of existing conditions that are not included in the allocated allowance determinations 
these conditions are reviewed quarterly by management and include general economic conditions  credit quality trends and internal loan review and regulatory examination findings 
management believes that it uses the best information available to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
however  future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary and the results of operations could be significantly and adversely affected if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the determinations 
account mortgage servicing rights balance sheet reference other assets income statement reference mortgage banking income description the cost of mortgage loans sold or securitized is allocated between the mortgage servicing rights and the mortgage loans based on the relative fair values of each 
the fair value of the mortgage servicing rights is determined by using a discounted cash flow model  which estimates the present value of the future net cash flows of the servicing portfolio based on various factors  such as servicing costs  expected prepayment speeds and discount rates  about which management must make assumptions based on future expectations 
mortgage servicing rights are amortized in proportion to  and over the period of  estimated net servicing income 
management periodically evaluates mortgage servicing rights for impairment by stratifying the loans in the servicing portfolio primarily based on loan type  interest rate and region of origination 
impairment is measured by estimating the fair value of each stratum  taking into consideration the estimated level of prepayments based upon current industry expectations 
an impairment allowance for a stratum is recorded when  and in an amount which  its fair value is less than its carrying value 
the value of mortgage servicing rights is subject to prepayment risk 
future expected net cash flows from servicing a loan in our servicing portfolio will not be realized if the loan pays off earlier than anticipated 
moreover  since most loans within our servicing portfolio do not contain penalty provisions for early payoff  we will not receive a corresponding economic benefit if the loan pays off earlier than expected 
mortgage servicing rights represent the discounted present value of the future net cash flows we expect to receive from our servicing portfolio 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued interpretation no 
revised consolidation of variable interest entities  fin r 
fin r requires that subsidiaries defined as variable interest entities be consolidated by the enterprise that will absorb the majority of the entities expected losses if they occur  receive a majority of the variable interest entities residual returns if they occur  or both 
sky financial  through fully consolidated wholly owned subsidiaries  sponsors five trust preferred security issuing vehicles 
sky financial determined that these five trust preferred subsidiaries meet the definition of variable interest entities and that sky financial is not the primary beneficiary of these subsidiaries activities 
accordingly  with the adoption of fin r on december   sky financial deconsolidated the accounts of these trust preferred subsidiaries  resulting in a recharacterization of the underlying consolidated debt obligation from the previous trust preferred securities obligations to the junior subordinated debenture obligations exist between the sky financial and the trust preferred subsidiaries
