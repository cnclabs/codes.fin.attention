all references herein to  and  refer to the fiscal years ending september   august  and august   respectively 
overview we continue to believe the ipump  with its store and forward technology  is the right product for our markets and will make a significant contribution to future bookings and revenues 
the ipump media server uses a store and forward approach to network operations compared to traditional real time video and audio delivery networks 
the ipump media server provides customers with many additional capabilities not available in traditional real time delivery networks  such as streaming video and audio to the desktop  more efficient use of expensive satellite bandwidth and the ability to originate two complete television networks from a single unit 
although our results for fiscal were disappointing  we believe that the store and forward market is just beginning to see the potential of this new technology 
in some cases  we have had to educate potential customers on the benefits of the technology  which has lengthened the sales cycle 
in addition  the system is complex enough that many end customers are not running the networks themselves  they are contracting third party integrators and service providers for network operations 
in these applications  our sales team has more limited access to the end customers  which reduces our visibility on the sales 
additionally  key customers have deferred purchasing decisions until calendar year due to budget constraints caused by a weak economy 
the ipump has experienced delays in feature introductions and resulting bookings and revenues 
a number of factors have contributed to this 
some of the delays were due to the inherent complexity of the hardware and software development 
the conceptual design of the ipump allows for extremely varied applications for the product  which caused us to try to focus on too many applications 
we now have a clear set of applications that we are targeting for the product 
additionally  new features and functionality have been added to the original design  which resulted from prospective customers feedback 
for example  our mediaplan i o and mediaplan cm modules were added to enhance content management and ease of network operations 
capacity  file transfer speeds and other enhancements were added to meet application requirements 
we believe this has resulted in a more desirable  marketable and technologically advanced product 
in order to achieve better results  we undertook a rigorous fiscal planning process in september the planning resulted in extensive plans for operational  financial and organizational goals for the year 
we anticipate clearer focus and execution within the organization based on the planning process 
current developments growth opportunities are most significant in the business private network market with our ipump solutions 
we are in the process of deploying our first large scale rollout of ipump and are working with multiple customers on pilot programs 
our ipump  mediaplan and compel products create systems that directly address the next generation needs of satellite delivery of content 
product approval of the dtv series product line is underway with major cable multiple system operators msos  which is required before their affiliates can purchase our dtv products 
charter  time warner  adelphia and comcast have all approved some or all versions of our dtv products 
customers  integrators and partners have expressed great interest in our recently announced ip settop box  called the streaming media decoder smd it allows phone companies to provide television service to consumers over their existing dsl high speed internet connections to complete the triple play of telephone  television and internet service offerings 
the smd settop supports standard and high definition television 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we booked an order for  from a business music network customer 
this new order extends and amends our existing multi year contract into fiscal year this order is not reflected in the backlog reported as of september   but will be reflected in the backlog to be reported at the end of the first quarter of fiscal and will increase the total multi year backlog significantly 
third party offshore contract manufacturers are being used for high volume products  such as the unity r  ipump and other products  to secure competitive product pricing 
additionally  key partnerships continue to develop with complementary companies in our market space to meet customer demands for complete network solutions 
internally  we continue to focus on maintaining iso certification 
the rebranding of our corporate image was unveiled at the national association of broadcasters nab tradeshow in april we have received a very positive response from our customers and are now marketing our products under the new wegener brand 
it is anticipated that revenues and operating performance for the first quarter of fiscal will improve substantially compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal although no assurances may be given and order visibility is limited  we believe we will record sufficient new orders in fiscal to achieve increased revenues and fiscal year profitability compared to fiscal financial position and liquidity we have no long term debt or line of credit borrowings outstanding at september  our cash and cash equivalents were  at september  our  bank loan facility  which is subject to availability advance formulas based on eligible accounts receivable  import letter of credit commitment balances and inventories  is currently being used to support import letters of credit issued to our offshore manufacturers  which at september  amounted to  at september   approximately  net of the outstanding letters of credit was available to borrow under the advance formulas 
we believe that the loan facility along with cash and cash equivalent balances will be sufficient to support operations over the next twelve months 
beginning in the first half of fiscal  we expect that  from time to time  we will use borrowings on the line of credit to support operations 
we expect bookings for new products to result in increased revenues during fiscal  which could require an increase in the credit limit primarily to support increases in import letter of credit balances 
while no assurances may be given  we believe additional credit limits would be made available under the existing line of credit to support borrowing requirements resulting from increased revenues 
should the bookings and revenue for the new products not materialize  we are committed to reducing operating costs to bring them in line with revenue levels 
see the liquidity and capital resources section on page for further discussion 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the components of the results of operations as a percentage of revenue year ended september  august  august  revenue cost of products sold gross margin selling  general  and administrative research development operating income loss interest expense 
interest income earnings loss before income taxes income tax expense benefit net earnings loss net loss for the year ended september   was  or per diluted share  compared to net earnings of  or less than per diluted share for the year ended august   and net earnings of  or per diluted share for the year ended august  revenues for fiscal decreased  or  to  from  in fiscal direct broadcast satellite dbs revenues including service revenues in fiscal decreased  or  to  from  in fiscal telecom and custom product revenues decreased  or  in fiscal to  from  in fiscal revenues and order backlog are subject to the timing of significant orders from customers  and as a result revenue levels may fluctuate on a quarterly and yearly basis 
dbs revenues and bookings were adversely impacted by delayed purchasing decisions in the digital satellite transmission market and particularly by a longer than expected sales cycle for the ipump media server and dtv series products 
fiscal revenues included shipments of network equipment to roberts communications for network upgrades and expansion  and to ascent media for new cable network applications and expansion of private video networks 
shipments to ascent media included deliveries of ipump media servers for their network applications 
the telecom and custom products group revenue decrease in fiscal was primarily due to completion of shipments of commercial insertion equipment in fiscal to a cable television operator 
revenues for fiscal decreased  or  to  from  in fiscal direct broadcast satellite dbs revenues including service revenues in fiscal decreased  or  to  from  in fiscal telecom and custom product revenues increased  or  in fiscal to  from  in fiscal the decrease in dbs revenues in fiscal was primarily a result of a lower backlog of orders at the beginning of fiscal compared to the beginning of fiscal revenues were adversely impacted by delayed purchasing decisions in the digital satellite transmission market and delayed product introductions by the company 
fiscal revenues included shipments of network equipment to roberts communications to provide television coverage of horseracing to off track betting venues throughout the united states  and shipments of digital receivers to fox digital and fox sports net for their broadcast and cable television networks 
revenues from these two customers decreased approximately  in fiscal compared to fiscal decreases in fiscal revenues were partially offset by approximately  of earned deposits 
the telecom and custom products group revenue increase in fiscal was primarily due to an increase in orders from a distributor to provide commercial insertion equipment to a cable television operator 
wci s backlog of orders scheduled to ship within months was  at september   compared to  at august   and  at august  the total multi year backlog at september   was approximately  our backlog has been impacted by delayed purchasing decisions in the digital satellite transmission market  a longer than expected sales cycle for the ipump media server and dtv series products  and delayed timing of new product introductions by the company 
approximately  of the september   backlog is expected to ship during fiscal three customers accounted for of our backlog at september  and for of the backlog expected to ship during fiscal sales to a relatively small number of major customers have typically comprised a majority of our revenues and that trend is expected to continue 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  segment information and significant customers 
future revenues are subject to the timing of significant orders from customers and are difficult to forecast 
as a result  we expect future revenue levels and operating results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
it is anticipated that revenues and operating performance for the first quarter of fiscal will improve substantially compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal although no assurances may be given and order visibility is limited  we believe we will record sufficient new orders in fiscal to achieve increased revenues and fiscal year profitability compared to fiscal international sales are generated through a direct sales organization and through foreign distributors 
international sales were  or of revenues in fiscal compared to  or of revenues in fiscal  and  or of revenues in fiscal international shipments are generally project specific and revenues  therefore  are subject to variations from year to year based on the timing of customer orders 
all international sales are denominated in us dollars 
additional financial information on geographic areas is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements 
gross profit as a percent of sales was in fiscal compared to in fiscal  and in fiscal gross profit margin dollars decreased  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal fiscal gross profit margin dollars amounted to  the decrease in margin percentages and dollars in fiscal was mainly due to lower revenues  an increase of  in capitalized software amortization expense and an increase of  in inventory reserve expenses 
the product mix for fiscal included increased amounts of lower margin reseller uplink equipment compared to fiscal reseller equipment comprised approximately of sales in fiscal compared to of sales in fiscal selling  general  and administrative sg a expenses decreased  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal as a percentage of revenues  sg a expenses were of revenues in fiscal and in fiscal sg a expenses in fiscal included an insurance reimbursement of  for a portion of corporate legal costs expensed in fiscal related to defending the company against an unsolicited  hostile takeover attempt by radyne comstream  inc sg a expenses in fiscal included  in corporate legal and professional fees related to defending the company against the unsolicited hostile takeover attempt by radyne comstream  inc and related litigation 
wci s sg a expenses increased  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal sales and marketing salary expenses increased  due to an increase in personnel  marketing expenses increased  due to increased sales activity related to new products 
sg a expenses increased  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal as a percentage of revenues  sg a expenses were of revenues in fiscal and in fiscal sg a expenses in fiscal included the  in corporate legal and professional fees related to defending the company against an unsolicited hostile takeover attempt by radyne comstream  inc and related litigation 
these expenses were partially offset by decreases in certain expenses of  primarily depreciation  bad debt provisions and outside sales agent commissions 
general corporate expenses included in sg a expense were approximately   and  in fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease in fiscal corporate expenses was primarily due to a decrease in legal and professional fees incurred in fiscal related to the takeover attempt 
fiscal included an insurance reimbursement of  for a portion of the fiscal corporate legal costs 
research and development expenditures  including capitalized software development costs  were  or of revenues in fiscal   or of revenues in fiscal  and  or of revenues in fiscal the increase in expenditures in fiscal compared to fiscal was due to increases in engineering consulting expenses primarily related to the development of ipump media server and the dtv series products 
the increase in expenditures in fiscal compared to fiscal was due to increases in engineering consulting costs  prototype parts expenses and personnel costs primarily related to the development of ipump media server  unity digital receiver  and the dtv series products 
software development costs totaling   and  were capitalized during fiscal  and  respectively 
the increases in capitalized software costs during fiscal compared to  and fiscal compared to fiscal  are due to increased expenditures on the compel network control software  the ipump media server  unity and dtv series products 
research and development expenses  excluding capitalized software development costs  were  or of revenues in fiscal   or of revenues in fiscal  and  or of revenues in fiscal we expect fiscal research and development expenditures to approximate fiscal levels as we continue to develop and enhance dbs products 
interest expense was  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal and  in fiscal interest expense in fiscal years  and was principally associated with letters of credit commitments and bank float charges on lockbox collections 
the increase in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to an increase in the average outstanding letter of credit commitment balances 
we believe that interest expense in fiscal will increase compared to fiscal as a result of expected increases in letter of credit commitment balances and line of credit borrowings  as well as increases in prime rates 
interest income was  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal and  in fiscal the decrease in fiscal compared to fiscal was mainly due to lower average balances of cash and cash equivalents  which was offset by a one time benefit of  related to the collection of a trade accounts receivable 
the increase in fiscal compared to fiscal was mainly due to higher average outstanding balances of cash and cash equivalents 
fiscal income tax benefit of  was comprised of deferred federal and state tax benefits of  and  respectively 
net deferred tax assets increased  to  at september  the increase was principally due to increases in net operating loss carryforwards  offset by reductions of general business and foreign tax credits of  which expired september  realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on generating sufficient future taxable income prior to the expiration of the loss and credit carryforwards 
at september   we had a federal net operating loss carryforward of  which expires beginning fiscal through additionally  we had an alternative minimum tax credit of  and state income tax credits of  expiring in fiscal although realization is not assured  we believe it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax assets will be realized based on our backlog and financial projections 
the amount considered realizable could be reduced if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced 
fiscal income tax expense of  was comprised of a current state income tax benefit of  and deferred federal and state tax benefits of  and  respectively 
the fiscal state income tax benefits were favorably impacted primarily by state income tax credits of  related to georgia retraining credits 
net deferred tax assets increased  to  at august  from  at august  the increase was principally due to state income tax credits of  and increases in net operating loss carryforwards 
fiscal income tax expense of  was comprised of a current federal income tax benefit of  from receipt of alternative minimum tax refunds as a result of federal income tax law changes and deferred federal and state income tax expenses of  and  respectively 
a reconciliation of our effective income tax rate as compared to the statutory us income tax rate is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies certain accounting policies are very important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most subjective or difficult judgements 
these policies are as follows revenue recognition our revenue recognition policies are in compliance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements and eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an agreement with the customer exists  products are shipped or title passes pursuant to the terms of the agreement with the customer  the amount due from the customer is fixed or determinable  collectibility is reasonably assured  and there are no significant future performance obligations 
service revenues are recognized at the time of performance 
revenues from separate service maintenance agreements are recognized ratably over the term of the agreements 
we recognize revenue in certain circumstances before delivery has occurred commonly referred to as bill and hold transactions 
in such circumstances  among other things  risk of ownership has passed to the buyer  the buyer has made a written fixed commitment to purchase the finished goods  the buyer has requested the finished goods be held for future delivery as scheduled and designated by them  and no additional performance obligations exist by us 
for these transactions  the finished goods are segregated from inventory and normal billing and credit terms are granted 
for the year ended september   revenues to one customer in the amount of  were recorded prior to delivery as bill and hold transactions 
at september   accounts receivable for these revenues amounted to  and were paid in full subsequent to september  these policies require management  at the time of the transaction  to assess whether the amounts due are fixed or determinable  collection is reasonably assured and no future performance obligations exist 
these assessments are based on the terms of the agreement with the customer  past history and creditworthiness of the customer 
if management determines that collection is not reasonably assured or future performance obligations exist  revenue recognition is deferred until these conditions are satisfied 
our principal sources of revenues are from the sales of various satellite communications equipment 
embedded in our products is internally developed software of varying applications 
historically  we have not sold or marketed our software separately or otherwise licensed our software apart from the related communications equipment 
should we begin to market or sell software whereby it is more than an incidental component of the hardware  then we would recognize software license revenue in accordance with sop no 
 software revenue recognition as amended by sop no 
 software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
inventory reserves inventories are valued at the lower of cost at standard  which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis or market 
inventories include the cost of raw materials  labor and manufacturing overhead 
we make inventory reserve provisions to properly reflect inventory value based on a review of inventory quantities on hand  sales forecasts  new products being developed and technology changes 
these reserves are to provide for items that are potentially slow moving  excess or obsolete 
changes in market conditions  lower than expected customer demand and rapidly changing technology could result in additional obsolete and slow moving inventory that is unsaleable or saleable at reduced prices  which could require additional inventory reserve provisions 
at september   inventories  net of reserve provisions  amounted to capitalized software costs software development costs are capitalized subsequent to establishing technological feasibility 
capitalized costs are amortized based on the larger of the amounts computed using a the ratio that current gross revenues for each product bears to the total of current and anticipated future gross revenues for that product or b the straight line method over the remaining estimated economic life of the product 
expected future revenues and estimated economic lives are subject to revisions due to market conditions  technology changes and other factors resulting in shortfalls of expected revenues or reduced economic lives  which could result in additional amortization expense or write offs 
at september   capitalized software costs  net of accumulated amortization  amounted to  deferred tax asset valuation allowance deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences  net operating loss carryforwards and credit carryforwards  if it is more likely than not that the tax benefits will be realized 
realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent on generating sufficient future taxable income prior to the expiration of the loss and credit carryforwards 
although realization is not assured  we believe it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax assets will be realized based on our backlog and financial projections 
the amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable  however  could be reduced if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced 
any reduction in the realizable value of deferred tax assets would result in a charge to income tax expense in the period such determination was made 
in addition  any reductions in corporate federal tax rates would reduce the carrying value of deferred tax assets 
each reduction in corporate federal tax rates would reduce deferred tax assets by approximately  based on the deferred tax asset balances at september  at september   deferred tax assets amounted to  including  in net operating loss carryforwards which expire in fiscal through and state tax credits of  expiring in fiscal accounts receivable valuation we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
at september   accounts receivable net of allowances for doubtful accounts amounted to  liquidity and capital resources at september   our primary sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents of  and a  bank loan facility 
cash and cash equivalents decreased  in fiscal we have no long term debt or line of credit borrowings outstanding at september  our bank loan facility  which is subject to availability advance formulas based on eligible accounts receivable  import letter of credit commitment balances and inventories  is currently being used to support import letters of credit issued to our offshore manufacturers  which at september  amounted to  at september   approximately  net of the outstanding letters of credit was available to borrow under the advance formulas 
we believe that the loan facility along with cash and cash equivalent balances will be sufficient to support our operations over the next twelve months 
beginning in the first half of fiscal  we expect that  from time to time  we will use borrowings on the line of credit to support operations 
we expect bookings for new products to result in increased revenues during fiscal  which could require an increase in the credit limit primarily to support increases in import letter of credit balances 
while no assurances may be given  wci believes additional credit limits would be made available under the existing line of credit to support borrowing requirements resulting from increased revenues 
should the bookings and revenues for the new products not materialize  we are committed to reducing operating costs to bring them in line with revenue levels

capitalized software expenditures were incurred for the development of compel network control software  the ipump media server  unity and dtv series products 
property and equipment expenditures were for planned additions of principally manufacturing and engineering test equipment 
fiscal expenditures for investing activities are expected to approximate fiscal levels 
cash provided by financing activities was  in fiscal cash used by financing activities was  in fiscal and  in fiscal in fiscal  financing activities used cash of  for scheduled repayments of long term obligations and  for loan facility fees  and provided  of cash from the exercise of stock options 
net accounts receivable decreased  to  at september   from  at august   compared to  at august  the decrease in fiscal was primarily due to lower revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal compared to the same period of fiscal the allowance for doubtful accounts was  at september    at august  and  at august  write offs were  in fiscal   in fiscal and  in fiscal recoveries in fiscal were  increases to the allowance and charges to general and administrative expense were in fiscal   in fiscal and  in fiscal customer deposits increased  to  at september   from  at august   primarily due to two customer bookings scheduled to ship in fiscal customer deposits vary with the timing and terms of customer bookings 
inventory before reserves increased  to  at september   from  at august  the increase was primarily due to deliveries in the fourth quarter of fiscal of ipump media servers and unity receivers from offshore manufacturers which are expected to ship in the first half of fiscal during fiscal  inventory reserves were increased by provisions charged to cost of sales of  the increase in the provision was to provide additional reserves for slower moving analog products  excess digital audio inventories  and potentially slow moving inventories of earlier generations of other digital products 
these products continue to sell but at reduced quantities 
inventory reserves were increased by provisions charged to cost of sales of  in fiscal and  in fiscal inventory reserves were decreased by write offs of  in fiscal   in fiscal and  in fiscal during fiscal  increases in inventories used cash of  during fiscal and  decreases in inventories provided cash of  and  respectively 
wci s bank loan facility provides a maximum available credit limit of  subject to availability advance formulas 
the loan facility matures on june   or upon demand and requires an annual facility fee of 
of the maximum credit limit 
the loan facility consists of a term loan and a revolving line of credit with a combined borrowing limit of  bearing interest at the bank s prime rate at september  
the term loan facility provides for a maximum of  for advances of up to of the cost of equipment acquisitions 
principal advances are payable monthly over months with a balloon payment due at maturity 
the revolving line of credit is subject to availability advance formulas of against eligible accounts receivable  of eligible raw materials inventories  of eligible work in process kit inventories  to of eligible finished goods inventories and of import letter of credit commitment balances 
the loan is secured by a first lien on substantially all of wci s assets and guaranteed by wegener corporation 
at september   no balances were outstanding on the revolving line of credit or the equipment term loan portions of the loan facility 
the loan facility is currently being used to support import letters of credit issued to offshore manufacturers  which at september  amounted to  at september   approximately  net of outstanding letters of credit  was available to borrow under the advance formulas 
we are required to maintain a minimum tangible net worth with annual increases at each fiscal year end commencing with fiscal year  retain certain key employees  maintain certain financial ratios  and are precluded from paying dividends 
at september   we were in compliance with all loan facility covenants 
we believe that the loan facility along with cash and cash equivalent balances will be sufficient to support operations through fiscal in addition  at september   we had land and buildings and improvements with a cost basis of  which had no mortgage balances outstanding 
we have three manufacturing and purchasing agreements for certain finished goods inventories 
at september   outstanding purchase commitments under these agreements amounted to  pursuant to the above agreements  at september   we had outstanding letters of credit in the amount of a summary of our long term contractual obligations as of september  consisted of payments due by period contractual obligations total one year years years operating leases     purchase commitments    total     impact of inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on revenues or expenses during the past three fiscal years 
impact of recently issued accounting standards in january  the eitf released issue no 
 eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  which addressed certain aspects of the accounting by a vendor for arrangements under which it will perform multiple revenue generating activities 
specifically  eitf addresses whether an arrangement contains more than one unit of accounting and the measurement and allocation to the separate units of accounting in the arrangement 
eitf is effective for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact our financial position or results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures in its statement of financial position certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability or an asset in some circumstances because that financial instrument embodies an obligation of the issuer 
many of such instruments were previously classified as equity 
the statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june   except for mandatory redeemable financial instruments of nonpublic entities 
on november   the fasb deferred the classification and measurement provisions of sfas no 
as they apply to certain mandatory redeemable non controlling interests 
this deferral is expected to remain in effect while these provisions are further evaluated by the fasb 
we have not entered into any financial instruments covered by this statement and the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or results of operations 
outlook issues and uncertainties the market for our products is characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards and frequent product introductions 
product introductions are generally characterized by increased functionality and better quality  sometimes at reduced prices 
the introduction of products embodying new technology may render existing products obsolete and unmarketable or marketable at substantially reduced prices 
our ability to successfully develop and introduce on a timely basis new and enhanced products that embody new technology  and achieve levels of functionality and price acceptable to the market  will be a significant factor in our ability to grow and remain competitive 
if we are unable  for technological or other reasons  to develop competitive products in a timely manner in response to changes in the industry  our business and operating results will be materially and adversely affected 
wci competes with companies that have substantially greater resources and a larger number of products  as well as with small specialized companies 
through relationships with technology partners and original equipment manufacturer oem suppliers  we are positioned to provide end to end solutions to our customers 
competition in the market for our mpeg broadcast television electronics products  including digital video equipment  is driven by timeliness  performance and price 
our broadcast digital video products in production are competitively priced  with unique  desirable features 
the compel network control system meets customer needs by providing regionalization of receiver control and spot advertisement 
due to the large number of potential end users  both small and large competitors continue to emerge 
we believe we are positioned to capitalize on the market trends in this business through careful development of its product and market strategies  which have proven successful in increasing revenues from this sector 
in the cable television market we believe that the competitive position for many of our products is strong 
however  the unity product family competes with significant and established firms 
other products for cable television include proprietary cueing and network control devices 
competition for radio network products  including our digital audio products  is very aggressive and pricing is very competitive 
we believe that our continued success in all of our markets will depend on aggressive marketing and product development 
the demand for digital products is being driven by the high cost of satellite capacity and increasing demand for video and multi media content 
the digital conversion of major networks is expected to continue  but it remains difficult to predict the precise timing and number of customers converting to digital 
we believe the market as a whole has considerable built up demand for digital technology 
although no assurances can be given  we expect to directly benefit from this increase in demand 
there may be fluctuations in our revenues and operating results from quarter to quarter due to several factors  including the timing of significant orders from customers and the timing of new product introductions by us 
we have invested a significant amount of financial resources to acquire certain raw materials  to incur direct labor and to contract to have specific outplant procedures performed on inventory in process 
we purchased this inventory based upon previously known backlog and anticipated future sales given existing knowledge of the marketplace 
our inventory reserve of  at september   is to provide for items that are potentially slow moving  excess or obsolete 
changes in market conditions  lower than expected customer demand and rapidly changing technology could result in additional obsolete and slow moving inventory that is unsaleable or saleable at reduced prices 
no estimate can be made of a range of amounts of loss from obsolescence that might occur should our sales efforts not be successful 
sales to a relatively small number of major customers have typically comprised a majority of our revenues  and that trend is expected to continue throughout fiscal and beyond 
future revenues are subject to the timing of significant orders from customers and are difficult to forecast 
as a result  future revenues may fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
three customers accounted for of the backlog at september  and for of the backlog scheduled to ship during fiscal our gross margin percentage is subject to variations based on the product mix sold in any period and on sales volumes 
start up costs associated with new product introductions could adversely impact costs and future margins 
we are very focused on controlling both direct and indirect manufacturing costs and other operating expenses 
these costs will be adjusted as necessary if revenues do not increase as planned 
management believes that digital compression technology may be profitably employed to create increased demand for our satellite receiving equipment if those products are manufactured in a high volume  standardized production environment 
certain raw materials  video sub components and licensed video processing technologies used in existing and future products are currently available from single or limited sources 
although we believe that all single source components are currently available in adequate quantities  there can be no assurance that shortages or unanticipated delivery interruptions will not develop in the future 
any disruption or termination of supply of certain single source components or technologies could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
we have made significant investments in capitalized software principally related to digital audio and video products 
at september   capitalized software costs were  these costs are amortized based on the larger of the amounts computed using a the ratio that current gross revenues for each product bears to the total of current and anticipated future gross revenues for that product  or b the straight line method over the remaining estimated economic life of the product 
expected future revenues and estimated economic lives are subject to revisions due to market conditions  technology changes and other factors resulting in shortfalls of expected revenues or reduced economic lives 
the industry in which we operate is subject to rapid technological advances and frequent product introductions 
we expect to remain committed to research and development expenditures as required to compete effectively and maintain pace with the rapid technological changes in the communications industry and to support innovative engineering and design for future products 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our revolving line of credit facility and cash equivalents 
the interest rate on certain advances under the line of credit and term loan facility fluctuates with the bank s prime rate 
there were no borrowings outstanding at september   subject to variable interest rate fluctuations 
at september   cash equivalents consisted of bank commercial paper in the amount of  the cash equivalents have maturities of less than three months and therefore are subject to minimal market risk 
we do not enter into derivative financial instruments 
all sales and purchases are denominated in us dollars
