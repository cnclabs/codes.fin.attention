the financial information in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are presented in whole dollars 
general ultralife batteries  inc develops  manufactures and markets a wide range of standard and customized lithium primary non rechargeable  lithium ion and lithium polymer rechargeable batteries for use in a wide array of applications 
the company believes that its technologies allow the company to offer batteries that are flexibly configured  lightweight and generally achieve longer operating time than many competing batteries currently available 
the company has focused on manufacturing a family of lithium primary batteries for military  industrial and consumer applications  which it believes is one of the most comprehensive lines of lithium manganese dioxide primary batteries commercially available 
the company also supplies rechargeable lithium ion and lithium polymer batteries for use in portable electronic applications 
effective december   the company changed its fiscal year end from june to december the financial results presented in this report reflecting the calendar year ended december  are referred to as 
the financial results presented in this report reflecting the six month period ended december  are referred to as transition 
the financial results presented in this report reflecting the full twelve month fiscal periods that ended june prior to transition are referred to as fiscal years 
for instance  the year ended june  is referred to as fiscal  and the year ended june  is referred to as fiscal 
the financial results pertaining to the twelve month period ended december  and the six month period ended december  were derived from unaudited financial statements  due to the company s change in its fiscal year end 
the company reports its results in three operating segments primary batteries  rechargeable batteries  and technology contracts 
the primary batteries segment includes volt  cylindrical and various other non rechargeable specialty batteries 
the rechargeable batteries segment includes the company s lithium polymer and lithium ion rechargeable batteries 
the technology contracts segment includes revenues and related costs associated with various government and military development contracts 
the company looks at its segment performance at the gross margin level  and does not allocate research and development or selling  general and administrative costs against the segments 
all other items that do not specifically relate to these three segments and are not considered in the performance of these segments are considered to be corporate charges 
currently  the company does not experience significant seasonal trends in primary battery revenues and does not have enough sales history on the rechargeable batteries to determine if there is seasonality 
results of operations twelve months ended december  compared with the twelve months ended december  months ended increase decrease sales    cost of sales    gross margin    operating expenses    operating income loss    other income expense  net    income taxes   net income loss    net income loss per share  basic net income loss per share diluted weighted average shares outstanding basic    weighted average shares outstanding diluted    revenues 
total revenues of the company for the twelve months ended december   increased  or to  over the twelve months ended december  primary batteries accounted for  of this change  increasing from  for the twelve months ended december  to  for the same twelve month period in  mainly due to strong sales of hirate batteries related to increased demand for the company s large cylindrical ba battery sold to military customers  and higher volt sales 
rechargeable battery sales increased  or  from  in to  in  primarily due to increased product offerings  including the rechargeable version of the ba and battery charging units 
technology contract revenues increased  or to  for the year ended december   resulting from a military development contract with the us army for rechargeable batteries and battery charging units 
cost of products sold 
cost of products sold increased  to  for the year ended december  as a result of the increase in revenues 
consolidated cost of products sold as a percentage of total revenue improved from approximately for the twelve months ended december  to for the twelve months ended december  consolidated gross margins improved from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  in the primary battery segment  the cost of batteries sold increased  from  in the year ended december  to  in  mainly related to increased sales volume 
as a percent of total primary battery sales  the cost of primary products sold decreased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  mainly due to increased production and improved manufacturing efficiencies 
the corresponding primary gross margins were in and in in the rechargeable battery segment  the cost of products sold increased  from  in the year ended december  to  in while rechargeable product sales rose  the costs of products sold rose only a modest in comparison 
the most notable reason for this improvement related to the cost reduction program that the company initiated during late and early  as well as lower depreciation charges related to the fixed asset impairment recorded in june technology contract cost of sales increased  or  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december   as a result of the increase in revenues 
technology contracts cost of sales as a percentage of revenue was for the year ended december   compared with in  primarily due to differences in gross margins of current year contracts compared with prior year contracts 
operating and other expenses 
total operating expenses increased  or  to  for the year ended december  up from  for the year ended december   excluding a  asset impairment charge recorded in june of in general  this increase related to the higher costs required to support the significant growth of the company 
operating and other expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased from in  excluding the impairment charge  to in research and development costs decreased to  for the twelve months ended december  as compared to  for the same period in the decrease is largely attributable to a decline in the development efforts for polymer rechargeable batteries associated with the company s shift in its strategy during selling  general and administrative expenses increased  or  from  in to  in selling and marketing expenses increased  or  as added investments were made relating to additional customer service and sales support needed to keep pace with the rapid sales growth 
general and administrative expenses increased  or  due to higher professional and legal fees  and personnel costs 
other income expense 
interest expense net increased  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  this change was a result of higher revolving loan balances in equity loss in ultralife taiwan  inc  uti was  in the year ended december  compared with zero in the same period of this change resulted mainly from an october change in the method of accounting for the company s investment in uti  from the equity method of accounting to the cost method of accounting 
in october  the company sold a portion of its equity investment in uti  reducing its ownership interest from approximately to approximately  resulting in the change in the method of accounting 
subsequent to the completion of this transaction  uti has raised additional equity capital and the company s ownership interest in uti has declined to approximately as of december  in connection with the sale  the company recorded a  gain in october during  the company recognized a  gain from the forgiveness of a government sponsored debt grant agreement dated in as the company fulfilled its obligation to increase employment levels under a government sponsored loan  and the loan was forgiven 
miscellaneous income  primarily consisting of foreign exchange transaction gains and losses  decreased  to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  income taxes 
the company recorded an income tax provision in of  compared with zero in while the company had significant net operating loss carryforwards nols as of december  related to past years cumulative losses  it is subject to a us alternative minimum tax where nols can offset only of alternative minimum taxable income 
net income 
net income was  or per diluted common share  for the year ended december  compared with a net loss of  or per share  for the year ended december   primarily as a result of the reasons described above 
average common shares outstanding used to compute basic earnings per share increased from  in to  in mainly due to various common equity transactions during and  and stock option exercises during  offset in part by the reacquisition of shares from uti that resulted from the company s sale of a portion of its interest in uti in october the positive earnings in  the increase in the company s stock price during and the related impact from in the money stock options and warrants resulted in an additional  shares for the average diluted shares outstanding computation in six months ended december  compared with the six months ended december months ended increase decrease sales    cost of sales    gross margin    operating expenses    operating loss    other income expense  net    net loss    net loss per share  basic net loss per share  diluted weighted average shares outstanding basic    weighted average shares outstanding diluted    revenues 
total revenues of the company increased  from  for the six months ended december  to  for the six months ended december  primary battery sales increased  from  for the six months ended december  to  for the six months ended december  the increase in primary battery sales was primarily due to new shipments of large cylindrical batteries  particularly the company s ba battery sold to military customers  and an increase in hirate battery sales due to stronger demand from the uk ministry of defence 
these increases were offset in part by a decline in sales of small cylindrical batteries  mainly related to a fulfillment of orders from military for ba batteries used for pilot down radio applications 
rechargeable battery sales were consistent year over year 
technology contract revenues decreased  from  to  due to the scheduled reduction of certain nonrenewable government contracts  which concluded in june cost of products sold 
cost of products sold decreased  from  for the six months ended december  to  for the six months ended december  consolidated cost of products sold as a percentage of total revenue improved from approximately to for the six months ended december  consolidated gross margins improved from a negative of sales in the six months ended december  to a positive for the same six months in in october and november  the company realigned its resources to address changing market conditions and to better meet customer demand in areas of the business that were growing 
a majority of employees affected by this realignment were re deployed from the rechargeable segment and support functions into open direct labor positions in the primary segment  due to the significantly growing demand for primary batteries from the military 
again in february  the company took further actions to reduce costs in its ongoing effort to improve liquidity and to bring costs more in line with current and near term anticipated revenues 
these cost reductions included employee terminations and salary reductions  discontinuance of certain employee benefits and other cost savings initiatives in general and administrative areas 
approximately one half of these cost savings reduced cost of products sold  with the other half reducing r d and selling  general and administrative costs 
severance costs associated with these actions were incurred in the period of the force reductions  although they were not material 
in total  these actions generated total cost savings of more than  per quarter from the expense run rate that the company experienced during its september quarter 
in the primary battery segment  the cost of batteries sold increased  from  in the six months ended december  to  in the same six month period in  mainly related to increased sales volume 
as a percent of total primary battery sales  cost of primary products sold rose from for the six months ended december  to for the year ended june  the corresponding decline in primary gross margins from in to in resulted from lower sales of small cylindrical batteries  and start up costs for the large cylindrical battery business  offset in part by higher margins in volt batteries due mainly to improving manufacturing efficiencies 
in the rechargeable battery segment  the cost of products sold decreased  in the six months ended december  from  in the six months ended december  to  in the same six month period in in general  the decrease in costs from to primarily resulted from the implementation of cost savings initiatives referred to previously  as well as lower depreciation charges related to a million write down of rechargeable fixed assets that the company recorded in june technology contracts cost of sales decreased  or approximately  from  for the six months ended december  to  for the six months ended december   in line with the decrease in revenues 
technology contracts cost of sales as a percentage of revenue was for that six month period  consistent with the prior year 
operating and other expenses 
total operating and other expenses decreased  from  for the six months ended december  to  for the six months ended december  mainly as a result of cost savings initiatives implemented in late and early operating and other expenses as a percentage of revenue improved from for the six months ended december  to for the same six month period in research and development costs decreased  or from  for the six months ended december  to  for the same six months in this decrease was mainly due to the cost savings initiatives and lower depreciation charges resulting from the write down of rechargeable equipment in june selling  general and administration expenses decreased  or  from  for the six months ended december  to  for the six months ended december  selling and marketing expenses declined  from the six month period in over as a result of a more targeted sales coverage strategy using fewer resources and lower marketing and advertising costs 
general and administrative expenses declined  mainly due to lower executive severance costs and cost savings actions that reduced personnel and other related expenses 
other income expense 
interest income decreased  from  for the six months ended december  to  for the same six months in this decrease is mainly the result of lower average balances of cash and investment securities  as well as lower interest rates 
interest expense decreased  from  in to  in as a result of lower average balances of debt 
equity loss in uti was  in the six month period ended december  compared with equity earnings of  in the same period in this change resulted mainly from higher reported operating losses at uti 
miscellaneous income expense increased from income of  in the six months ended december  to income of  in the six months ended december   primarily as a result of unrealized gains on foreign currency transactions due mainly to the strengthening of the uk pounds sterling relative to the us dollar 
in october  the company sold a portion of its equity investment in ultralife taiwan  inc uti  reducing its ownership interest from approximately to approximately 
in exchange  the company received total consideration of million in cash and the return of  shares of ultralife common stock 
as a result of this transaction  the company recorded a gain on the disposition of its uti investment of  net losses 
the consolidated net loss for the six months ended december  was  or per share compared with a loss of  or per share  for the six months ended december   primarily as a result of the reasons described above

total revenues of the company increased  from  for the year ended june  to  for the year ended june  primary battery sales increased  from  for the year ended june  to  for the year ended june  the increase in primary battery sales was primarily due to growth in cylindrical battery sales  particularly to military customers  and higher volt battery sales 
rechargeable battery sales increased modestly from  for the year ended june  to  for the year ended june   as the company broadened its strategy in the latter portion of fiscal from simply selling polymer batteries it manufactures to selling a rechargeable solution that encompasses sourcing cells from other lithium battery manufacturers and assembling them to meet customer needs 
technology contract revenues decreased  from  to  due to the scheduled reduction of certain nonrenewable government contracts  which concluded in fiscal cost of products sold 
cost of products sold increased  from  for the year ended june  to  for the year ended june  consolidated cost of products sold as a percentage of total revenue improved from approximately to for the year ended june  consolidated gross margins improved from a negative in fiscal of sales to a positive in fiscal in october and november  the company realigned its resources to address changing market conditions and to better meet customer demand in areas of the business that were growing

these cost reductions included employee terminations and salary reductions  discontinuance of certain employee benefits and other cost savings initiatives in general and administrative areas 
overall  the company reduced its workforce by more than during the year 
approximately one half of these cost savings reduced cost of products sold  with the other half reducing r d and selling  general and administrative costs 
severance costs associated with these actions were incurred in the period of the force reductions  although they were not material 
in total  the actions taken during fiscal generated total cost savings of more than  per quarter from the expense run rate that the company experienced during its first quarter of fiscal in the primary battery segment  the cost of batteries sold increased  from  in to  in  mainly related to increased sales volume 
as a percent of total primary battery sales  cost of primary products sold improved from for the year ended june  to for the year ended june   reflecting improved manufacturing efficiencies related to higher volumes and the impact from certain of the cost savings initiatives referred to above  as well as the ongoing positive effects from the implementation of lean manufacturing disciplines 
in the rechargeable battery segment  the cost of products sold decreased  in fiscal from  in fiscal to  in during fiscal  in anticipation of significant increases in rechargeable sales volume  the company added resources to prepare for this expected growth 
as economic conditions changed during fiscal  the company reacted and reduced its resources accordingly by realigning its resources and reducing manpower as described above 
in general  the decrease in costs from to primarily resulted from the cost savings initiatives that were implemented during the year 
technology contracts cost of sales decreased  or approximately  from  for the year ended june  to  for the year ended june   in line with the decrease in revenues 
technology contracts cost of sales as a percentage of revenue was in  consistent with the prior year 
operating and other expenses 
in june  the company recorded a fixed asset impairment charge of  this impairment charge related to a write down of long lived assets in the company s rechargeable production operations  reflecting a change in the company s strategy 
changes in external economic conditions culminated in june  reflecting a slowdown in the mobile electronics marketplace and a realization that near term business opportunities utilizing the high volume rechargeable production equipment had dissipated 
these changes caused the company to shift away from high volume polymer rechargeable battery production to higher value  lower volume opportunities 
the company s redefined strategy eliminates the need for its high volume production line that had been built mainly to manufacture nokia cell phone replacement batteries 
the new strategy is a three pronged approach 
first  the company will manufacture in house for the higher value  lower volume polymer rechargeable opportunities 
second  the company will utilize its affiliate in taiwan  ultralife taiwan  inc  as a source for both polymer and lithium ion cells 
third  the company will look to other rechargeable cell manufacturers as sources for cells that the company can then assemble into completed battery packs 
in the future  the impairment of the rechargeable fixed assets will result in lower depreciation charges of approximately  per year 
total operating and other expenses increased  from  for the year ended june  to  for the year ended june  excluding the impairment charge  operating and other expenses increased  from  in to  in  mainly as a result of higher research and development expenses 
operating and other expenses as a percentage of revenue  excluding the impairment charge  improved from for the year ended june  to for the year ended june  research and development costs increased  or from  for the year ended june  to  for the year ended june  this increase was mainly due to higher costs related to the development of new cylindrical batteries for the military applications  as the company focused more extensively on this significant market opportunity 
r d expenditures related to rechargeable battery development diminished during the year as a result of the cost savings actions discussed previously 
the company anticipates that r d costs overall will decline significantly in fiscal as compared with due to the sizeable reduction in rechargeable development efforts and the expected near term transition of the new cylindrical battery development to manufacturing during fiscal selling  general and administration expenses decreased  approximately  from  for the year ended june  to  for the year ended june   even though revenues rose 
selling and marketing expenses declined  from fiscal to fiscal as a result of a more targeted sales coverage strategy using fewer resources and lower marketing and advertising costs 
general and administrative expenses  on the other hand  rose  as a result of higher insurance expenses and certain severance costs pertaining to an executive employment agreement incurred in conjunction with the company s resource realignment during the second fiscal quarter 
other income expense 
interest income decreased  from  for the year ended june  to  for the year ended june  this decrease is mainly the result of lower average balances of cash and investment securities  as well as lower interest rates 
interest expense decreased  from  in to  in as a result of lower average balances of debt 
equity loss in uti was  in fiscal compared with a loss of  in fiscal the fiscal results included a  favorable adjustment recorded in july to correct cumulative net gains pertaining to the manner in which the company accounted for this equity investment in fiscal and fiscal the company determined that this cumulative adjustment was not significant enough to warrant a restatement for those periods 
miscellaneous income expense changed from an expense of  in to income of  in  primarily as a result of unrealized gains on foreign currency transactions due mainly to the strengthening of the uk pounds sterling relative to the us dollar 
net losses 
the consolidated net loss for the year ended june  was  or per share 
excluding the  impairment charge for long lived assets  the consolidated net loss improved  from a loss of  or per share  for the year ended june  to a loss of  or per share  for the year ended june   primarily as a result of the reasons described above 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows and general business matters as of december   cash equivalents totaled  excluding restricted cash of  during the twelve months ended december   the company used  of cash in operating activities as compared to  for the twelve months ended december  while net income plus depreciation and amortization amounted to a positive  during  uses of working capital more than offset this 
accounts receivable rose  related to the significant increase in sales  and inventories rose  due to the increased production activity for the recent military orders 
in the year ended december   the company used  to purchase property  plant and equipment  mainly as a result of the need to increase production capacity for cylindrical cells as demand from military customers grew significantly 
the company also loaned  to uti to help that company with some short term financing needs 
during  the company generated  in funds from financing activities 
the financing activities included inflows from a  private equity placement  stock option exercises that generated approximately  a  day note converted into shares of common stock in june  and the final payment of  that was received on a  government grant loan 
in addition  the company had accessed  of its revolving credit facilities during to finance working capital needs 
offsetting the inflows from financing activities was the payment of  for reductions in debt principal and capital leases 
inventory turnover for the year ended december  averaged turns  compared with turns in this metric is indicative of the company s continuing focus to improve purchasing procedures and inventory controls 
the company s days sales outstanding dsos was an average of days for  compared with an average of days for this improvement in dsos mainly reflects the significant increase in sales to the us military and the associated favorable impact from the timely payments made by them 
the company s order backlog at december  was approximately  of which approximately  related to orders from the us military which are expected to ship throughout as of december   the company had made commitments to purchase approximately  of production machinery and equipment which it expects to fund through operating cash flows 
debt and lease commitments at december   the company had a capital lease obligation outstanding of  for the company s newark  new york offices and manufacturing facilities 
the company has a  secured credit facility with it primary lending institution  which was initially established in june the financing agreement consists of a term loan component supported by fixed assets and a revolving credit facility component based on eligible net accounts receivable and eligible net inventory 
at december    was outstanding on the term loan 
the company pays  per quarter on the principal of the term loan plus interest  and there is no additional borrowing capacity on the term loan component above the current amount outstanding 
the revolving credit component comprises the remainder of the total potential borrowing capacity 
at december   the outstanding borrowings on the revolving credit facility were  the total amount available under the credit facility is reduced by outstanding letters of credit 
at december   the company had  outstanding on a letter of credit  supporting a  equipment lease 
the company s additional borrowing capacity under the revolver component of the credit facility as of december  was approximately  at december   the main financial covenant of the  credit facility required the company to maintain a net worth of at least approximately  this covenant increases each january by of the company s net income in the prior year 
at january   the minimum net worth covenant was approximately  at december   the company s net worth was  in compliance with this covenant 
loans under the  credit facility currently bear interest at prime based rates 
at december   the rate was 
the company also pays a facility fee of on the unused portion of the commitment 
the loan is collateralized by substantially all of the company s assets and the company is precluded from paying dividends under the terms of the agreement 
at december   the entire balance of outstanding borrowings under this credit facility was classified as a short term liability on the consolidated balance sheet 
see note for additional information 
this credit facility is scheduled to expire on june  the company is currently seeking and reviewing proposals from various lending institutions that would provide it with greater borrowing capacity  increased flexibility and lower borrowing costs 
the company plans to refinance this debt  or extend its current credit flexibility  before its current arrangement expires 
in march  the company established an operating lease line for the purpose of financing the acquisition of certain manufacturing equipment  which the company completed drawing upon in june the total amount of the lease line established was approximately  the company s quarterly lease payment is approximately  and the lease expires in july in conjunction with this lease  the company was initially required to maintain a  letter of credit  and the amount required decreases periodically over the term of the lease 
on january   the amount required for this letter of credit was reduced to  the letter of credit was issued by the company s primary lending institution  which diminishes the company s overall borrowing availability under the credit facility 
on april   ultralife batteries uk ltd  the company s wholly owned uk subsidiary  completed an agreement for a revolving credit facility with a commercial bank in the uk any borrowings against this credit facility are collateralized with that company s outstanding accounts receivable balances 
the maximum credit available to that company under the facility is approximately  this credit facility provides the company s uk operation with additional financing flexibility for its working capital needs 
at december   the outstanding borrowings under this revolver were equity transactions on march   the company completed a short term financing to help it meet certain working capital needs as the company was growing rapidly 
pursuant to the terms of the note  the three month   note  which accrued interest at per annum  was converted into  shares of common stock at per share on june  accrued interest was paid to the note holder on the maturity date 
on october   the company completed a private placement of  shares of unregistered common stock at a price of per share  for a total of  the net proceeds of the private placement   were used to advance funds to ultralife taiwan  inc uti  in which the company has an approximately ownership interest 
this transaction was completed in order to provide some short term financing to uti while they work to complete an additional equity infusion into uti to support their growth plans 
the transaction was recorded as a short term note receivable maturing on march  with interest accruing at per annum 
at march   the note remains unpaid and the company is renegotiating the possible extension of the maturity date of this note receivable while uti continues its efforts to raise additional equity capital 
if uti is successful in raising additional funds  the company currently expects to convert this note receivable into shares of uti common stock 
pursuant to the private placement agreement  the company filed an s registration statement with the sec to register the shares issued in the private placement for unrestricted trading 
the company accounts for its investment in uti using the cost method 
the carrying value of the company s ownership interest in uti reflected on the company s consolidated balance sheet as of december  was  the company does not guarantee the obligations of uti and is not required to provide any additional funding 
during fiscal  the company raised capital through two private equity transactions 
first  in july  the company completed a  private placement of  shares of its common stock at per share 
in conjunction with the offering  warrants to acquire up to  shares of common stock were granted 
the exercise price of the warrants is per share and the warrants have a five year term 
the second transaction occurred in april  when the company closed on a  private placement consisting of common equity and a  convertible note 
initially   shares were issued 
the note  which was issued to one of the company s directors  converted into  shares of common stock upon shareholder approval at the december annual meeting 
during  the company issued  shares of common stock as a result of exercises of stock options and warrants 
the company received approximately  in cash proceeds as a result of these transactions 
other matters the company continues to be optimistic about its future prospects and growth potential 
however  the recent rapid growth of the business has created a near term need for certain machinery  equipment and working capital in order to enhance capacity and build product to meet demand 
the recent positive financial results during have enhanced the company s ability to acquire additional financing 
the company continually explores various sources of capital  including utilizing its unleveraged assets as collateral for additional borrowing capacity  issuing new or refinancing existing debt  and raising equity through private or public offerings 
although it is evaluating these alternatives  the company believes it has the ability over the next months to finance its operations primarily through internally generated funds  or through the use of additional financing that currently is available to the company 
as described in part i  item  legal proceedings  the company is involved in certain environmental matters with respect to its facility in newark  new york 
although the company has reserved for expenses related to this potential exposure  there can be no assurance that such reserve will be the maximum amount 
the ultimate resolution of this matter may have a significant adverse impact on the results of operations in the period in which it is resolved 
the company typically offers warranties against any defects due to product malfunction or workmanship for a period up to one year from the date of purchase 
the company also offers a year warranty on its volt batteries that are used in ionization type smoke detector applications 
the company provides for a reserve for this potential warranty expense  which is based on an analysis of historical warranty issues 
there is no assurance that future warranty claims will be consistent with past history  and in the event the company s experiences a significant increase in warranty claims  there is no assurance that the company s reserves are sufficient 
this could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements payments due by period contractual obligations more total less than than year years years years debt obligations   capital lease obligations    operating lease obligations      purchase obligations   total      the company has no off balance sheet arrangements 
outlook looking ahead for the full calendar year of  the company is optimistic about its growth prospects and the status of manufacturing operations 
at this time  the company expects revenues to reach  in  more than a increase over the  in revenues reported for the company is projecting growth in all major product areas within its business volt  cylindrical and rechargeable 
the company expects continued growth in demand for its military batteries  particularly for the ba battery 
of the total revenues projected for  revenues of rechargeable battery products are expected to be in the range of at least  the company projects revenues of approximately  in the first quarter of  with continued growth expected into the second quarter due to current visibility of orders from the military 
the outlook for the second half of the year  at this time  is that the military demand may level off somewhat 
the results in each of the quarters can be subject to fluctuations as the timing of some customer orders is not often easily predictable 
in particular  volt revenues are dependent upon continued demand from the company s customers  some of which are dependent upon retail sell through 
similarly  revenues from sales of cylindrical products  primarily to military customers  are dependent upon a variety of factors  including the timing of the battery solicitation process within the military  the company s ability to successfully win contract awards  successful qualification of the company s products in the applicable military applications  the timing of shipments related to lot acceptance  and the timing of order releases against such contracts 
additionally  there is always a risk that congressional appropriations might vary from what is needed or expected 
some of these factors are outside of the company s direct control 
one of the company s key target markets continues to be the military market 
the us army cecom typically awards year contracts for its battery procurements  normally split between two suppliers 
the current battery procurement process of the us army cecom is referred to as next gen ii 
there are four phases to this overall solicitation 
phase i pertained to lithium sulfur dioxide batteries  which the company does not manufacture  and therefore  it did not participate in the bidding for this phase 
phases ii  iii  and iv pertain to the manufacture of lithium manganese dioxide batteries which match with the company s capabilities 
for phase ii  referred to as the small cylindrical phase  the company successfully bid  and  in may  was awarded the portion for this five year contract  amounting to up to million over the five year term 
for phase iii  referred to as the large cylindrical phase  the company had provided its bid proposal to the us army cecom in august and has since been awaiting notification of awards 
in march  the company was notified that it was not selected to participate in this phase  which would have amounted to up to approximately million over the five year time horizon of the contract 
while the company is disappointed in this outcome  this result does not alter the company s current financial outlook  as this contract had not been incorporated in the guidance that has previously been provided by the company 
phase iv of the next gen ii solicitation is referred to as the rectangular phase 
the formal solicitation for this phase was issued in january and was split into two pieces  one of which includes the ba battery that the company is already manufacturing under exigent  or non bid  contracts 
the other piece consists of the ba battery  for which the solicitation will result in a small business set aside contract 
bids are due to be submitted for these products in mid march the company cannot predict when final awards will be made or what the final outcome may be 
the total amount for this phase of next gen ii is expected to be in the range of up to approximately million over five years 
in the meantime  the company plans to continue to fulfill its current obligations related to exigent contracts  and to pursue other such contracts as the opportunity arises 
the company s current guidance incorporates ongoing ba contracts 
over the next three to five years  with anticipated growth in various target markets  such as military  medical  automotive telematics  and search and rescue  the company has targeted an annual growth rate in revenues of  heading toward  while the company s revenues are expected to be comprised of approximately from military sales in  this percentage is expected to decline over time as the company generates sales from customers in commercial markets 
the company has a fairly substantial fixed cost infrastructure to support its overall operations 
as sales continue to grow  manufacturing efficiencies are realized  and operating expenses r d and sg a are closely controlled  the company believes it can generate favorable returns to scale in the range of  and possibly as high as  on incremental revenues  depending on product mix 
conversely  decreasing volumes will likely result in the opposite effect 
gross margins in are expected to be in the range of 
within the next couple of years  the company believes that its gross margins can reach a range of as operating efficiencies improve and the mix of products with higher margins increases 
it has set a target of gross margins for the longer term  ie within the next five years 
r d costs in are expected to be at comparable levels as the company plans to continue its recent successful efforts related to new cylindrical battery development for applications that initially have a military focus  but often have sizeable commercial applications as well 
in addition  it is committing funds for the development of various thin cell and rechargeable products 
while the r d expense line is expected to remain relatively stable  the company also enhances these efforts with technology contracts  the revenues and related costs for which are reported as a part of the technology contracts segment 
while the company continues to monitor its operating costs very tightly  it expects that sg a costs will increase modestly over as it invests in additional sales and marketing efforts  and general administrative costs rise to support the growth of the business 
overall  the company expects that total operating expenses r d and sg a will amount to approximately of total revenues during  compared with in within the next couple of years  the company believes that its operating expenses will be in the range of of revenues  and it has set a target to reach of revenues in the longer term 
as gross margins improve and as the company continues to control its operating expenses  operating income is expected to amount to approximately  in within the next couple of years  operating income as a percentage of revenues  is projected to be in the range of  with a longer term target of  resulting from higher gross margins and lower operating expenses as a percentage of sales 
at december   the company had approximately  in net operating loss nol carryforwards available to offset current and future taxable income 
the company determined there was not sufficient positive evidence in accordance with fas to record a deferred tax asset at december  the company will continue to assess the appropriateness based upon profitability of recording a deferred tax asset for and beyond 
in addition  in early  the company determined that a change in ownership  as defined under internal revenue code section  had occurred during fourth quarter of  resulting in an annual limitation on the utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards 
the company is unable to accurately quantify the amount of such limitation at this time 
this limitation did not have an impact on income taxes determined for  but could result in a higher than anticipated current tax expense for and beyond  than if the company had experienced no change 
during  the company projects that it will spend approximately  to  on capital expenditures for machinery and equipment 
nearly one half of these expenditures are expected to be for projects that enhance manufacturing productivity  with relatively quick returns 
the remainder of these expenditures will be used to alleviate bottlenecks and increase capacity  as well as for tooling of new products 
in june  the company s credit facility with its primary lending bank is scheduled to expire 
the company is currently seeking and reviewing proposals from various lending institutions that would provide it with greater borrowing capacity  increased flexibility and lower borrowing costs 
the company plans to refinance this debt  or extend its current credit flexibility  before its current arrangement expires 
in general  the company continually explores its financing alternatives  including utilizing its unleveraged assets as collateral for additional borrowing capacity  refinancing current debt or issuing new debt  leasing assets  and raising equity through private or public offerings 
during  the company successfully managed its growth through the issuance of a  convertible note and proceeds from the exercise of stock options  as well as the use of its revolving credit facility 
in addition  in october  the company was successful in raising  through a private placement of  shares of common stock  where the net proceeds of  were provided to ultralife taiwan  inc in the form of a note receivable  convertible into shares of uti common stock subject to certain criteria 
although the company is confident that it will be successful in continuing to arrange adequate financing to support its growth  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to do so 
therefore  this could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial position and results of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein 
the estimates that require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments are described below 
revenue recognition battery sales revenues from the sale of batteries are recognized when products are shipped 
a provision is made at that time for warranty costs expected to be incurred 
customers do not have a general right of return on products shipped 
technology contracts the company recognizes revenue using the proportional effort method based on the relationship of costs incurred to date to the total estimated cost to complete the contract 
elements of cost include direct material  labor and overhead 
if a loss on a contract is estimated  the full amount of the loss is recognized immediately 
the company allocates costs to all technology contracts based upon actual costs incurred including an allocation of certain research and development costs incurred 
under certain research and development arrangements with the us government  the company may be required to transfer technology developed to the us government 
the company has accounted for the contracts in accordance with sfas no 
 research and development arrangements 
the company  where appropriate  has recognized a liability for amounts that may be repaid to third parties  or for revenue deferred until expenditures have been incurred 
in may  the company adopted the provisions of eitf revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
this issue provides guidance on how to determine when an arrangement that involves multiple revenue generating activities or deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes  and if this division is required  how the arrangement consideration should be allocated among the separate units of accounting 
adoption of this issue had no significant impact on the company s revenue recognition policy or results of operations 
in december  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
revenue recognition in financial statements 
the bulletin s primary purpose was to rescind accounting guidance contained in sab related to multiple element revenue arrangements  superceded as a result of the issuance of eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
this should not be considered a change in accounting principle 
the issuance did not have a material impact on the company 
warranties the company maintains provisions related to normal warranty claims by customers 
the company evaluates these reserves monthly based on actual experience with warranty claims to date 
impairment of long lived assets the company regularly assesses all of its long lived assets for impairment when events or circumstances indicate their carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
this is accomplished by comparing the expected undiscounted future cash flows of the assets with the respective carrying amount as of the date of assessment 
should aggregate future cash flows be less than the carrying value  a write down would be required  measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the asset 
fair value is estimated either through independent valuation or as the present value of expected discounted future cash flows 
if the expected undiscounted future cash flows exceed the respective carrying amount as of the date of assessment  no impairment is recognized 
environmental issues environmental expenditures that relate to current operations are expensed or capitalized  as appropriate  in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop  environmental remediation liabilities 
remediation costs that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations are accrued when it is probable that these costs will be incurred and can be reasonably estimated 
investments in affiliates the company reviews the appropriateness of the carrying value of its investments in affiliates 
typically  investments in which the company holds a greater than interest are recorded by the company on a consolidated basis of accounting  investments in which the company hold between and are accounted for using the equity method of accounting  and investments in which the company holds less than a interest are recorded using the cost method 
stock based compensation the company applies accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations which require compensation costs to be recognized based on the difference  if any  between the quoted market price of the stock on the grant date and the exercise price 
the company has adopted the disclosure only provision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
as all options granted to employees under such plans had an exercise price at least equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant  and given the fixed nature of the equity instruments  no stock based employee compensation cost is reflected in net income 
income tax liabilities the company applies sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  in accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that may be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
recent accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued interpretation no

risk factors dependence on continued demand for the company s existing products a substantial portion of the company s business depends on the continued demand for products using our batteries sold by original equipment manufacturers oem 
therefore  the company s success depends significantly upon the success of those oems products in the marketplace 
we are subject to many risks beyond our control that influence the success or failure of a particular product manufactured by an oem  including o competition faced by the oem in its particular industry  o market acceptance of the oem s product  o the engineering  sales  marketing and management capabilities of the oem  o technical challenges unrelated to our technology or products faced by the oem in developing its products  and o the financial and other resources of the oem for instance  in the year ended december   of the company s revenues were comprised of sales of its volt batteries  and of this  approximately pertained to sales to smoke alarm oems in the us in the six month period ended december   of the company s revenues were comprised of sales of its volt batteries  and of this  approximately pertained to sales to smoke alarm oems in the us if the retail demand for long life smoke detectors decreases significantly  this could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
similarly  in the year ended december   of the company s revenues were comprised of sales of us cylindrical batteries  and of this  approximately pertained to sales made directly or indirectly to the us military 
in the six month period ended december   of the company s revenues were comprised of sales of us cylindrical batteries  and of this  approximately pertained to sales made directly or indirectly to the us military 
if the demand for cylindrical batteries from the us military were to decrease significantly  this could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
risks related to adjustment of certain government contracts the company has certain exigent  non bid contracts with the government which are subject to an audit and final price adjustment which could decrease margins compared with the original terms of the contracts 
as of december   the company had one unfulfilled contract pertaining to ba battery orders from the military that was subject to audit and final price adjustment 
these adjustments could have an effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
risks related to development of rechargeable battery business although the company is in production of certain rechargeable cells and batteries  it cannot assure that volume acceptance of its rechargeable products will occur due to the highly competitive nature of the business 
there are many new company and technology entrants into the marketplace  and the company must continually reassess the market segments in which its products can be successful and seek to engage customers in these segments that will adopt the company s products for use in their products 
in addition  these companies must be successful with their products in their markets for the company to gain increased business 
increased competition  failure to gain customer acceptance of products or failure of the company s customers in their markets could have a further adverse effect on the company s rechargeable battery business 
risks relating to growth and expansion continued rapid growth of the company s battery business could significantly strain management  operations and technical resources 
if the company is successful in obtaining rapid market growth of its batteries  the company will be required to deliver large volumes of quality products to customers on a timely basis at a reasonable cost to those customers 
for example  the large orders recently received from the us and us military for the company s cylindrical products are straining the current capacity capabilities of the company and require additional equipment and time to build a sufficient support infrastructure 
this demand also creates working capital issues for the company  as it needs increased liquidity to fund purchases of raw materials and supplies 
the company cannot assure  however  that business will rapidly grow or that its efforts to expand manufacturing and quality control activities will be successful or that the company will be able to satisfy commercial scale production requirements on a timely and cost effective basis 
the company will also be required to continue to improve its operations  management and financial systems and controls 
the failure to manage growth effectively could have an adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on us military procurement of batteries the company will continue to develop both primary and rechargeable battery products to meet the needs of the us military forces 
the company believes it has a high probability for success in solicitations for these batteries 
any delay of solicitations by  or future failure of  the us government to purchase batteries manufactured by the company could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
risks related to competition and technological obsolescence the company also competes with large and small manufacturers of alkaline  carbon zinc  seawater  high rate and primary batteries as well as other manufacturers of lithium batteries 
the company cannot assure that it will successfully compete with these manufacturers  many of which have substantially greater financial  technical  manufacturing  distribution  marketing  sales and other resources 
the market for the company s products is characterized by changing technology and evolving industry standards  often resulting in product obsolescence or short product lifecycles 
although the company believes that its batteries are comprised of state of the art technology  there can be no assurance that competitors will not develop technologies or products that would render the company s technology and products obsolete or less marketable 
primary batteries the primary non rechargeable battery industry is characterized by intense competition with a number of companies offering or seeking to develop products similar to the company s 
the company is subject to competition from manufacturers of primary batteries  such as carbon zinc  alkaline and lithium batteries in various configurations  including volt  aaa  aa  c  d  a and other cell sizes 
manufacturers of primary batteries include the gillette company duracell  energizer holdings  inc  rayovac corp  sanyo electric co 
ltd  sony corp  and matsushita electric industrial co  ltd 
panasonic 
manufacturers of specialty lithium batteries include saft and eagle picher industries 
many of these companies have substantially greater resources than the company  and some have the capacity and volume of business to be able to produce their products more efficiently than the company at the present time 
in addition  these companies are developing batteries using a variety of battery technologies and chemistries that are expected to compete with the company s technology 
if these companies successfully market their batteries before the introduction of the company s products  there could be a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
rechargeable batteries the rechargeable battery industry is also characterized by intense competition with a large number of companies offering or seeking to develop technology and products similar to the company s 
the company is subject to competition from manufacturers of traditional rechargeable batteries  such as nickel cadmium batteries  from manufacturers of rechargeable batteries of more recent technologies  such as nickel metal hydride  lithium ion and lithium polymer batteries  as well as from companies engaged in the development of batteries incorporating new technologies 
manufacturers of nickel cadmium and or nickel metal hydride batteries include sanyo electric co 
ltd  sony corp  toshiba corp  saft and matsushita electric industrial co  ltd 
panasonic  among others 
manufacturers of lithium ion liquid electrolyte batteries currently include saft  toshiba corp  matsushita electric industrial co  ltd  sanyo electric co 
ltd  sony corp  e one moli energy ltd  byd co 
ltd  samsung sdi co  ltd  shenzhen b k electronic co 
ltd  and ultralife taiwan  inc  among others 
manufacturers of lithium polymer batteries currently include valence technology  inc  sony corp  amperex technology ltd  danionics a s  finecell co 
ltd  lg chemical  ltd  skc  samsung sdi co  ltd  and kokam engineering co  ltd 
many companies with substantially greater resources are developing a variety of battery technologies  including lithium ion and lithium polymer batteries  which are expected to compete with the company s technology 
if these companies successfully market their batteries before the introduction of the company s products  there could be a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on key personnel because of the specialized  technical nature of the business  the company is highly dependent on certain members of management  marketing  engineering and technical staff 
the loss of these services or these members could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition to developing manufacturing capacity to produce high volumes of batteries  the company must attract  recruit and retain a sizeable workforce of technically competent employees 
the company s ability to pursue effectively its business strategy will depend upon  among other factors  the successful recruitment and retention of additional highly skilled and experienced managerial  marketing  engineering and technical personnel 
the company cannot assure that it will be able to retain or recruit this type of personnel 
safety risks  demands of environmental and other regulatory compliance due to the high energy density inherent in lithium batteries  the company s batteries can pose safety certain risks  including the risk of fire 
although the company incorporates safety procedures in research  development and manufacturing processes that are designed to minimize safety risks  the company cannot assure that accidents will not occur 
although the company currently carries insurance policies which cover loss of the plant and machinery  leasehold improvements  inventory and business interruption  any accident  whether at the manufacturing facilities or from the use of the products  may result in significant production delays or claims for damages resulting from injuries 
these types of losses could have a material adverse effect on the business  financial condition and results of operations 
national  state and local laws impose various environmental controls on the manufacture  storage  use and disposal of lithium batteries and or of certain chemicals used in the manufacture of lithium batteries 
although the company believes that its operations are in substantial compliance with current environmental regulations and that  except as noted below  there are no environmental conditions that will require material expenditures for clean up at the present or former facilities or at facilities to which it has sent waste for disposal  there can be no assurance that changes in such laws and regulations will not impose costly compliance requirements on the company or otherwise subject it to future liabilities 
moreover  state and local governments may enact additional restrictions relating to the disposal of lithium batteries used by customers that could have a material adverse effect on business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the us department of transportation and certain foreign regulatory agencies that consider lithium to be a hazardous material regulate the transportation of batteries that contain lithium metal 
the company currently ships lithium batteries in accordance with regulations established by the us department of transportation 
there can be no assurance that additional or modified regulations relating to the manufacture  transportation  storage  use and disposal of materials used to manufacture the company s batteries or restricting disposal of batteries will not be imposed or how these regulations will affect the company or its customers 
in connection with the company s purchase lease of its newark  new york facility in  the company entered into a payment in lieu of tax agreement which provides the company with real estate tax concessions upon meeting certain conditions 
in connection with this agreement  a consulting firm performed a phase i and ii environmental site assessment which revealed the existence of contaminated soil and ground water around one of the buildings 
the company retained an engineering firm which estimated that the cost of remediation should be in the range of  this cost  however  is merely an estimate and the cost may in fact be much higher 
in february  the company entered into an agreement with a third party which provides that the company and this third party will retain an environmental consulting firm to conduct a supplemental phase ii investigation to verify the existence of the contaminants and further delineate the nature of the environmental concern 
the third party agreed to reimburse the company for fifty percent of the cost of correcting the environmental concern on the newark property 
the company has fully reserved for its portion of the estimated liability 
test sampling was completed in the spring of  and the engineering report was submitted to the new york state department of environmental conservation nysdec for review 
nysdec reviewed the report and  in january  recommended additional testing 
the company responded by submitting a work plan to nysdec  which was approved in april the company sought proposals from engineering firms to complete the remedial work contained in the work plan 
a firm was selected to undertake the remediation and in december the remediation was completed 
nysdec oversaw the remedial work and requested additional sampling which was completed in december of  as well 
the test results have been forwarded to nysdec and the company is awaiting further comment 
it is unknown at this time whether the final cost to remediate will be in the range of the original estimate  given the passage of time 
because this is a voluntary remediation  there is no requirement for the company to complete the project within any specific time frame 
the ultimate resolution of this matter may have a significant adverse impact on the results of operations in the period in which it is resolved 
furthermore  the company may face claims resulting in substantial liability which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and the results of operations in the period in which such claims are resolved 
limited sources of supply certain materials used in products are available only from a single or a limited number of suppliers 
as such  some materials could become in short supply resulting in limited availability and or increased costs 
additionally  the company may elect to develop relationships with a single or limited number of suppliers for materials that are otherwise generally available 
due to the company s involvement with supplying military batteries to the government  the company could receive a government preference to continue to obtain critical supplies to meet military production needs 
however  if the government did not provide the company with a government preference in such circumstances  the difficulty in obtaining supplies could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial results 
although the company believes that alternative suppliers are available to supply materials that could replace materials currently used and that  if necessary  the company would be able to redesign its products to make use of such alternatives  any interruption in the supply from any supplier that serves as a sole source could delay product shipments and have a material adverse effect on the business  financial condition and results of operations 
although the company has experienced interruptions of product deliveries by sole source suppliers  these interruptions have not had a material adverse effect on the business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company cannot guarantee that it will not experience a material interruption of product deliveries from sole source suppliers 
dependence on proprietary technologies the company s success depends more on the knowledge  ability  experience and technological expertise of its employees than on the legal protection of patents and other proprietary rights 
the company claims proprietary rights in various unpatented technologies  know how  trade secrets and trademarks relating to products and manufacturing processes 
the company cannot guarantee the degree of protection these various claims may or will afford  or that competitors will not independently develop or patent technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to the company s technology 
the company protects its proprietary rights in its products and operations through contractual obligations  including nondisclosure agreements with certain employees  customers  consultants and strategic partners 
there can be no assurance as to the degree of protection these contractual measures may or will afford 
the company  however  has had patents issued and patent applications pending in the us and elsewhere 
the company cannot assure i that patents will be issued from any pending applications  or that the claims allowed under any patents will be sufficiently broad to protect its technology  ii that any patents issued to the company will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  or iii as to the degree or adequacy of protection any patents or patent applications may or will afford 
if the company is found to be infringing third party patents  there can be no assurance that it will be able to obtain licenses with respect to such patents on acceptable terms  if at all 
the failure to obtain necessary licenses could delay product shipment or the introduction of new products  and costly attempts to design around such patents could foreclose the development  manufacture or sale of products 
dependence on technology transfer agreements the company s research and development of advanced rechargeable battery technology and products utilizes internally developed technology  acquired technology and certain patents and related technology licensed by the company pursuant to non exclusive  technology transfer agreements 
there can be no assurance that competitors will not develop  independently or through the use of similar technology transfer agreements  rechargeable battery technology or products that are substantially equivalent or superior to the technologies and products currently under research and development 
risks related to china joint venture program in july  the company entered into several agreements related to the establishment of a manufacturing facility in changzhou  china  for the production and distribution in and from china of a lithium primary batteries 
changzhou ultra power battery co  ltd  a company organized in china china battery  purchased certain technology  equipment  training and consulting services relating to the design and operation of a lithium battery manufacturing plant 
china battery was required to pay approximately million to the company over the first two years of the agreement  of which approximately million has been paid 
the company attempted to collect the balance due under this contract 
however  china battery has indicated that it will not make these payments until certain contractual issues have been resolved 
due to china battery s questionable willingness to pay  the company wrote off in fiscal the entire balance owed as well as its investment aggregating  since china battery has not purchased technology  equipment  training or consulting services to produce batteries other than a lithium batteries  the company does not believe that china battery has the capacity to become a competitor 
the company does not anticipate that the manufacturing or marketing of a lithium batteries will be a substantial portion of its product line in the future 
however  in december  china battery sent a letter demanding reimbursement of an unspecified amount of losses they have incurred plus a refund for certain equipment that was sold to china battery 
the company has attempted to initiate negotiations to resolve the dispute 
however  an agreement has not yet been reached 
although china battery has not taken any additional steps  there can be no assurance that china battery will not further pursue such a claim which  if successful  could have a material adverse effect on the business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company believes that such a claim is without merit 
ability to insure against losses because certain of the company s primary batteries are used in a variety of security and safety products and medical devices  it may be exposed to liability claims if such a battery fails to function properly 
the company maintains what it believes to be sufficient liability insurance coverage to protect against potential claims  however  there can be no assurance that the liability insurance will continue to be available  or that any such liability insurance would be sufficient to cover any claim or claims 
quarterly fluctuations in operating results and possible volatility of stock price the company s future operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter depending on factors such as the timing and shipment of significant orders  new product introductions  delays in customer releases of purchase orders  the mix of distribution channels through which the company sells its products and general economic conditions 
frequently  a substantial portion of the company s revenues in each quarter is generated from orders booked and shipped during that quarter 
as a result  revenue levels are difficult to predict for each quarter 
if revenue results are below expectations  operating results will be adversely affected as the company has a sizeable base of fixed overhead costs that do not vary much with the changes in revenue 
in addition to the uncertainties of quarterly operating results  future announcements concerning the company or its competitors  including technological innovations or commercial products  litigation or public concerns as to the safety or commercial value of one or more of its products  may cause the market price of its common stock to fluctuate substantially for reasons which may be unrelated to operating results 
these fluctuations  as well as general economic  political and market conditions  may have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
risks related to product warranty claims the company typically offers warranties against any defects due to product malfunction or workmanship for a period up to one year from the date of purchase 
the company also offers a year warranty on its volt batteries that are used in ionization type smoke detector applications 
the company provides for a reserve for this potential warranty expense  which is based on an analysis of historical warranty issues 
there is no assurance that future warranty claims will be consistent with past history  and in the event the company experiences a significant increase in warranty claims  there is no assurance that the company s reserves are sufficient 
this could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
risks related to company s ability to finance ongoing operations and projected growth while the company believes that its revenue growth projections and its ongoing cost controls will allow it to generate cash and achieve profitability in the foreseeable future  there is no assurance as to when or if the company will be able to achieve its projections 
the company s future cash flows from operations  combined with its accessibility to cash and credit  may not be sufficient to allow the company to finance ongoing operations or to make required investments for future growth 
the company may need to seek additional credit or access capital markets for additional funds 
there is no assurance that the company would be successful in this regard 
risks related to company s investment in ultralife taiwan  inc the company used the net proceeds of  that it received from the recent private placement sale of its common stock to fund a short term loan and ultimate planned purchase of securities issued by ultralife taiwan  inc the company currently owns approximately of ultralife taiwan 
the transaction has been recorded as a short term note receivable maturing on march   with interest accruing at per annum 
at march   the note remains unpaid and the company is negotiating the possible extension of the maturity date of this note receivable while uti continues its efforts to raise additional equity capital 
if uti is successful in raising additional funds  the company currently expects to convert this note receivable into shares of uti common stock 
depending on the price at which ultralife taiwan completes its anticipated capital raise  the company s ownership interest in ultralife taiwan could increase to approximately 
because of the current uncertain financial condition of ultralife taiwan  they may not be able to raise the necessary additional funds from other investors and the company may not be able to recover or realize any gain on our investment 
such an occurrence could adversely affect the financial condition and the market value of the company s common stock 
risks related to maintaining debt obligations the company has certain debt covenants that must be maintained  most notably a requirement with its primary lending institution to meet certain levels of net worth 
there is no assurance that the company will be able to continue to meet these debt covenants in the future 
if the company defaults on any of its debt covenants and it is unable to renegotiate credit terms in order to comply with such covenants  this could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
risks related to limiting the use of net operating loss carryforwards at december   the company had approximately  of net operating loss carryforwards available to offset current and future taxable income 
due to cumulative losses reported for prior years and uncertainty as to the utilization of these tax attributes in future periods  the company has not recorded a deferred tax asset on its consolidated balance sheet 
the company will reevaluate the appropriateness of recording a deferred tax asset during in early  the company determined that a change in ownership  as defined by internal revenue code  had occurred during the fourth quarter of  resulting in an annual limitation on the utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards 
this limitation did not have an impact on income taxes determined for  but could result in a higher than anticipated current tax expense for and beyond than if the company had experienced no change 
risks related to arthur andersen llp being the company s past auditors there may be no effective remedy against arthur andersen llp in connection with a material misstatement or omission in the financial statements audited by them  due to the fact that arthur andersen llp was convicted on june  of federal obstruction of justice arising from the government s investigation of enron corp 
arthur andersen llp consented to the inclusion of their report in the annual reports and registration statements the company filed prior to june  the company s inability to include in future registration statements or reports financial statements for one or more years audited by arthur andersen llp or to obtain arthur andersen llp s consent to the inclusion of their report on the company s and financial statements may impede the company s access to the capital markets 
should the company seek to access the public capital markets  securities and exchange commission sec rules will require the company to include or incorporate by reference in any prospectus three years of audited financial statements 
until the company s audited financial statements for the fiscal year ending december  become available  the sec s current rules would require the company to present audited financial statements for one or more fiscal years audited by arthur andersen llp
