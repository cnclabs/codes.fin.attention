item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview vse organization the term vse or company refers to vse and its subsidiaries and divisions unless the context indicates operations of the parent company only 
vse s business operations consist primarily of services performed by the company s wholly owned subsidiaries and unincorporated divisions 
active subsidiaries in include energetics incorporated energetics and human resource systems  inc hrsi 
active divisions include bav division bav  coast guard division vcg beginning in february  communications and engineering division ced beginning in february  fleet maintenance division fmd  management sciences division msd  systems engineering division sed  formerly land systems division  telecommunications technologies division ttd  and value systems services division vss 
in february  vse began phasing out the operations of ttd and expects all ttd contractual obligations will be satisfied and operations will cease in some of ttd s technical capabilities have been transferred to other vse divisions 
the sole hrsi contract expired on may   and this work was continued on a new contract in another vse division 
vse also has several other subsidiaries and divisions that were inactive in  but had contract activity in years prior to the company uses multiple operating divisions to bid on and perform contract work 
the use of these divisions enables the company to use an operating structure that is flexible and well suited to perform certain types of contract work 
the company anticipates that it will continue using its operating divisions to bid and perform new contract work to serve the needs of customers 
management believes that this strategy best positions the consolidated entity for future revenue growth 
vse services the company is engaged principally in providing engineering  design  logistics  management and technical services to the us government the government  other government prime contractors  and commercial entities 
the largest customer for the services rendered by the company is the us department of defense defense  including agencies of the us army  navy  and air force 
bav is a major provider of logistics  training  and technical assistance in support of the navy s ship transfer program 
vcg provides similar services to the us coast guard 
fmd supports the navy by providing a variety of services including ship installation efforts  combat systems inspections  ship repair and overhaul availability planning  harpoon weapons management  ordnance alteration  and air combat logistics 
vss provides the navy with outsourcing decision assistance 
sed provides the army with engineering and technical support for ground weapons  logistics and training services  material procurement support  and prototype development support for combat vehicles 
msd provides the army  other government agencies  and commercial organizations with quality training services for product  process  and management optimization 
ced provides management oversight and coordinates support efforts for a variety of department of defense agency work orders 
the company has also provided support services to the us postal service for over twenty years and is continuing to support this customer through its vss division 
energetics is focused on providing the department of energy and other government and industry customers with expert consulting services in environmental management and energy supply  resource management  and conservation 
ttd has offered products  services  and support in network  multimedia  and audio visual technology 
this includes design  installation  management and support for voice  data  multimedia and related projects 
vse has transferred some of the technical capabilities of ttd to sed and other divisions 
management outlook vse believes that its short term future outlook  based on expected revenue growth under existing contracts  is more positive than in recent years 
the taiwan ship transfer work on the bav contract see bav contract below will contribute significantly to near term revenue growth 
vse s company wide funded backlog at december   was approximately million  the highest amount since revenues are also growing in several of vse s other divisions 
profit margins in most of vse s divisions were up in and can be expected to show further improvement as the company s revenue base grows 
the company has a positive cash flow and cash of approximately million as of december  this positive short term trend is tempered by two areas of concern to management 
ced incurred pretax losses of approximately thousand in  its first year of operation 
while management has addressed this issue by adopting a less aggressive pricing strategy  ced may continue to incur losses in vse has accrued liabilities of approximately thousand against any future losses associated with ced operations as of december  the second concern involves the utilization of the company s primary office facility 
vse does not always occupy all of the space in its primary leased office facility and has from time to time subleased parts of this facility to other tenants 
during  some of the larger tenants did not renew their subleases with vse  leaving the facility underutilized as of december  the company is attempting to find new tenants to sub lease space  but the potential exists for continued underutilization of the facility that could negatively impact earnings in we believe that we will be able to sublease the majority of the available space by the end of the longer term future outlook for vse centers on the uncertainty associated with the renewal of the bav contract 
bav expects the us navy to solicit bids for a new contract and intends to aggressively pursue the award of the new contract 
bav is confident in its ability to capture this award and continue work on the ship transfer program  however  the size of this effort will entice other companies to offer strong competition 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that bav will win the new contract 
if bav fails to win the new contract  vse will suffer a significant loss of future revenue and profits 
to mitigate this risk  vse has been exploring potential acquisition opportunities 
the company intends to continue these efforts in revenue recognition substantially all of the company s services are performed for its customers on a contract basis 
the three primary types of contracts used are cost type contracts  time and materials contracts  and fixed price contracts 
revenues result from work performed on these contracts by the company s employees and from pass through of costs for material and work performed by subcontractors 
revenues on cost type contracts are recorded as contract allowable costs are incurred and fees earned 
profits on cost type contracts are equal to the fees that are earned 
the bav contract terms specify award fee payments that are determined by performance and level of contract activity 
award fees are made three times during the year and a contract modification authorizing the award fee payment is issued subsequent to the period in which the work is performed 
the company does not recognize award fee income until the contract modification authorizing the award fee is certain 
due to such timing  and to fluctuations in the level of revenues  profits as a percentage of revenues on this contract will fluctuate from period to period 
revenues for time and materials contracts are recorded on the basis of contract allowable labor hours worked times the contract defined billing rates  plus the cost of materials used in performance on the contract 
profits on time and material contracts result from the difference between the cost of services performed and the contract defined billing rates for these services 
revenues on fixed price service contracts are recorded as services are provided 
revenues on other fixed price contracts are recorded as costs are incurred  using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
profits on fixed price contracts result from the difference between the incurred costs and the revenue earned 
the company will occasionally perform work at risk  which is work that is performed prior to the government formalizing funding for such work 
revenue related to work performed at risk is not recognized until it can be reliably estimated and its realization is probable 
vse recognizes this risk funding as revenue when the associated costs are incurred or the work is performed 
as of december   vse has recognized approximately thousand in risk funding 
vse believes that it will receive funding for all of this risk funding revenue 
vse is at risk of loss for any risk funding not received 
the company provides for anticipated losses on contracts by a charge to income during the period in which losses are first identified 
revenues by contract type for the three years ended december  were as follows in thousands contract type revenues revenues revenues cost type    time and materials    fixed price    government procurement policies and practices vse s business is subject to the risks arising from economic conditions and political factors that may impact the budgets and program funding of customers served through vse s contracts 
vse s revenues have historically been subject to annual fluctuations resulting from changes in the level of defense spending 
future budgetary and funding decisions by government lawmakers or defense restructuring efforts could affect the types and level of services provided by vse to its government customers and could potentially have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
the company s revenues depend on the ability of the company to win new contracts and on the amount of work ordered by the government under the company s existing contracts 
the company s ability to win new contracts is affected by government acquisition policies and procedures  including government procurement practices that in some years have tended toward bundling work efforts under large comprehensive omnibus management contracts 
this emphasis on large contracts presents challenges to winning new contract work  including making it more difficult for the company to qualify as a bidder  increases in the level of competition due to the award of fewer contracts  and forcing the company into competition with larger organizations that have greater financial resources and larger technical staffs 
competing for these contracts requires the company to use teams of subcontractors to be able to offer the range of technical competencies needed to do the work 
while the use of subcontractors on a large scale basis allows the company to compete for this work  profit margins on subcontract work are lower than on work performed by company personnel  thereby reducing the company s overall profit margins 
the use of subcontractors on government contracts also raises certain performance and financial risks to vse in that government prime contractors are usually obligated to ensure compliance with us government regulations relative to the performance by subcontractors 
other government procurement practices that can affect the company s revenues are the use of past performance criteria that may preclude entrance into new government markets and government social programs that limit contract work to small  woman  or minority owned businesses 
additional risk factors that could potentially affect the company s results of operations are the government s right to terminate contracts for convenience  the government s right to not exercise all of the option periods on a contract  and funding delays caused by government political or administrative actions 
bav contract vse s bav division has a contract with the us navy to provide engineering  technical and logistical support services associated with the sale  lease  or transfer of navy ships to foreign governments 
this cost plus contract is a ten year contract awarded in and has a total ceiling value of over one billion dollars over the life of the contract 
as of december   bav has recognized cumulative revenues on this contract of approximately million and funded backlog was approximately million 
revenues generated by this contract have typically accounted for approximately to of consolidated vse revenues  and during and the contract accounted for approximately and of consolidated revenues  respectively 
contract terms specify award fee payments to bav that are determined by performance and level of contract activity 
award fees are made three times during the year and a contract modification authorizing the award fee payment is issued subsequent to the period in which the work is performed 
the company does not recognize award fee income until the contract modification authorizing the award fee is certain 
due to such timing  and to fluctuations in the level of revenues  profits as a percentage of revenues will fluctuate from period to period 
as of december   award fee has been recognized for work performed through the award fee period ended august  the level of revenues and associated profits resulting from fee income generated by this contract varies depending on a number of factors  including the timing of ship transfers and associated support services ordered by foreign governments and economic conditions of potential customers worldwide 
the company has experienced significant quarterly and annual revenue fluctuations and anticipates that future quarterly and annual revenues will be subject to significant variations primarily due to changes in the level of activity on this contract 
the us navy has approved the transfer of four us navy ships to taiwan  with work related to this transfer to be performed under the bav contract 
this transfer is expected to result in a significant increase in the revenues of bav during the time this work is performed beginning in bav has received a contract delivery order related to this work in early of approximately million 
the original bav contract ending date was in the us navy recently modified the contract for the purpose of ensuring continuity of work with respect to the transfer of ships to taiwan 
the modification provided contractual coverage for this work effort into indications are that the us navy intends to issue a new contract for the overall ship transfer program through a competitive bidding process 
there can be no assurance that bav will win the award for this new contract 
if bav fails to win this new contract award  it could have a material adverse impact on the company s future results of operation and financial condition 
global economic conditions and political factors vse s business is subject to the risks arising from global economic conditions and political factors associated with current and potential customers served through vse s contracts with the us government 
an economic slowdown in countries served under the bav contract could potentially affect sales 
the current international situation posed by potential terrorist activity and the continuing conflict in the middle east could potentially increase the political risks associated with bav contract revenues 
failure by the government of a potential foreign customer to approve and fund acquisition of us navy ships serviced under the bav contract could affect sales 
in any one year  a significant amount of the company s revenues may result from sales on the bav contract to a single foreign government 
during and  revenues associated with bav contract sales to egypt accounted for approximately and of the company s revenues  respectively 
future years revenues are expected to include large amounts of bav contract sales to both egypt and taiwan 
in addition to the effect on bav contract work  international tensions can also affect work by fmd on us navy ships when they are deployed outside of us navy facilities and are unavailable for maintenance work during this time period 
adverse results arising from these global economic and political risks could potentially have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations 
concentration of revenues source of revenue revenues revenues revenues bav egypt    bav other    total bav    vse other    total revenues    critical accounting policies vse s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require vse to make estimates and assumptions 
in addition to the vse revenue recognition policy  discussed under executive overview above  the company believes the following critical accounting polices affect our more significant judgments  estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
long lived assets in assessing the recoverability of long lived assets  including goodwill and other intangibles  vse must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  vse may be required to record impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded 
contingencies from time to time vse is subject to proceedings  lawsuits and other claims related to environmental  labor and other matters 
vse is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these contingencies as well as potential ranges of probable losses and establish reserves accordingly 
the amount of reserves required may change in future periods due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach to a matter such as a change in settlement strategy 
income taxes the carrying value of vse net deferred tax assets is based on assumptions regarding vse s ability to generate sufficient future taxable income to utilize these deferred tax assets 
if the estimates and related assumptions regarding vse s future taxable income change in the future  vse may be required to record valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets  resulting in additional income tax expense

revenues were substantially the same for the year ended december   and increased by approximately for the year ended december   as compared to each of the respective prior years 
during  the company had decreased revenues in some of its divisions and subsidiaries which were offset by increases in the revenues of others 
the most notable areas of declines in revenue were in bav  which was due to work ordered by certain client countries in that was not repeated in  and ttd due to the decision to phase out operations 
revenues also declined for hrsi and vss 
the declines in revenues of these divisions were offset by the revenues generated by the start up of ced and an increase in the revenues of the company s other active divisions compared to the prior year 
while the increased revenues in sed  msd  and vcg were not significant in proportion to total company revenues  the increases were significant in proportion to the prior years revenues of each of these divisions 
the increase in revenues during was primarily due to an increase in the level of services ordered under the bav contract  and the start up of new businesses see business termination and new business start up below 
these increases were partially offset by decreased revenues associated with closing srr see business termination and new business start up below and the expiration of the ordnance contract see contract expirations below 
during the period from to  a significant amount of contract work previously performed by vse parent company was transitioned to the fmd and sed divisions 
certain program efforts supporting the us navy have been transferred from ordnance into vss in and then into fmd in contract expirations 
vse s ordnance division had a contract with the us navy to provide program management and logistics services that expired in december vse re bid and was awarded the successor contract in its fleet maintenance division 
this contract is a five year contract awarded in october  and it has the potential to generate total revenues of approximately million from through one program performed by sed under the predecessor contract was not renewed under the new contract  and this work was not performed by the company during the first three months of the lapse in contract coverage for this program resulted in a loss of revenue and profit associated with the program for the company during this period 
a subsequent contract was obtained in april of and work on the program resumed 
business terminations and new business start ups 
in february  vse decided to terminate operations of ttd due to declining revenues and to significant losses sustained by this division 
in  ttd experienced a revenue decline of approximately and a pretax loss of approximately million  including a loss associated with the impairment of intangible assets of thousand 
ttd continued work on uncompleted contracts during to satisfy its contractual obligations and will finish work in before ceasing operations 
revenues from ttd represented approximately of total company revenues and the pretax loss on ttd operations was reduced to approximately thousand in vse believes that its current reserves are adequate to cover any potential losses from the closing of ttd operations 
some of ttd s technical capabilities were transferred to other vse divisions 
the loss of future revenue associated with the termination of ttd operations is not expected to be significant compared to total future vse revenue  while the elimination of ttd losses is expected to improve future vse profits 
in january  vse formed its communications and engineering division ced upon the award of a multi year rapid response support contract by the us army communications electronics command cecom 
if all options are exercised  this contract has a potential total ceiling of billion over an eight year period 
the contract is a multiple award  indefinite delivery  indefinite quantity contract  and vse revenues from it are expected to be considerably less than the contract ceiling amount 
while actual revenue estimates for the contract cannot be predicted  it is expected that this contract will contribute to future vse revenue growth 
in  vse decided to discontinue srr s ship remediation and recycling efforts at the hunters point shipyard in san francisco  california  due to the limited business opportunities associated with ship dismantlement work  due in part to an absence of any significant amount of government funding for these efforts 
profitability from the srr work was marginal for vse relative to the risk 
also in  vse formed msd to offer government and commercial organizations quality training and product  process  and management optimization services 
in february  vcg began work for the us coast guard under a contract that has potential to generate total revenues of approximately million over five years 
vse expects revenues from msd and vcg to more than offset the loss of revenues formerly generated by srr  with profit margins higher than that provided by srr 
during  revenues from msd and vcg were approximately equal to the revenues generated by srr in the combined revenues of msd and vcg doubled in and are expected to continue to grow in income from operations before income taxes the following table shows consolidated revenues and income from operations before income taxes  other items of income and expense  and such amounts as a percent of revenues

income from operations before income taxes 

   vse s gross profit margins improved in as compared to prior years 
this improvement is primarily due to the phase out of ttd and the reduction of losses associated with this division 
the company s gross profit margins also improved due to increases in the gross profit margins of most of its operating divisions and also due to the increased revenues in higher margin divisions  including msd  sed  and vcg 
the company wide gross margin increases were partially offset by operational losses associated with ced  and to a lesser extent by start up costs associated with ced 
during  ttd experienced significant losses as revenues for this division decreased approximately 
costs and expenses of operating ttd did not decrease in proportion to the revenue decline  which resulted in losses 
gross profit margins on revenues in other vse divisions and subsidiaries  in the aggregate  increased during this period due to the increase in total vse revenues while a portion of the costs and expenses of operating the company remained fixed 
the combination of these two factors resulted in vse gross profit margins remaining substantially unchanged in as compared to other factors that affect the percentage of costs and expenses to revenues include the amount of work performed on the bav contract as a percentage of total revenues  the timing of contract award fees  effective project and cost management  and competitive factors 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of costs and expenses that are not chargeable or reimbursable on the company s operating unit contracts 
as a percentage of revenues  these expenses remained substantially unchanged in and as compared to the respective prior years 
vse has not had significant borrowing requirements or interest expense in   and the company had interest income in as compared to interest expense in  and interest expense declined in as compared to  as profits from operations were used to pay down borrowings and cash surpluses were invested 
in  the company took a loss associated with the impairment of intangible assets of thousand held by ttd 
these assets consisted of acquired contracts  proposals  and opportunities  files and documentation  rights to hire certain individuals  customer lists  trademarks  and  website rights 
the purpose of these acquired assets was to assist in the business development efforts of ttd 
the decision by vse to terminate the operations of ttd rendered these business development assets worthless 
financial condition vse s financial condition did not change materially during the company s largest asset is its accounts receivable and its largest liabilities are its accounts payable and accrued expenses 
accounts receivable increased approximately million  and accounts payable and accrued expenses increased approximately million in as compared to due to a significant level of work in december  the timing of subcontractor activity  and the associated payments required to perform this work 
cash and cash equivalents increased approximately million in as a result of net income and the timing of subcontractor activity and associated payments 
the increase in total stockholder s investment in resulted primarily from earnings and dividend activity and from the exercise of stock options 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows the company s cash and cash equivalents increased by approximately million during approximately million in net cash was provided by operating activities  investing activities used approximately thousand  and financing activities used approximately thousand 
investing activities consisted of the purchase of property and equipment 
financing activities consisted of thousand used to pay dividends and thousand provided by the issuance of common stock associated with the exercise of stock options 
cash flows provided by operating activities increased in as compared to due primarily to increases in net income and accounts payable and accrued expenses  which was partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable 
the company s cash and cash equivalents increased by approximately million during approximately million in net cash was provided by operating activities  investing activities used approximately thousand  and financing activities used approximately thousand 
investing activities consisted of the purchase of property and equipment 
financing activities consisted of the repayment of thousand of bank loan borrowings  thousand used to pay dividends  and thousand provided by the issuance of common stock associated with the exercise of stock options 
cash flows provided by operating activities increased in as compared to due primarily to a decrease in accounts receivable  which was partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable 
cash and cash equivalents declined by thousand during as a result of approximately million used in investing activities  approximately million provided by operating activities  and approximately thousand provided by financing activities 
investing activities consisted of million used to purchase property and equipment  including investments in vse s information technology infrastructure and facilities improvements 
financing activities consisted of thousand provided by bank loan borrowing  thousand provided by the issuance of common stock associated with the exercise of stock options and thousand used to pay cash dividends 
cash dividends were declared at the rate of 
per share during  and pursuant to its bank loan agreement see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the payment of cash dividends by vse is subject to annual rate restrictions 
vse has paid cash dividends each year since liquidity the company s internal sources of liquidity result primarily from operating activities  specifically from changes in the level of revenues and associated accounts receivable and accounts payable from period to period  and from profitability 
an increase in net income contributed to an increase in internally generated cash flows during significant increases or decreases in revenue and accounts receivable and accounts payable can cause significant increases or decreases in internal liquidity 
accounts receivable arise primarily from billings made by the company to the government or other government prime contractors for services rendered and payments received on accounts receivable represent the principal source of cash for the company 
accounts receivable levels can be affected by contract retainages  differences between the provisional billing rates authorized by the government compared to the costs actually incurred by the company  government delays in processing administrative paperwork for contract funding  and the timing of large materials purchases and subcontractor efforts used in performance on company s contracts 
accounts payable arise primarily from purchases of subcontractor services and materials used by the company in the performance of its contract work 
payments made on accounts payable  along with payments made to satisfy employee payroll and payroll associated expenses  make up the principal cash requirements of the company 
accounts payable levels can be affected by changes in the level of contract work performed by the company and by the timing of large materials purchases and subcontractor efforts used in performance on the company s contracts 
other cash requirements include the acquisition of capital assets for office and computer support  facilities maintenance  and the payment of cash dividends 
the company plans additional spending of approximately thousand in for facilities improvements at two locations 
this cash requirement is for the expansion of its facility in ladysmith  virginia in support of the expected growth in its system engineering division and improvements at its primary office facility in alexandria  virginia 
vse s external sources of liquidity consist of a revolving bank loan agreement that provides loan financing based on the company s accounts receivable see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the bank financing complements the internal sources of liquidity by providing increasing levels of borrowing capacity as accounts receivable levels increase 
the bank loan agreement provided loan financing up to a maximum commitment of million as of december  the company has determined that the million commitment is adequate to cover current and future liquidity requirements 
the company did not borrow against this loan in performance of work under the bav contract has the potential to cause substantial requirements for working capital  however  management believes that current cash surpluses  cash flows from future operations  and the bank loan commitment are adequate to meet current operating cash requirements 
contractual obligations the following table shows the consolidated contractual obligations as of december  in thousands payments due by period less than after contractual obligations total year years years years operating leases  net of non cancelable sublease income     purchase obligations   total     purchase obligations includes two general categories of obligations 
the first category consists of obligations incurred in the normal course of business to satisfy performance requirements for vse customers 
such obligations include those arising from the acquisition of materials necessary to complete required tasks and the use of subcontractors to perform tasks for which the company may not have its own expertise 
subcontractor and material obligations accounted for approximately million of the total purchase obligations as of december  the second category of purchase obligations consists primarily of contractual commitments associated with construction  improvements or maintenance of vse facilities 
inflation and pricing most of the contracts performed by vse provide for estimates of future labor costs to be escalated for any option periods provided by the contracts  while the non labor costs included in such contracts are normally considered reimbursable at cost 
vse property and equipment consists principally of computer systems equipment and furniture and fixtures 
the overall impact of inflation on replacement costs of such property and equipment is expected to be insignificant 
forward looking disclosures goodwill in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

sfas no 
modifies the accounting rules governing goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives 
under sfas no 
 goodwill is no longer subject to amortization over its estimated useful life and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized over an arbitrary number of years 
goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are instead subject to a review for impairment at least annually 
the effective date for vse s implementation of sfas no 
was january  as of december   the company had approximately million of unamortized goodwill associated with its acquisition of energetics in the goodwill was being amortized prior to the adoption of sfas no 
in  the company stopped amortizing the goodwill 
as of december   the company has not recognized any reduction to the goodwill due to the impairment rules associated with sfas no 
if at some time in the future it is determined that impairment has occurred  such impairment could potentially have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
disclosures about market risk interest rates vse s bank loan financing provides available borrowing to the company at variable interest rates 
the company has not borrowed significant amounts on the loan in recent years 
accordingly  the company does not believe that any movement in interest rates would have a material impact on future earnings or cash flows 
if vse were to significantly increase borrowings on the current loan arrangement  future interest rate changes could potentially have such a material impact 
foreign currency while a significant amount of the company s business results from the services provided by bav related to the transfer of ships to foreign governments  the bav contract payments are made by the us government in us dollars 
additionally  most funding requirements to support work performed or services purchased in foreign countries are made in us dollars  and the infrequent disbursements that are made in foreign currencies are reimbursable to bav in post conversion dollars 
foreign currency transactions of other vse divisions or subsidiaries are virtually non existent 
accordingly  the company does not believe that it is exposed to any material foreign currency risk
