accordingly  the consolidated statements of operations of the company have been prepared  and its and consolidated statement of operations have been restated  to report the results of discontinued operations of sim including those of spgi separately from the continuing operations of the company  and the following discussions reflect such restatement 
in october  the company dissolved its technology division that was established in march for the purpose of marketing its proprietary internet based computer software 
the operations of this subsidiary were not material 
critical accounting policy estimates the company s critical accounting policies  including the assumptions and judgments underlying them  are disclosed in the note to the financial statements 
these policies have been consistently applied in all material respects and address such matters as revenue recognition  depreciation methods  asset impairment recognition  business combination accounting  and discontinued business accounting 
while the estimates and judgments associated with the application of these policies may be affected by different assumptions or conditions  the company believes the estimates and judgments associated with the reported amounts are appropriate in the circumstances 
three critical accounting policies are revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts and sales allowance  and internal use software development costs revenue recognition the company s services are provided under contracts or agreements that consist primarily of service fees and per unit fee arrangements 
revenues under service fee arrangements are recognized when the service is performed 
the company s per unit contracts or agreements provide for fees to be earned based on the retail sales of client s products to consumers 
the company recognizes per unit fees in the period such amounts become determinable and are reported to the company 
allowance for doubtful accounts and sales allowance the company continually monitors the collectability of its accounts receivable based upon current customer credit information and other information available 
utilizing this information  the company has established an allowance for doubtful accounts of  and  at december  and  respectively 
the company also recorded a sales allowance of  to properly reflect potential customer credits as of december  internal use software development costs the company under the rules of sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use  capitalizes certain costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining internal use software

results of operations the following table sets forth selected financial data and such data as a percentage of net revenues for the periods indicated 
year ended year ended year ended december  december  december  dollars in millions dollars dollars dollars net revenues cost of revenues selling  general administrative expenses depreciation amortization other income expenses  net loss income from continuing operations before income tax provision income tax provision loss income from continuing operations discontinued operations loss from discontinued operations  net of tax benefits estimated loss on disposal of discontinued operations  net of tax benefits net loss income results from continuing operations for the twelve months ended december   compared to twelve months ended december  net revenues net revenues from operations for the twelve months ended december   were million  compared to million for the twelve months ended december   a decrease 
the decrease of in net revenues is primarily attributed to decreased business in mass merchandiser chains 
the decrease in net revenues was caused by decreased per unit fee revenue resulting from lower retail sales of customer products and the loss of a particular client  partially offset by increases in service fee revenue 
cost of revenues cost of revenues from operations consists of in store labor and field management wages  related benefits  travel and other direct labor related expenses

approximately and of the field services were purchased from the company s affiliate  sms  in and  respectively see item certain relationships and related transactions  below 
sms s increased share of field services resulted from its more favorable cost structure 
the increase in cost as a percentage of net revenues is primarily a result of a decrease in per unit fee revenues that do not have a proportionate decrease in cost 
as discussed above under critical accounting policies revenue recognition  the company s revenue consists of service fee revenue  which is earned when the merchandising services are performed and  therefore  has proportionate costs in the period the services are performed  and per unit fee revenue  which is earned when the client s product is sold to the consumer at retail  not when the services are performed and  therefore  does not have proportionate costs in the period the revenue is earned 
since the merchandising service and the related costs associated with per unit fee revenue are normally performed prior to the retail sale  and the retail sales of client products are influenced by numerous factors including consumer tastes and preferences  and not solely by the merchandising service performed  in any given period  the cost of per unit fee revenues may not be directly proportionate to the per unit fee revenue
