item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations reference is made throughout this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations to notes included in the consolidated financial statements  beginning on page f of this report 
overview industry background we operate in two segments the pulp and papermaking equipment and systems papermaking equipment segment and the composite and fiber based products segment 
through our papermaking equipment segment  we develop  manufacture  and market a range of equipment and products for the domestic and international papermaking and paper recycling industries 
we have a large  stable customer base that includes most of the world s major paper manufacturers 
as a result  we have one of the largest installed bases of equipment in the pulp and paper industry 
our installed base provides us with a spare parts and consumables business that yields higher margins than our capital equipment business  and which  we believe  is less susceptible to the cyclical trends in the paper industry 
through our composite and fiber based products segment  we develop  manufacture  and market composite products made from recycled fiber and plastic  primarily for the building industry  and manufacture and sell granules derived from pulp fiber for use as carriers for agricultural  home lawn and garden  and professional lawn  turf  and ornamental applications 
international sales during  approximately of our sales were to customers outside the united states  principally in europe and asia 
we generally seek to charge our customers in the same currency in which our operating costs are incurred 
however  our financial performance and competitive position can be affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations affecting the relationship between the us dollar and foreign currencies 
we seek to reduce our exposure to currency fluctuations through the use of forward currency exchange contracts 
we may enter into forward contracts to hedge certain firm purchase and sale commitments denominated in currencies other than our subsidiaries functional currencies 
these contracts hedge transactions principally denominated in us dollars 

table of contents kadant inc annual report application of critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that entail significant judgments and uncertainties  and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that our most critical accounting policies upon which our financial condition depends  and which involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments  are those described below 
for a discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
in november  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a final consensus on eitf no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
the provisions of eitf no 
were required to be adopted for revenue arrangements entered into by us in fiscal periods beginning after june  eitf no 
addresses arrangements with customers that have multiple deliverables  such as equipment and installation  and provides guidance as to when recognition of revenue for each deliverable is appropriate 
adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on our financial statements 
in addition  we recognize revenues and profits on certain long term contracts using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
percentage of completion 
revenues recorded under the percentage of completion method of accounting were million in  million in  and million in the percentage of completion is determined by comparing the actual costs incurred to date to an estimate of total costs to be incurred on each contract 
if a loss is indicated on any contract in process  a provision is made currently for the entire loss 
our contracts generally provide for billing of customers upon the attainment of certain milestones specified in each contract 
revenues earned on contracts in process in excess of billings are classified as unbilled contract costs and fees  and amounts billed in excess of revenues are classified as billings in excess of contract costs and fees 
the complexity of the estimation process under the percentage of completion method affects the amounts reported in our financial statements 
a number of internal and external factors affect our percentage of completion and cost of sales estimates  including labor rate and efficiency variances  estimates of warranty costs  estimated future material prices from vendors  and customer specification and testing requirement changes 
in addition  we are exposed to the risk  primarily relating to our orders in china  that a customer will not comply with the order s contractual obligations causing the customer to forfeit its deposit on the order 
the contractual obligations relating to the order may be difficult to enforce through a foreign country s legal system  which could result in a significant credit exposure in the period or periods that were to be affected by the breach of contract 
although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our estimates in the application of this accounting policy  if our business conditions were to be different  or if we used different assumptions  it is possible that materially different amounts could be reported as revenues in our financial statements 
sab no 
under staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  when the terms of sale include customer acceptance provisions  and compliance with those provisions cannot be demonstrated until customer acceptance  revenues are recognized upon such acceptance 
when a sale arrangement involves multiple elements eg  installation  the company considers the guidance in eitf revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
such transactions are evaluated to determine whether the deliverables in the arrangement represent separate units of accounting 
if equipment and installation do not meet the separation criteria under eitf  revenues for products 
table of contents kadant inc annual report sold that require installation  where the installation is essential to functionality or is not deemed inconsequential or perfunctory  are recognized upon completion of installation 
revenues for products sold where installation is not essential to functionality  and is deemed inconsequential or perfunctory  are recognized upon shipment with estimated installation costs accrued 
we provide a reserve for the estimated warranty and installation costs at the time revenue is recognized  as applicable 
to the extent that installation becomes a significant component of our business in the future  the judgment associated with the determination of revenue recognition will increase 
the complexity of all issues related to the assumptions  risks  and uncertainties inherent in the application of sab no 
affects the amounts reported as revenues in our financial statements 
under sab no 
 we may not be able to reliably predict future revenues and profitability due to the difficulty of estimating when installation will be performed or when we will meet the contractually agreed upon performance tests  which can delay or prohibit recognition of revenues 
the determination of when we install the equipment or fulfill the performance guarantees is largely dependent on the customers  their willingness to allow installation of the equipment or performance of the appropriate tests in a timely manner  and their cooperation in addressing possible problems that would impede achievement of the performance guarantee criteria 
unexpected changes in the timing related to the completion of installation or performance guarantees could cause our revenues and earnings to be significantly affected 
inventories 
we value our inventory at the lower of the actual cost on a first in  first out  or weighted average basis or market value and include materials  labor  and manufacturing overhead 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and compare these amounts to historical and forecasted usage of and demand for each particular product or product line 
we record a charge to cost of revenues for excess and obsolete inventory to reduce the carrying value of the inventories to net realizable value 
inventory writedowns have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established 
a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand  resulting in a charge for the writedown of that inventory in that period 
in addition  our estimates of future product usage or demand may prove to be inaccurate  resulting in an understated or overstated provision for excess and obsolete inventory 
therefore  although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product usage and demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
valuation of goodwill and intangible assets 
we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets annually in the fourth quarter  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances  such as a decline in sales  earnings  or cash flows  or material adverse changes in the business climate  indicate that the carrying value of an asset might be impaired 
we completed our annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of using estimates from our strategic plans and long range forecasts 
no adjustment was required to the carrying value of our goodwill or other intangible assets based on the analysis performed 
goodwill is considered to be impaired when the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value 
fair values are primarily established using a discounted cash flow methodology specifically  the income approach 
the determination of discounted cash flows is based on our strategic plans and long range forecasts 
the revenue growth rates included in the forecasts are our best estimates based on current and anticipated market conditions  and the profit margin assumptions are projected based on the current and anticipated cost structures 
our judgments and assumptions regarding the determination of the fair value of an intangible asset or goodwill associated with an acquired business could change as future events impact such fair values 
any future impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our long term assets and operating expenses in the period in which impairment is determined to exist 
accounts receivable 
judgments are used in determining our allowance for bad debts and are based on our historical collection experience  current trends  credit policies  specific customer collection issues  and accounts receivable aging categories 
in determining this allowance  we look at historical writeoffs of our receivables 
we 
table of contents kadant inc annual report also look at current trends in the credit quality of our customer base as well as changes in our credit policies 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and each customer s current creditworthiness 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers 
in addition  in some instances we utilize letters of credit as a way to mitigate credit exposure 
while actual bad debts have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same rate of bad debts that we have in the past  especially in light of business conditions in the paper industry 
a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any of our customers could result in the uncollectibility of the related accounts receivable and could adversely impact our operating cash flows in that period 
warranties 
in the papermaking equipment segment  we offer warranties of various durations to our customers depending upon the specific product and terms of the customer purchase agreement 
we typically negotiate terms regarding warranty coverage and length of warranty depending on the products and applications 
our standard mechanical warranties require us to repair or replace a defective product during the warranty period at no cost to the customer 
in the composite and fiber based products segment  we offer a standard limited warranty to the original owner of our decking and roofing products  limited to repair or replacement of the defective product or a refund of the original purchase price 
we record an estimate for warranty related costs at the time of sale based on our actual historical return rates and repair costs 
in our papermaking equipment segment  while our warranty costs have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same warranty return rates or repair costs that we have in the past 
in our composite and fiber based products segment  we experienced an increase in warranty claims in the second half of related to excessive contraction of our decking products 
although we increased the warranty provisions in the second half accordingly  we cannot guarantee that the reserves established will be sufficient if we incur warranty return rates higher than we anticipated 
in either segment  a significant increase in warranty return rates or costs to repair our products would lead to an increase in the warranty provision and could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the period or periods in which such returns or additional costs occur 
industry and business outlook our products are primarily sold to the pulp and paper industry 
the paper industry  especially in north america  has been in a prolonged downcycle  characterized by weak pulp and paper prices  decreased capital spending  and consolidation of paper companies within the industry 
as paper companies consolidate in response to market weakness  they frequently reduce capacity and postpone or even cancel capacity addition or expansion projects 
this tendency  along with paper companies actions to quickly reduce operating rates and restrict capital spending and maintenance programs  has adversely affected our business 
over the long term  as the markets recover  we expect that consolidation in the paper industry and improved capacity management will have a positive effect on paper companies financial performance and  in return  will be favorable to both paper companies and their suppliers  such as kadant 
there has been a significant amount of downtime in north america and europe which  coupled with weak economic conditions in the paper industry  has produced a difficult market environment resulting in deferrals of capital projects by paper companies and pricing pressure in some of our product lines 
to mitigate the effects of these difficult market conditions in north america and europe  we continue to concentrate our efforts on several initiatives intended to improve our operating results  including focusing on expanding our business in china  higher margin parts and consumables businesses across all our product lines  sourcing the manufacture of non proprietary components from third party suppliers  shifting more production to our lower cost manufacturing facilities  and lowering our manufacturing overhead costs throughout the business 
in addition  we continue to focus our efforts on managing our operating costs  capital expenditures  and working capital 
despite the challenging industry environment  we are pursuing several market opportunities 
in the last several years  china has become a significant market for our stock preparation equipment 
to capitalize on this growing market  we are establishing a wholly owned subsidiary that will operate a manufacturing and assembly 
table of contents kadant inc annual report facility in china for this equipment and related aftermarket products  as well as for our accessories and water management products in the future 
our total revenues from china were million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
revenues from china are primarily derived from large capital orders  the timing of which is often difficult to predict 
we have also continued to invest in our composite building products business which  we believe  provides us with another internal growth opportunity 
we believe that the market for composite building products will grow as consumer awareness of the advantages of these products increases their acceptance as an alternative to traditional wood products 
we continue to focus on expanding our distribution network  with numerous distribution centers now carrying our composite decking products throughout the us we did  however  experience some problems in the composite building products business that affected our profitability in and will continue to hamper profitability in the first half of adverse weather conditions in much of the us in the first half of delayed the start of the building season 
this situation contributed to an increase in inventory levels throughout the distribution chain just as we increased capacity and operating rates at our composites facility in green bay  wisconsin 
certain of our distributors chose to work down their inventory in  which had an adverse impact on sales particularly in the fourth quarter of  which traditionally has lower revenues than other quarters due to the seasonality of the business 
in response to these business conditions  we curtailed production at the green bay facility in the fourth quarter of we have also curtailed production in the first quarter of as we believe that we have sufficient inventory to meet current customer demand 
in addition  in the second half of we experienced a significant increase in warranty claims associated with excessive contraction of our decking products  which had an adverse impact on profitability 
accordingly  we have increased our estimated costs of product warranties and recorded related warranty expense of million for the year ended january  the lower overhead absorption due to the anticipated lower production levels  reduced pricing due to our annual winter buy discount program  and the increase in warranty expense as a percentage of revenues over last year will have a significant adverse impact on our profitability in the composite building products business in the beginning of these factors considered  we expect our composite building products business to report  on a gaap generally accepted accounting principles basis  an operating loss of to million  on revenues of to million  in the first quarter of  and an operating loss of to million  on revenues of to million  for the year 
for the total company we expect to earn  on a consolidated gaap basis  from 
to 
per diluted share  on revenues of to million in the first quarter of for the full year  we expect to earn 
to per diluted share on a gaap basis  on revenues of to million 
results of operations compared to revenues revenues increased to million in from million in  an increase of million  or 
revenues in include the favorable effect of currency translation of million  or  due to a weaker us dollar relative to most of the functional currencies in countries in which we operate 
pulp and papermaking equipment and systems segment 
revenues at the papermaking equipment segment increased to million in compared with million in  an increase of million  or 
the increase in revenues in includes a increase from the favorable effect of currency translation 
revenues from the segment s stock preparation equipment product line increased by million  or  in as a result of an increase in internal growth and a increase from the favorable effect of currency translation 
the internal growth is entirely due to a million increase in sales to china  offset in part by lower sales in europe and north america due to continued market weakness 
revenues from the segment s water management product line increased million  or  in  due to a increase from the favorable effect of currency translation  and a increase in sales from north america  which were offset by a 
table of contents kadant inc annual report decrease in sales from europe 
revenues from the segment s accessories product line increased by million  or  in  due to a increase from the favorable effect of currency translation  offset by a decrease in sales from north america and europe as a result of machine shutdowns and mill closures caused by industry consolidation and capacity rationalization 
composite and fiber based products segment 
revenues at the composite and fiber based products segment increased to million in from million in  an increase of million  or 
the increase in revenues was the result of a million  or  increase in sales of our composite building products resulting from increased marketing efforts and expansion of our distribution channels 
revenues in the second half of were affected by weaker than expected demand as a result of higher inventory levels at distributors primarily due to the weather related delayed start to the building season 
revenues at our fiber based granular products business decreased million in compared with due to a decrease in sales of our catbox filler product 
gross profit margin gross profit margin remained constant at in and the gross profit margin at the papermaking equipment segment remained constant at in and the gross profit margin at the composite and fiber based products segment decreased to in from in primarily due to the composite building products business 
the lower gross profit margin in at composite building products was primarily due to an increase in warranty costs of million and  to a lesser extent  the higher cost of plastic used in production  offset in part by efficiencies associated with higher levels of production 
the price of plastic used in the production of our composite building products has recently increased 
we do not expect plastic prices to remain at current levels throughout higher than expected plastic prices and or warranty claims would have an adverse impact on the gross profit margin of this segment 
in addition  contributing to the decrease in the gross profit margin at this segment was an increase in the cost of natural gas used in the production of our fiber based granules 
operating expenses selling  general  and administrative expenses were million in  up compared to last year 
this increase consists of an unfavorable foreign currency translation effect of and internal selling  general  and administrative expense increases of 
selling  general  and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues were in compared with in as a result of higher revenues and low internal growth 
research and development expenses as a percentage of revenues were in compared with in primarily due to the increase in revenues in the period

unusual costs of million include noncash charges of million for asset writedowns  consisting of million for the impairment of a laboratory in ohio held for sale at the papermaking equipment segment and million for the writedown of fixed assets held for sale at the composite and fiber based products segment  and million for related disposal and facility closure costs note 
annual savings were approximately million million in cost of revenues  million in selling  general  and administrative expenses  and million in research and development expenses from these actions beginning in the second quarter of interest income and expense interest income decreased to million in from million in primarily due to lower average invested balances as well as lower prevailing interest rates 
the decrease in average invested balances resulted primarily from the use of cash to repurchase and redeem our subordinated convertible debentures in  offset in part by cash generated from operating activities in and proceeds received from our june public stock offering

we do not expect that this will have a material adverse effect on our current liquidity 
although we currently have no material commitments for capital expenditures  we plan to make expenditures during for property  plant  and equipment of approximately million  including million at our composite building products business 
we are establishing an assembly facility in china to support our stock preparation equipment business 
we presently estimate that the china facility will be completed in late and that the capital expenditures associated with establishing this new facility will be approximately million 

table of contents kadant inc annual report contractual obligations and other commercial commitments the following table summarizes the company s known contractual obligations and commercial commitments to make future payments or other consideration pursuant to certain contracts as of january   as well as an estimate of the timing in which these obligations are expected to be satisfied

in the ordinary course of business  we are required to issue limited performance guarantees  which do not require letters of credit  relating to our equipment and systems 
we typically limit our liability under these guarantees to amounts that would not exceed the value of the contract 
we believe that we have adequate reserves for any potential liability in connection with such guarantees 
these guarantees are not included in this table 
provisions in financial guarantees or commitments  debt or lease agreements  or other arrangements could trigger a requirement for an early payment  additional collateral support  amended terms  or acceleration of maturity 
we do not have special purpose entities or use off balance sheet financing techniques  except for the operating leases and other commitments disclosed in the above table 
in the future  our liquidity position will be primarily affected by the level of cash flows from operations and the amount of cash expended on capital expenditures  or on acquisitions  if any 
we believe that our existing resources  together with the cash we expect to generate from operations  are sufficient to meet the capital requirements of our current operations for the foreseeable future 
risk factors in connection with the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of  we wish to caution readers that the following important factors  among others  in some cases have affected  and in the future could affect  our actual results and could cause our actual results in and beyond to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by us  or on our behalf 
our business is dependent on the condition of the pulp and paper industry 
we sell products primarily to the pulp and paper industry  which is a cyclical industry 
generally  the financial condition of the global pulp and paper industry corresponds to the condition of the general economy  as well as to a number of other factors  including pulp and paper production capacity relative to demand 
in recent years  the industry in certain geographic regions  notably north america  has been in a prolonged downcycle resulting in depressed pulp and paper prices  decreased spending  mill closures  consolidations  and bankruptcies  all of which adversely affected our business 
as paper companies consolidate in response to market weakness  they frequently reduce capacity 
table of contents kadant inc annual report and postpone or even cancel capacity addition or expansion projects 
these cyclical downturns can cause our sales to decline and adversely affect our profitability 
our business is subject to economic  currency  political  and other risks associated with international sales and operations 
during  approximately of our sales were to customers outside the united states  principally in europe and asia 
international revenues are subject to a number of risks  including the following agreements may be difficult to enforce and receivables difficult to collect through a foreign country s legal system  foreign customers may have longer payment cycles  foreign countries may impose additional withholding taxes or otherwise tax our foreign income  impose tariffs  or adopt other restrictions on foreign trade  and the protection of intellectual property in foreign countries may be more difficult to enforce 
although we seek to charge our customers in the same currency in which our operating costs are incurred  fluctuations in currency exchange rates may affect product demand and adversely affect the profitability in us dollars of products we provide in international markets where payment for our products and services is made in their local currencies 
any of these factors could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations 
an increasing portion of our international sales has and may in the future come from china 
an increase in revenues  as well as our planned operation of a manufacturing and assembly facility in china  will expose us to increased risk in the event of changes in the policies of the chinese government  political unrest  unstable economic conditions  or other developments in china or in us china relations that are adverse to trade  including enactment of protectionist legislation or trade restrictions 
in addition  orders from customers in china  particularly for large systems that have been tailored to a customer s specific requirements  involve increased risk of cancellation prior to shipment due to payment terms that are applicable to doing business in china 
the timing of these orders is often difficult to predict 
we are subject to intense competition in all our markets 
we believe that the principal competitive factors affecting the markets for our products include quality  price  service  technical expertise  and product innovation 
our competitors include a number of large multinational corporations that may have substantially greater financial  marketing  and other resources than we do 
as a result  they may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements  or to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their services and products 
competitors technologies may prove to be superior to ours 
our current products  those under development  and our ability to develop new technologies may not be sufficient to enable us to compete effectively 
competition  especially in china  could increase if new companies enter the market or if existing competitors expand their product lines or intensify efforts within existing product lines 
in addition  our composite building products business is subject to intense competition  particularly in the decking market  from traditional wood products and other composite lumber manufacturers  many of whom have greater financial  technical  and marketing resources than we do 
as a result  we may be unable to compete successfully in this market 
our success in the market for composite building products will depend on our ability to manufacture and distribute our composite building products 
in  we began to develop  produce  market  and sell composite products primarily for the building industry 
development  manufacturing  and commercialization of our composite building products require significant testing and technical expertise in the formulation and manufacture of the products  and our efforts may not be successful 
further  growth of our composite building products business requires ongoing market acceptance 
we expect to incur significant branding and distribution expenses to successfully market and distribute these products and our strategy may not be successful 
we have limited experience manufacturing these products at volume  cost  and quality levels sufficient to satisfy expected 
table of contents kadant inc annual report demand  and we may encounter difficulties in connection with any large scale manufacturing or commercialization of these new products 
our capacity may not be sufficient to meet demand without significant additional investment 
in addition  the majority of our production is dependent upon a single piece of equipment 
if that equipment were to fail for an extended period of time  it would have a material adverse effect on our revenues from this business in that period 
we rely on distributors in the building products industry to market  distribute  and sell our products 
we may be unable to produce our products in sufficient quantity to interest or retain these distributors or to add new distributors 
if we are unable to distribute our products effectively  our revenues will decline and we will have to incur additional expenses to market these products directly 
economic conditions could adversely affect demand for our composite building products 
demand for our composite building products is affected by several factors beyond our control  including economic conditions 
recent demand for our products has been driven  in part  by the availability of low interest mortgage and home equity loans 
an increase in interest rates or tightened credit could adversely affect demand for home remodeling projects  including demand for our products 
seasonality and weather conditions could adversely affect our business 
in general  the building products industry experiences seasonal fluctuations in sales  particularly in the fourth and first quarters  when holidays and adverse weather conditions in some regions usually reduce the level of home improvement and new construction activity 
in addition  our composite building products are used or installed in outdoor construction applications  and our sales volume  bookings  gross margins  and operating income can be negatively affected by adverse weather conditions 
for example  an unusually long winter followed by a wet spring in many regions of the us delayed the start of the building season and adversely affected our business in the first half of operating results will tend to be lower in quarters with lower sales  which are not entirely offset by a corresponding reduction in operating costs 
in addition  we may also experience lower gross profit margins in the fourth and first quarters due to seasonal incentive discounts offered to our distributors 
as a result of these factors  we believe sequential period to period comparisons of our operating results are not reliable indicators of future performance  and the operating results for any one quarterly period may not be indicative of operating results to be expected for a full year 
the failure of our composite building products to perform could result in potential liabilities 
our composite building products are new  have not been on the market for long periods of time  and may be used for applications in which we may have little knowledge or limited experience 
because we have limited historical experience  we may be unable to predict the potential liabilities related to product warranty or product liability issues 
if our products fail to perform over their warranty periods  we may not have the ability to protect ourselves adequately against this potential liability  which could adversely affect our operating results 
we have recently experienced a significant increase in warranty claims and warranty expense related to our composite decking products 
a continued increase in warranty claims or expenses and or failure of our products to perform or to be accepted in the marketplace will have an adverse impact on the profitability of our business 
we are dependent on a single mill for the raw material used in our fiber based granules  and we may not be able to obtain raw material on commercially reasonable terms  and the manufacture of our composite building products and fiber based granules is subject to commodity price risks 
we are dependent on a single paper mill for the fiber used in the manufacture of our fiber based granules and composite building products 
this mill has the exclusive right to supply the papermaking byproducts used in our process to manufacture the granules 
although we believe our relationship with the mill is good  the mill could decide not to renew its contract with us at the end of  or may not renew on commercially reasonable terms 
if this were to occur  we would be forced to find an alternative supply for this raw material 
we may be unable to find an alternative supply on commercially reasonable terms or could incur excessive transportation costs if an alternative supplier were found  which would increase our manufacturing costs and might prevent our products from being competitive 
in addition  we use natural gas in the production of our fiber based granular products 
we manage our exposure to natural gas price fluctuations by entering into short term forward contracts to purchase specified 
table of contents kadant inc annual report quantities of natural gas from a supplier 
we may not be able to effectively manage our exposure to natural gas price fluctuations 
our composite building products also contain plastics  which are subject to wide fluctuations in pricing and availability 
higher energy costs can increase the price of plastic significantly and rapidly 
in  for example the price of plastic used in the production of our composite building products increased significantly 
we may be unable to obtain sufficient quantities at reasonable prices  which would adversely affect our profitability and ability to produce a sufficient quantity of our products or produce our products at competitive prices 
our inability to successfully identify and complete acquisitions or successfully integrate any new or previous acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our strategy includes the acquisition of technologies and businesses that complement or augment our existing products and services 
promising acquisitions are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons  including competition among prospective buyers and the need for regulatory  including antitrust  approvals 
any acquisition we may complete may be made at a substantial premium over the fair value of the net assets of the acquired company 
we may not be able to complete future acquisitions  integrate any acquired businesses successfully into our existing businesses  make such businesses profitable  or realize anticipated cost savings or synergies  if any  from these acquisitions 
in addition  we have previously acquired several companies and businesses 
as a result of these acquisitions  we have recorded significant goodwill on our balance sheet  and in conjunction with the adoption of sfas no 
in  we recorded a transitional impairment charge upon the adoption of this standard 
any future impairment losses identified after will be recorded as reductions to operating income  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
our ability to realize the value of the goodwill that we have recorded will depend on the future cash flows of these businesses 
these cash flows depend  in part  on how well we have integrated these businesses 
our inability to protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  third parties may claim that we infringe their intellectual property  and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expense as a result 
we place considerable emphasis on obtaining patent and trade secret protection for significant new technologies  products  and processes because of the length of time and expense associated with bringing new products through the development process and into the marketplace 
our success depends in part on our ability to develop patentable products and obtain and enforce patent protection for our products both in the united states and in other countries 
we own numerous us and foreign patents  and we intend to file additional applications  as appropriate  for patents covering our products 
patents may not be issued for any pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us  and the claims allowed under any issued patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology 
any issued patents owned by or licensed to us may be challenged  invalidated  or circumvented  and the rights under these patents may not provide us with competitive advantages 
a patent relating to our fiber based granular products expires in mid after that date  we could be subject to increased competition in this market  which could have an adverse effect on this business 
in addition  competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies 
intellectual property rights may also be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries  which could make it easier for competitors to capture increased market position 
we could incur substantial costs to defend ourselves in suits brought against us or in suits in which we may assert our patent rights against others 
an unfavorable outcome of any such litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
in addition  as our patents expire  we rely on trade secrets and proprietary know how to protect our products 
we cannot be sure the steps we have taken or will take in the future will be adequate to deter misappropriation of our proprietary information and intellectual property 
we seek to protect trade secrets and proprietary know how  in part  through confidentiality agreements with our collaborators  employees  and consultants 
these agreements may be breached  we may not have adequate remedies for any breach  and our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by our competitors 

table of contents kadant inc annual report third parties may assert claims against us to the effect that we are infringing on their intellectual property rights 
we could incur substantial costs and diversion of management resources in defending these claims  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
in addition  parties making these claims could secure a judgment awarding substantial damages  as well as injunctive or other equitable relief  which could effectively block our ability to make  use  sell  distribute  or market our products and services in the united states or abroad 
in the event that a claim relating to intellectual property is asserted against us  or third parties not affiliated with us hold pending or issued patents that relate to our products or technology  we may seek licenses to such intellectual property or challenge those patents 
however  we may be unable to obtain these licenses on commercially reasonable terms  if at all  and our challenge of the patents may be unsuccessful 
our failure to obtain the necessary licenses or other rights could prohibit the sale  manufacture  or distribution of our products and  therefore  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
fluctuations in our quarterly operating results may cause our stock price to decline 
given the nature of the markets in which we participate and the effect of staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab no 
we may not be able to reliably predict future revenues and profitability  and unexpected changes may cause us to adjust our operations 
a significant proportion of our costs are fixed  due in part to our significant selling  research and development  and manufacturing costs 
thus  small declines in revenues could disproportionately affect our operating results 
other factors that could affect our quarterly operating results include failure of our products to pass contractually agreed upon acceptance tests  which would delay or prohibit recognition of revenues under sab no 
demand for and market acceptance of our products  competitive pressures resulting in lower sales prices of our products  adverse changes in the pulp and paper industry  delays or problems in our introduction of new products  our competitors announcements of new products  services  or technological innovations  contractual liabilities incurred by us related to guarantees of our product performance  increased costs of raw materials or supplies  including the cost of energy  and changes in the timing of product orders 
anti takeover provisions in our charter documents  under delaware law  and in our shareholder rights plan could prevent or delay transactions that our shareholders may favor 
provisions of our charter and by laws may discourage  delay  or prevent a merger or acquisition that our shareholders may consider favorable  including transactions in which shareholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares 
for example  these provisions authorize the issuance of blank check preferred stock without any need for action by shareholders  provide for a classified board of directors with staggered three year terms  require supermajority shareholder voting to effect various amendments to our charter and by laws  eliminate the ability of our shareholders to call special meetings of shareholders  prohibit shareholder action by written consent  and establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by shareholders at shareholder meetings 
in addition  our board of directors has adopted a shareholder rights plan intended to protect shareholders in the event of an unfair or coercive offer to acquire our company and to provide our board of directors with adequate time to evaluate unsolicited offers 
preferred stock purchase rights have been distributed to our common shareholders pursuant to the rights plan 
this rights plan may have anti takeover effects 
the rights plan will cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire us on terms that our board of directors 
table of contents kadant inc annual report does not believe are in our best interests and those of our shareholders and may discourage  delay  or prevent a merger or acquisition that shareholders may consider favorable  including transactions in which shareholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  which could affect our future results of operations and financial condition 
we manage our exposure to these risks through our regular operating and financing activities 
additionally  we use short term forward contracts to manage certain exposures to foreign currencies 
we enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge firm purchase and sale commitments denominated in currencies other than our subsidiaries local currencies 
we do not engage in extensive foreign currency hedging activities  however  the purpose of our foreign currency hedging activities is to protect our local currency cash flows related to these commitments from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
our forward foreign exchange contracts principally hedge transactions denominated in us dollars 
gains and losses arising from forward contracts are recognized as offsets to gains and losses resulting from the transactions being hedged 
we do not enter into speculative foreign currency agreements 
interest rates our cash and cash equivalents are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
interest rate changes would result in a change in interest income due to the difference between the current interest rates on cash and cash equivalents and the variable rates to which these financial instruments may adjust in the future 
a decrease in year end interest rates would have resulted in a negative impact on our net income of million in both and currency exchange rates we generally view our investment in foreign subsidiaries in a functional currency other than our reporting currency as long term 
our investment in foreign subsidiaries is sensitive to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries are principally denominated in euros  british pounds sterling  mexican pesos  and canadian dollars 
the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates on our net investment in foreign subsidiaries is reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive items component of shareholders investment 
a depreciation in year end and functional currencies  relative to the us dollar  would have resulted in a reduction in shareholders investment of million and million  respectively 
the fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is sensitive to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
the fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is the estimated amount that we would pay or receive upon termination of the contracts  taking into account the change in foreign currency exchange rates 
a depreciation in year end and foreign currency exchange rates related to our contracts would have resulted in no impact for and an increase in unrealized losses on forward foreign exchange contracts of million in since we use forward foreign exchange contracts as hedges of firm purchase and sale commitments  the unrealized gain or loss on forward foreign currency exchange contracts resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates would be offset by corresponding changes in the fair value of the hedged items
