item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we design  develop  produce and market innovative products  systems and services for advanced communications solutions 
we conduct our business through three complementary segments telecommunications transmission  mobile data communications and rf microwave amplifiers 
we sell our products into commercial and government markets where we believe we have technological  engineering  systems design or other expertise that differentiate our product offerings 
we believe we are a leader in the market segments that we serve 
our telecommunications transmission segment  our largest business segment  provides specialized products and systems for satellite  over the horizon microwave and wireless line of sight microwave telecommunications systems 
our mobile data communications segment provides satellite based mobile location  tracking and messaging services and mobile satellite transceivers primarily for defense applications  including logistics  support and battlefield command and control 
our rf microwave amplifier segment designs  manufactures and markets solid state  high power  broadband rf microwave amplifier products 
a substantial portion of our sales may be derived from a limited number of relatively large customer contracts  the timing of revenues from which cannot be predicted 
quarterly sales and operating results may be significantly affected by one or more of such contracts 
accordingly  we can experience significant fluctuations in sales and operating results from quarter to quarter and period to period comparisons may not be indicative of future performance 
we generally recognize income on contracts only when the products are shipped 
however  when the performance of a contract will extend beyond a month period  revenue is recognized on the percentage of completion method 
profits expected to be realized on contracts are based on total estimated sales value as compared to total estimated costs at completion 
these estimates are reviewed and revised periodically throughout the lives of the contracts  and adjustments to profits resulting from such revisions are made cumulative to the date of the change 
estimated losses on long term contracts in progress are recorded in the period in which such losses become known 
since our contract with the us army for the movement tracking system is for an eight year period  revenue recognition is based on the percentage of completion method 
the gross margin is based on the estimated sales and expenses for the entire eight year contract 
the amount of revenue recognized has been limited to the amount of funded orders received from the us army 
the portion of such orders representing prepaid service time revenue is being deferred until the service time is used by the customer 
significant changes in the estimates used to derive the gross profit margin can materially impact our operating results and financial condition in future periods see critical accounting policies below for more information 
our gross profit is affected by a variety of factors  including the mix of products  systems and services sold  production efficiency  price competition and general economic conditions 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits for marketing  sales and administrative employees  advertising and trade show costs  professional fees and other administrative costs 
our research and development expenses relate to both existing product enhancement and new product development 
a portion of our research and development effort is related to specific contracts and is recoverable under those contracts because it is funded by the customers 
such customer funded expenditures are not included in research and development expenses for financial reporting purposes  but are reflected in cost of sales 
in july  we acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of advanced hardware architectures  inc aha for million in cash 
the acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
accordingly  we allocated the purchase price to the assets purchased and the liabilities assumed based upon the estimated fair values at the date of acquisition 
the excess of the purchase price over the fair values of the net assets acquired was approximately million  of which million was allocated to in process research and development and expensed as of the acquisition date 
the results of operations in our telecommunications transmission segment include the aha related business commencing in august in may  we acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of memotec  inc memotec  a subsidiary of kontron ag  and at the same time  purchased related inventory owned by kontron canada inc  for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million in cash 
the acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
accordingly  we allocated the purchase price to the assets purchased and the liabilities assumed based upon the estimated fair values at the date of acquisition 
the excess of the purchase price over the fair values of the net assets acquired was approximately million  of which million was allocated to in process research and development and expensed as of the acquisition date 
the results of operations in our telecommunications transmission segment include the memotec related business commencing in may critical accounting policies we consider certain accounting policies to be critical due to the estimation process involved in each 
revenue recognition on long term contracts 
as discussed above  when the performance of a contract will extend beyond a month period  revenue and related costs are recognized on the percentage of completion method of accounting 
revenue is recognized based on the relationship of total costs incurred to total projected costs  or  alternatively  based on output measures  such as units delivered 
profits expected to be realized on such contracts are based on total estimated sales for the contract compared to total estimated costs  including warranty costs  at completion of the contract 
these estimates are reviewed and revised periodically throughout the lives of the contracts  and adjustments to profits resulting from such revisions are made cumulative to the date of the change 
estimated losses on long term contracts are recorded in the period in which the losses become known 
some of our largest contracts  including our contract with the us army for the movement tracking system  are accounted for using the percentage of completion method 
we have been engaged in the production and delivery of goods and services on a continual basis under contractual arrangements for many years 
historically  we have demonstrated an ability to accurately estimate revenues and expenses relating to our long term contracts 
however  there exist inherent risks and uncertainties in estimating revenues and expenses and progress toward completion  particularly on larger or longer term contracts 
if we do not accurately estimate the total sales  related costs and progress towards completion on such contracts  the estimated gross margins may be significantly impacted or losses may need to be recognized in future periods 
any such resulting changes in margins or contract losses could be material to our results of operations and financial position 
in addition  most government contracts have termination for convenience clauses that provide the customer with the right to terminate the contract at any time 
such terminations could impact the assumptions regarding total contract revenues and expenses utilized in recognizing profit under the percentage of completion method of accounting 
changes to these assumptions could materially impact our results of operations and financial position 
historically  we have not experienced material terminations of our long term contracts 
we also address customer acceptance provisions in assessing our ability to perform our contractual obligations under long term contracts 
our inability to perform on our long term contracts could materially impact our results of operations and financial position 
historically  we have been able to perform on our long term contracts 
impairment of intangible assets 
as of july   our company s intangible assets  including goodwill  aggregated million 
in assessing the recoverability of goodwill and other intangibles  we must make various assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors in determining the fair values of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets in future periods 
any such resulting impairment charges could be material to our results of operations 
provisions for excess and obsolete inventory 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based on historical and future usage trends 
several factors may influence the sale and use of our inventories  including decisions to exit a product line  technological change and new product development 
these factors could result in a change in the amount of excess and obsolete inventory on hand 
additionally  our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have understated or overstated the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
in the future  if we determine that our inventory was overvalued  we would be required to recognize such costs in our financial statements at the time of such determination 
any such charges could be material to our results of operations and financial position 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon customer payment history and current creditworthiness  as determined by our review of our customers current credit information 
generally  we will require cash in advance or payment secured by irrevocable letters of credit before an order is accepted from an international customer that we do not do business with regularly 
in addition  we seek to obtain insurance for certain international customers that we have determined could be a credit risk 
however  we are not able to obtain irrevocable letters of credit or credit insurance in all instances 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the allowances established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
measurement of such losses requires consideration of historical loss experience  including the need to adjust for current conditions  and judgments about the probable effects of relevant observable data  including present economic conditions such as delinquency rates and financial health of specific customers 
changes to the estimated allowance for doubtful accounts could be material to our results of operations and financial position 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain income and expense items expressed as a percentage of our net sales year ended july  net sales gross margin selling  general and administrative expenses research and development expenses in process research and development amortization of intangibles operating income interest expense income  net income before income taxes net income comparison of fiscal and net sales 
consolidated net sales were million and million for fiscal and  respectively  representing an increase of million  or 
the increase was driven by significant growth in our telecommunications transmission and mobile data communications segments  as described below 
sales from our telecommunications transmission segment were million for fiscal  as compared to sales of million for fiscal  an increase of million  or 
the significant sales growth in this segment resulted primarily from i increased demand for our satellite earth station products and ii incremental sales of over the horizon microwave systems relating to two contract awards received in fiscal our telecommunications transmission segment represented of total net sales for fiscal as compared to for fiscal mobile data communications segment sales increased million  or  from million for fiscal to million for fiscal the significant sales growth in this segment was primarily the result of i increased demand for battlefield command and control applications by the us army and ii the continued rollout of our movement tracking system to the us army 
our mobile data communications segment represented of total net sales for fiscal as compared to for fiscal sales from our rf microwave amplifier segment were million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal  representing a decrease of million  or 
the decrease was the result of continued softness in certain of our commercial product lines  partially offset by increasing demand for our defense related products 
our rf microwave amplifier segment represented of total net sales for fiscal as compared to for fiscal international sales including sales to domestic companies for inclusion in products which are sold to international customers represented and of total net sales for fiscal and  respectively 
domestic commercial sales represented and of total net sales for fiscal and  respectively 
sales to the us government including sales to prime contractors to the us government represented and of total net sales for fiscal and  respectively 
during fiscal and  sales to one customer  a prime contractor  represented and of total net sales  respectively 
direct and indirect sales to a north african country  including certain sales to the prime contractor mentioned above  during fiscal and represented and  respectively  of total net sales 
gross profit 
gross profit was million and million for fiscal and  respectively  representing an increase of million  or 
the increase in gross profit was due to the significant increase in net sales  as well as an increase in the gross profit percentage 
gross profit  as a percentage of net sales  was for fiscal  as compared to for fiscal the increase in the gross profit  as a percentage of sales  was primarily due to i the higher proportion of our sales being in the telecommunications transmission segment  which typically realize higher margins than sales in our other two segments  ii a more favorable product mix within the mobile data communications segment  and iii increased operating efficiencies and overhead absorption in both the telecommunications transmission and mobile data communications segments 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in gross profit in our rf microwave amplifier segment due to higher than anticipated costs to complete two contracts 
as mentioned above  in fiscal  we realized increased operating efficiencies in our two largest segments 
in our telecommunications transmission segment  such efficiencies were achieved  in part  by our continuing efforts to expand the usage of our high volume manufacturing facility in tempe  arizona 
the increased utilization and resulting operating efficiencies were the result of higher demand for our satellite earth station products  as well as the continued use of the facility by our other two segments for certain high volume manufacturing requirements 
in our mobile data communications segment  such efficiencies were the result of incremental mts and battlefield command and control application funding from the us army 
if the current levels of mts and battlefield command and control funding are maintained or increased  we believe that we will continue to realize increased operating efficiencies 
as discussed above under critical accounting policies revenue recognition on long term contracts  we periodically review and adjust total estimated contract revenues and costs on long term contracts 
in fiscal  we adjusted the estimated margins at completion on certain large contracts 
in the telecommunications transmission segment  we increased the estimated margins at completion on two large over the horizon microwave system contracts as they draw nearer to completion 
in the mobile data communications segment  we increased the estimated margins at completion on the mts contract with the us army as a result of increased funding 
these adjustments resulted in an aggregate million cumulative increase to the gross profits recognized on these contracts in prior years 
such amount is included in the fiscal results of operations 
further adjustments to the estimated gross margins are possible in future periods as these contracts are completed 
included in cost of sales for fiscal and are provisions for excess and obsolete inventory of million and million  respectively 
as discussed under critical accounting policies provisions for excess and obsolete inventory  we regularly review our inventory and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based on historical usage assumptions 
the provision for fiscal includes million relating to certain product line discontinuances in our telecommunications transmission segment 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million and million for fiscal and  respectively  representing an increase of million  or 
the increase was due to higher expenses relating to the significant increases in sales and profitability during fiscal  including expenses related to recent acquisitions 
also contributing to the increase were higher insurance costs and compliance costs incurred in connection with recently enacted corporate governance regulations 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses were for fiscal and research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
approximately million and million of such amounts  respectively  related to our telecommunications transmission segment 
as an investment for the future  we are continually enhancing our existing products and developing new products and technologies 
whenever possible  we seek customer funding for research and development to adapt our products to specialized customer requirements 
during fiscal and  customers reimbursed us million and million  respectively  which amounts are not reflected in the reported research and development expenses  but are included in net sales with the related costs included in cost of sales 
in process research and development expense 
in connection with the purchase of certain assets and liabilities of memotec in fiscal  we recorded a charge of million for the write off of in process research and development 
there was no in process research and development expense in fiscal amortization of intangibles 
amortization of intangibles for fiscal and was million and million  respectively 
the amortization relates to intangibles with definite lives which we acquired in connection with various acquisitions 
operating income 
operating income for fiscal and was million and million  respectively 
the million increase was the result of the higher sales and gross profit  discussed above  partially offset by higher operating expenses 
operating income in our telecommunications transmission segment increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal as a result of significantly higher sales combined with increased operating efficiencies and overhead absorption 
our mobile data communications segment generated operating income of million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal due primarily to the increase in sales  more favorable product mix and the impact of the cumulative gross margin adjustment discussed above under gross profit 
operating income in our rf microwave amplifier segment decreased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal primarily as a result of the decrease in sales and higher than anticipated costs to complete two contracts 
unallocated operating expenses increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal due primarily to higher incentive compensation expense  increased costs associated with recent corporate governance regulations and higher insurance costs 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal the decrease was due to the prepayment of our term loan  which bore interest at approximately  in july interest expense for fiscal primarily represents interest expense associated with our convertible senior notes issued in january interest income 
interest income for fiscal was million  as compared to million for fiscal the million increase was due primarily to a higher average cash position resulting from the proceeds received from our private placement of common stock in july and issuance of our convertible senior notes in january provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes was million and million for fiscal and  respectively  as a result of the significant increase in pre tax profit 
the effective tax rate was in both periods 
comparison of fiscal and net sales 
consolidated net sales were million and million for fiscal and  respectively  representing an increase of million or 
the increase was driven by significant growth in our telecommunications transmission and mobile data communications segments  as described below 
sales from our telecommunications transmission segment were million in fiscal  as compared to sales of million in fiscal  an increase of million or 
the sales growth in this segment resulted from i incremental sales of our over the horizon microwave systems in connection with two large contract awards in fiscal  ii sales relating to aha which we purchased in july and iii increased sales of our satellite earth station products 
our telecommunications transmission segment represented of total net sales in fiscal as compared to in fiscal mobile data communications segment sales increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the sales growth in this segment was the result of higher sales of our movement tracking system to the us army  as well as sales to a major us prime contractor that is providing a battle command application to the us army 
our mobile data communications segment represented of total net sales in fiscal as compared to in fiscal sales from our rf microwave amplifier segment were million in fiscal versus million in fiscal the increase was the result of strong defense related sales partially offset by weakness in our commercial product lines  such as our commercial aviation product line 
our rf microwave amplifier segment represented of total net sales in fiscal as compared to in fiscal in fiscal  one customer  a prime contractor  represented of total net sales 
in fiscal  no customer  other than the us government  represented more than of total net sales 
international sales represented and of total net sales in fiscal and  respectively 
domestic commercial sales represented and of total net sales in fiscal and  respectively 
sales to the us government including prime contractors to the us government represented and of total net sales in fiscal and  respectively 
gross profit 
gross profit was million and million in fiscal and  respectively  representing an increase of million 
the increase was primarily due to the higher sales levels in fiscal as compared to fiscal gross margin  as a percentage of net sales  was and in fiscal and  respectively 
although fiscal contained a significantly higher proportion of mobile data communications segment sales  which generally are at lower gross margins than our other businesses  the overall increase in sales resulted in greater operating efficiencies and overhead absorption 
included in cost of sales for fiscal and  respectively  are provisions for excess and obsolete inventory of million and million 
as discussed above under critical accounting policies provisions for excess and obsolete inventory  we regularly review our inventory and record a provision  approximately million and million for fiscal and  respectively  for excess and obsolete inventory based on historical usage and future usage assumptions 
the provision for fiscal also includes million relating to certain product line discontinuances in our telecommunications transmission segment 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million and million in fiscal and  respectively  representing an increase of million 
the increase was due to the addition of aha  as well as higher expenses relating to the higher sales and profit levels in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses were and in fiscal and  respectively 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
approximately million and million of such amounts  respectively  related to our telecommunications transmission segment 
as an investment for the future  we are continually enhancing our existing products and developing new products and technologies 
whenever possible  we seek customer funding for research and development to adapt our products to specialized customer requirements 
during fiscal and  customers reimbursed us million and million  respectively  which amounts are not reflected in the reported research and development expenses  but are included in sales with the related estimated costs included in cost of sales 
in process research and development 
in connection with the purchase of certain assets and liabilities of aha in fiscal  we recorded a charge of million for the write off of in process research and development in fiscal there was no in process research and development expense in fiscal amortization of intangibles 
amortization of intangibles was million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the increase was primarily the result of the amortization related to intangibles with definite lives we acquired in connection with the acquisition of aha 
operating income 
operating income in fiscal and was million and million  respectively 
the increase was the result of the higher sales and gross profit  discussed above  partially offset by higher operating expenses 
operating income in our telecommunications transmission segment increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal as a result of higher sales  as discussed above  combined with increased operating efficiencies and overhead absorption 
in addition  fiscal operating income included a million charge for in process research and development 
our mobile data communications segment s operating income increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal as a result of the significant increase in sales  as discussed above 
operating income in our rf microwave amplifier segment increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal as a result of a more favorable product mix in fiscal unallocated expenses increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal as a result of higher incentive compensation expense  as well as increased costs in connection with recent corporate governance regulations 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease was the result of a partial debt prepayment during the first quarter of fiscal in addition  we prepaid the balance of our long term debt in july interest income 
interest income was million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the decrease was primarily the result of lower interest rates in fiscal provision for income taxes 
the effective tax rate of for fiscal reflects the tax benefits of among other items  research and experimentation tax credits 
the research and experimentation tax credits in fiscal more than offset the tax expense on the lower level of pre tax income  resulting in a tax benefit of million 
liquidity and capital resources our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents increased to million at july  from million at july  net cash provided by operating activities  excluding the effects of the memotec acquisition  was million for fiscal such amount reflects i net income of million plus the impact of depreciation  amortization  the provisions for doubtful accounts and inventory reserves  in process research and development expense and the income tax benefit from stock related transactions aggregating million and ii changes in working capital balances  most notably increases in accounts receivable of million and inventory of million 
also impacting net cash provided by operating activities were increases in accrued expenses  customer advances and deposits and deferred service revenue aggregating million 
the increase in billed receivables was the result of the increase in sales during fiscal and the timing of related cash receipts  as well as billings related to one of our large over the horizon microwave system contracts as it draws nearer to completion 
the decrease in unbilled receivables was due to the liquidation of previously unbilled amounts on the same over the horizon microwave system contract 
a significant portion of the credit risk associated with such contract is covered by credit insurance 
net cash used in investing activities for fiscal was million 
we used million for capital expenditures and million for the acquisition of memotec 
we expect to complete the build out of our state of the art network operations center located in our germantown  maryland facility  as well as our company wide information reporting system  during the first half of fiscal we currently expect capital expenditures for fiscal to be between million and million 
net cash provided by financing activities was million  due primarily to the net proceeds of million from the sale of our convertible senior notes in january  as well as the proceeds from stock option exercises and employee stock purchase plan shares aggregating million 
these amounts were partially offset by principal payments on capital lease obligations of million 
financing arrangement on january   we issued million of our convertible senior notes in a private offering pursuant to rule a under the securities act of  as amended 
the net proceeds from this transaction were million after deducting the initial purchaser s discount and other transaction costs 
for further information concerning this financing  see notes to consolidated financial statements note a convertible senior notes due commitments in the normal course of business  we routinely enter into binding and non binding purchase obligations primarily covering anticipated purchases of inventory and equipment 
we do not expect that these commitments as of july  will materially or adversely affect our liquidity 
at july  we had contractual cash obligations to repay our convertible senior notes  capital lease and operating lease obligations 
payments due under these long term obligations are as follows obligations due by fiscal years in thousands total and and after convertible senior notes capital lease obligations operating lease commitments total contractual cash obligations we have entered into standby letter of credit agreements with financial institutions relating to the guarantee of future performance on certain contracts 
at july   the balance of these agreements was million 
cash we have pledged against such agreements aggregating million has been classified as restricted cash in the consolidated balance sheet 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our operating cash requirements for the foreseeable future 
in the event that we identify a significant acquisition that requires additional cash  we would seek to borrow funds or raise additional equity capital 
impact of recent hurricanes in august and september  two of our leased facilities located in florida experienced damage from hurricanes charley and frances the hurricanes 
the damage was to both leaseholds and personal property 
we are working with our landlords and property insurance company in assessing the cost to repair and clean up the facilities 
although we believe that most of these costs will be covered by insurance  the related policies do include deductibles and coinsurance provisions 
the net cost to us relating to the hurricane damage  which is not expected to exceed million  will be expensed in our consolidated statement of operations for the quarter ending october  other than minor disruptions immediately following the storms  the hurricanes and clean up have not and are not expected to impact our ability to meet customer demands and contract requirements 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
sfas no 
provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation as originally provided by sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation 
additionally  sfas no 
amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
in both annual and interim financial statements 
we adopted the disclosure portion of this statement during fiscal the adoption did not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements 
on march   the fasb issued a proposed statement  share based payment an amendment to statement nos 
and  that addresses the accounting for share based payment transactions in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for a equity instruments of the enterprise or b liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprise s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
the proposed statement would eliminate the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and generally would require  instead  that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method 
as proposed  this standard would be applied prospectively for fiscal years beginning after december  the company s fiscal year  as if all share based compensation awards granted  modified or settled after december  had been accounted for using the fair value based method of accounting 
we will monitor the fasb s progress on the issuance of this proposed statement and its impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in july  the emerging issues task force eitf of the fasb announced that it had reached a tentative consensus with respect to issue no 
 the effect of contingently convertible debt on diluted earnings per share 
the eitf s tentative consensus states that shares of common stock contingently issuable pursuant to contingent convertible securities should be included in diluted earnings per share computations if dilutive regardless of whether their market price triggers or other contingent features have been met 
additionally  in its efforts to converge with international accounting standards  the fasb has issued an exposure draft  earnings per share an amendment of fasb statement no 
this exposure draft requires contracts that contain an option to settle in cash or stock be assumed to settle in stock for diluted earnings per share computations 
as discussed in note a to the consolidated financial statements  we issued million of our convertible senior notes in january if these proposals become effective  we would be required to include an additional million shares relating to our convertible senior notes using the if converted method under which net income would also be adjusted to exclude the related interest expense in our computation of diluted earnings per share for our fiscal year ending july  and subsequent years and would be required to restate earnings per share for fiscal for comparative purposes 
no restatement of diluted earnings per share for fiscal or would be required since our convertible senior notes were not outstanding during these periods 
the exact amount of a restatement  if any  would be based on the provisions of any final changes in the applicable accounting principles 
forward looking statements and risk factors this form k contains forward looking statements including statements concerning the future of our industry  product development  business strategy  continued acceptance of our products  market growth  and dependence on significant customers 
these statements can be identified by the use of forward looking terminology such as may  expect  anticipate  estimate  continue  or other similar words 
when considering forward looking statements  you should keep in mind the risk factors and other cautionary statements in this form k 
the risk factors noted below and other factors noted throughout this form k could cause our actual results to differ significantly from those contained in any forward looking statement 
due to many factors  including the amount of business represented by large contracts  new orders  net sales and our operating results are difficult to forecast and may be volatile 
we have experienced  and will experience in the future  significant fluctuations in new orders  net sales and operating results  including our net income and earnings per share  from quarter to quarter 
one reason for this is that a significant portion of our business primarily the over the horizon microwave systems of our telecommunications transmission business segment  a portion of our rf microwave amplifier business segment and the majority of our mobile data communications segment is derived from a limited number of relatively large customer contracts  the timing of which cannot be predicted 
while we generally recognize revenue on contracts when the products are shipped  revenue is recognized on the percentage of completion method when the performance of a contract will extend beyond a month period 
our new orders  net sales and operating results  including our net income and earnings per share  also may vary significantly from period to period because of the following factors product mix sold  fluctuating market demand  price competition  new product introductions by our competitors  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  unexpected changes in delivery of components or subsystems  political instability  regulatory developments  and general economic conditions 
accordingly  you should not rely on period to period comparisons as indications of our future performance because these comparisons may not be meaningful 
our business  results of operations  liquidity and financial condition depend on our ability to maintain our level of government business 
in recent years  we have increased our dependence on us government business 
our sales to the us government including sales to prime contractors to the us government accounted for approximately  and of our total net sales for the fiscal years ended july   and  respectively 
approximately of our backlog at july  consisted of orders from the us government 
we expect such business to represent a significant portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future 
us government business exposes us to various risks  including unexpected contract or project terminations or suspensions  unpredictable order placements  reductions or cancellations  reductions in government funds available for our projects due to government policy changes  budget cuts and other spending priorities  penalties arising from post award contract audits  cost audits in which the value of our contracts may be reduced  higher than expected final costs  particularly relating to software and hardware development  for work performed under contracts where we commit to specified deliveries for a fixed price  and unpredictable cash collections of unbilled receivables that may be subject to acceptance of contract deliverables by the customer and contract close out procedures  including government approval of final indirect rates 
all of our us government contracts can be terminated by the us government for its convenience 
termination for convenience provisions provide only for our recovery of costs incurred or committed  settlement expenses and profit on work completed prior to termination 
in addition to the right of the us government to terminate  us government contracts are conditioned upon the continuing approval by congress of the necessary spending 
congress usually appropriates funds for a given program on a fiscal year basis even though contract performance may take more than one year 
consequently  at the beginning of a major program  the contract may not be fully funded  and additional monies are normally committed to the contract only if  as and when appropriations are made by congress for future fiscal years 
the us government may review our costs and performance on certain contracts  as well as our accounting and general business practices 
based on the result of such audits  the us government may adjust our contract related costs and fees 
we obtain us government contracts through a competitive bidding process 
we cannot assure you that we will continue to win competitively awarded contracts or that awarded contracts will generate sufficient net sales to result in profitability 
all of our businesses are subject to rapid technological change  we must keep pace with changes to compete successfully 
we are engaged in businesses characterized by rapid technological change  evolving industry standards  frequent new product announcements and enhancements  and changing customer demands 
the introduction of products and services embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards could render our products and services obsolete or non competitive 
the technology used in our products and services evolves rapidly  and our business position depends  in large part  on the continuous refinement of our scientific and engineering expertise and the development  either through internal research and development or acquisitions  of new or enhanced products and technologies 
we may not have the economic or technological resources to be successful in such efforts and we may not be able to identify and respond to technological improvements made by our competitors in a timely or cost effective fashion 
a significant technological breakthrough by others  including smaller competitors or new firms  could have a material adverse impact on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our dependence on international sales may adversely affect us 
sales for use by international customers including sales to prime contractors international customers represented approximately  and of our total net sales for the fiscal years ended july   and  respectively 
approximately of our backlog at july  consisted of orders for use by foreign customers 
direct and indirect sales to a north african country during the fiscal year ended july  were of total net sales 
we expect that international sales will continue to be a substantial portion of our total sales 
these sales expose us to certain risks  including barriers to trade  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates which may make our products less price competitive  political and economic instability  exposure to public health epidemics such as severe acute respiratory syndrome sars  availability of suitable export financing  tariff regulations  and other us and foreign regulations that may apply to the export of our products and the generally greater difficulties of doing business abroad 
we attempt to reduce the risk of doing business in foreign countries by seeking subcontracts with large systems suppliers  contracts denominated in us dollars  advance or milestone payments  credit insurance and irrevocable letters of credit in our favor 
however  we may not be able to reduce the economic risk of doing business in foreign countries  in all instances 
in such cases billed and unbilled receivables relating to international sales are subject to increased collectibility risk and may result in significant write offs  which could have a material adverse impact on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
foreign defense contracts generally contain provisions relating to termination at the convenience of the government 
in addition  certain of our products and systems may require licenses from us government agencies for export from the united states  and some of our products are not permitted to be exported 
we cannot be sure of our ability to gain any licenses that may be required to export our products  and failure to receive required licenses could materially reduce our ability to sell our products outside the united states 
reductions in telecommunications equipment and systems spending may negatively affect our revenues  profitability and the recoverability of our assets  including intangible assets 
from the second half of fiscal through fiscal  our revenues from commercial customers were negatively affected by the uncertain economic environment both in the overall market  and more specifically in the telecommunications and aviation sectors 
although we have seen signs of a strengthening economy  if this trend does not continue  some of our customers may reduce their budgets for spending on telecommunications equipment and systems 
as a consequence  our current customers and other prospective customers may postpone  reduce or even forego the purchase of our products and systems  which could adversely affect our revenues  profitability and the recoverability of our assets  including intangible assets  particularly in our telecommunications transmission and rf microwave amplifier segments  which are exposed to the telecommunications and aviation sectors 
our mobile data communications business is subject to risk 
although fiscal sales and earnings increased significantly over prior years  our mobile data communications business has a relatively limited operating history compared to our other business segments 
it is subject to all of the risks inherent in the operation of a new business enterprise 
in addition to the other risk factors described in this section  the risk factors applicable to our mobile data communications services business include the following although our us army contract for the logistics command s movement tracking system obligates us to provide satellite services and hardware  including mobile satellite transceivers and computers  through  as and when ordered by the us army and at the fixed prices and other terms set forth in this contract  the us army is not obligated to purchase any terminals or services under this contract and may terminate this contract 
sales under the us army contract could be subject to unpredictable funding and deployment decisions 
through july   we have received orders aggregating million under the mts contract  million of which relates to battlefield command and control applications 
certain components that we need have purchasing lead time of four months or longer  and the us army contract requires us to provide mobile terminals within days after we receive an order 
our success in commercial markets will depend on  among other things  our ability to access the best distribution channels  the development or licensing of applications which create value for the customer and our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel 
delays in delivering terminals could also adversely affect our ability to obtain and retain commercial customers 
in general  as we seek to grow our mobile data communications services business  we anticipate that we will need to maintain a substantial inventory in order to provide terminals to our customers on a timely basis 
if forecasted orders are not received  we might be left with large inventories of slow moving or unusable parts or terminals 
this could result in an adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we lease the satellite capacity necessary to operate our system from third party satellite networks 
we currently have a long term lease that expires on june  with a satellite network operator  mobile satellite ventures  for satellite coverage in north america  central america and the northern rim of south america 
we have leases with other vendors for satellite coverage in other parts of the world as required by the us army contract 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain sufficient satellite capacity or geographical coverage from any vendor to operate our mobile data communications services system on acceptable terms or on a timely basis 
there are several existing competitors in the mobile data communications market that have established systems with sizable customer bases and much greater financial resources than us 
the largest of these competitors is qualcomm  inc existing competitors  including terrestrial service providers  are also aggressively pricing their products and services and may continue to do so in the future 
competitors continue to offer new value added products and services  which we may be unable to match on a timely or cost effective basis 
increased competition may impact margins throughout the industry 
we anticipate that new competitors will enter the mobile data communications market in the future 
this could impact our entry into the commercial market in a significant way 
all satellite communications are subject to the risk that a satellite or ground station failure or a natural disaster may interrupt service 
in addition  during the first half of fiscal  we expect to complete our new state of the art network operations center located in our new germantown  maryland facility 
the existing network operations center will be relocated to our tempe  arizona facility and will be used to provide back up capability 
we may not be able to successfully complete this move and relocation 
interruptions in service could have a material adverse impact on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
at present  one of our satellite providers is operating without a full in orbit back up capability in the event of a failure of one of its two satellites in operation 
should we be obliged to restore service on another system in the event of a satellite failure  our costs would increase and could have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our backlog is subject to customer cancellation or modification 
we currently have a backlog of orders  mostly under contracts that the customer may modify or terminate 
we cannot assure you that our backlog will result in sales 
our dependence on component availability  subcontractor availability and performance and key suppliers may adversely affect us 
we do not generally maintain a substantial inventory of components and subsystems 
we obtain certain components and subsystems from a single source or a limited number of sources  but believe that most components and subsystems are available from alternative suppliers and subcontractors 
a significant interruption in the delivery of such items  however  could have a material adverse impact on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our fixed price contracts subject us to risk 
almost all of our products and services are sold under fixed price contracts 
this means that we bear the risk of unanticipated technological  manufacturing  supply or other problems  price increases or increases in the cost of performance 
adverse regulatory changes could impair our ability to sell products 
our products are incorporated into wireless communications systems that must comply with various government regulations  including those of the federal communications commission fcc 
regulatory changes  including changes in the allocation and availability of frequency spectrum  and in the military standards and specifications that define the current satellite networking environment  could materially harm our business by restricting development efforts by us and our customers  making our current products less attractive or obsolete  or increasing the opportunity for additional competition 
changes in  or our failure to comply with  applicable regulations could materially harm our business 
in addition  the increasing demand for wireless communications has exerted pressure on regulatory bodies worldwide to adopt new standards and reassign bandwidth for these products and services 
the reduced number of available frequencies for other products and services and the time delays inherent in the government approval process of new products and services have caused and may continue to cause our customers to cancel  postpone or reschedule their installation of communications systems including their satellite  over the horizon microwave  or terrestrial line of sight microwave communication systems 
this  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on our sales of products to our customers 
we face risks from the uncertainty of prevailing economic and political conditions 
current global political and economic conditions are uncertain 
as a result  it is difficult to estimate the level of expansion  if any  for the global or us economies generally or the markets in which we participate 
because our budgeting and forecasting process relies on estimates of growth in the markets we serve  the current economic environment renders estimates of future income and expenses even more difficult than usual to formulate 
the future direction of the domestic and global economies and political environment could have a material adverse impact on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
acquisitions and strategic investments may divert our resources and management attention  results may fall short of expectations 
we intend to continue pursuing selected acquisitions of and investments in businesses  technologies and product lines as a key component of our growth strategy 
any future acquisition or investment may result in the use of significant amounts of cash  potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  incurrence of debt and amortization expenses or in process research and development charges related to intangible assets 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including difficulties in the integration and assimilation of the operations  technologies  products and personnel of an acquired business  diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  increased expenses associated with the acquisition  and potential loss of key employees or customers of any acquired business 
we cannot assure you that our acquisitions will be successful and will not adversely affect our business  results of operations or financial condition 
the loss of key technical or management personnel could adversely affect our business 
our success depends on the continued contributions of key technical management personnel  including the key corporate and operating unit management at each of our subsidiaries 
many of our key personnel  particularly the key engineers of our subsidiaries  would be difficult to replace  and are not subject to employment or noncompetition agreements 
our growth and future success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified engineering  sales and marketing personnel 
competition for such personnel from other companies  academic institutions  government entities and other organizations is intense 
although we believe that we have been successful to date in recruiting and keeping key personnel  we may not be successful in attracting and retaining the personnel we will need to continue to grow and operate profitably 
also  the management skills that have been appropriate for us in the past may not continue to be appropriate if we continue to grow and diversify 
our markets are highly competitive 
the markets for our products are highly competitive 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully compete or that our competitors will not develop new technologies and products that are more commercially effective than our own 
we expect the us department of defense s increased use of commercial off the shelf products and components in military equipment will encourage new competitors to enter the market 
also  although the implementation of advanced telecommunications services is in its early stages in many developing countries  we believe competition may intensify as businesses and foreign governments realize the market potential of telecommunications services 
many of our competitors have financial  technical  marketing  sales and distribution resources greater than ours 
protection of our intellectual property is limited  we are subject to the risk of third party claims of infringement 
our businesses rely in large part upon our proprietary scientific and engineering know how and production techniques 
historically  patents have not been an important part of our protection of our intellectual property rights 
we rely upon the laws of unfair competition  restrictions in licensing agreements and confidentiality agreements to protect our intellectual property 
we limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information 
these efforts allow us to rely upon the knowledge and experience of our management and technical personnel to market our existing products and to develop new products 
the departure of any of our key management and technical personnel  the breach of their confidentiality and non disclosure obligations to us or the failure to achieve our intellectual property objectives may have a material adverse impact on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our ability to compete successfully and achieve future revenue growth will depend  in part  on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and operate without infringing upon the rights of others 
we may fail to do so 
in addition  the laws of certain countries in which our products are or may be sold may not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
we believe that we own or have licensed all intellectual property rights necessary for the operation of our businesses as currently contemplated 
if the technology we use is found to infringe on protected technology  we could be required to change our business practices  license the protected technology  and or pay damages or other compensation to the infringed party 
if we are unable to license protected technology used in our business or if we were required to change our business practices  we could be prohibited from making and selling our products or providing certain telecommunications services 
our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations and we may be subject to environmental liabilities 
we engage in manufacturing and are subject to a variety of local  state and federal governmental laws and regulations relating to the storage  discharge  handling  emission  generation  manufacture and disposal of toxic or other hazardous substances used to manufacture our products  particularly in the fabrication of fiberglass antennas by our comtech antenna systems  inc subsidiary 
the failure to comply with current or future environmental requirements could result in the imposition of substantial fines  suspension of production  alteration of our manufacturing processes or cessation of operations that could have a material adverse impact on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  the handling  treatment or disposal of hazardous substances by us or our predecessors may have resulted or could in the future result in contamination requiring investigation or remediation  or leading to other liabilities  any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
recently enacted and proposed changes in securities laws and regulations are increasing our costs 
the sarbanes oxley act of that became law in july requires changes in some of our corporate governance  public disclosure and compliance practices 
the act also requires the sec to promulgate new rules on a variety of subjects 
in addition  the nasdaq national market has revised its requirements for companies  such as us  that are listed on the nasdaq national market 
these developments are increasing our legal and financial compliance costs 
we expect these developments to make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance  and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage 
these developments could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors  particularly to serve on our audit committee  and qualified executive officers 
terrorist attacks and threats  and government responses thereto  and threats of war elsewhere may negatively impact all aspects of our operations  revenues  costs and stock price 
the terrorist attacks in the united states and against us interests overseas  the us government s response thereto  and threats of war may negatively affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
any escalation in these events or similar or future events may disrupt our operations or those of our customers and may affect the availability of materials needed to manufacture our products or the means to transport those materials to manufacturing facilities and finished products to customers 
in addition  these events have had and could continue to have an adverse impact on the us and world economy in general 
provisions in our corporate documents  stockholder rights plan  and delaware law could delay or prevent a change in control of comtech 
we have taken a number of actions that could have the effect of discouraging  delaying or preventing a merger or acquisition involving comtech that our stockholders may consider favorable 
for example  we have a classified board and the employment contract of our chief executive officer provides for a substantial payment in the event of a change of control of comtech 
we also adopted a stockholder rights plan that could cause substantial dilution to a stockholder  and substantially increase the cost paid by a stockholder  who attempts to acquire us on terms not approved by our board of directors 
these could prevent us from being acquired 
in addition  our certificate of incorporation grants the board of directors the authority to fix the rights  preferences and privileges of and issue up to  shares of preferred stock without stockholder action 
although we have no present intention to issue shares of preferred stock  such an issuance of any class or series of our preferred stock could have rights which would adversely affect the voting power of the common stock or which could delay  defer  or prevent a change in control of comtech 
in addition  we are subject to the provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law  an anti takeover law 
in general  this statute provides that except in certain limited circumstances a corporation shall not engage in any business combination including mergers  asset sales and other transactions resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder 
subject to certain exceptions  for purposes of section of the delaware general corporation law  an interested stockholder is a person who  together with affiliates  owns  or within three years did own  or more of the corporation s voting stock 
this provision could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of comtech 
our debt service obligations may adversely affect our cash flow 
the higher level of indebtedness resulting from the issuance of our convertible senior notes increases the risk that we may default on our debt obligations 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flow to pay the interest on our debt or that future working capital  borrowings or equity financing will be available to pay or refinance such debt 
the level of our indebtedness  among other things  could make it difficult for us to make payments on our debt  make it difficult for us to obtain any necessary financing in the future for working capital  acquisitions  capital expenditures  debt service requirements or other purposes  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we compete  and make us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business 
our stock price is volatile 
the stock market in general  and the stock prices of technology based companies in particular  have experienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of any specific public company 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and is likely to fluctuate significantly in the future as well 
factors that may have a significant impact on the market price of our stock include future announcements concerning us or our competitors  receipt or non receipt of substantial orders for products and services  results of technological innovations  new commercial products  changes in recommendations of securities analysts  government regulations  proprietary rights or product or patent litigation  changes in economic conditions generally  particularly in the telecommunications sector  changes in market conditions generally  particularly in the market for small cap stocks  and limited public float 
shortfalls in our sales or earnings in any given period relative to the levels expected by securities analysts could immediately  significantly and adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 
we have never declared or paid cash dividends 
we have never declared or paid a cash dividend and do not intend to declare any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in interest rates primarily from our investment of available cash balances 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
if the interest rate we receive on our investment of available cash balances were to change by  the effect would be immaterial 
our convertible senior notes bear a fixed rate of interest 
as such  our earnings and cash flows are not sensitive to changes in interest rates on our long term debt
