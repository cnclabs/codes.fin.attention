item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is intended to provide information relevant to an understanding of our financial condition  changes in our financial condition and our results of operations and cash flows and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this form k 
overview we are an oil and gas exploration company 
our basic business is to find oil and gas reserves through exploration activities  and sell the production from those reserves at a profit 
to be successful  we must  over time  be able to find oil and gas reserves and then sell our discovered production at a price that is sufficient to cover our finding costs  operating expenses  administrative costs and interest expense  plus offer us a return on our capital investment 
at first glance  the current economic climate in the domestic oil and gas industry appears to be very suitable for this business model 
product prices for both oil and gas are high by historical standards 
the domestic oil markets are primarily controlled by world wide supply and demand fundamentals 
recent improvements in the global economy  particularly in china and the us  have increased demand for oil and have eroded the cushion of production that has historically been available in tight oil markets 
these factors seem to support an average oil price for at least equal to  if not higher 
high oil prices and the ongoing decline in north american gas deliverability is expected to keep domestic gas prices high as well 
if the us continues to experience the recent apparent economic recovery  demand for natural gas in the industrial sector is likely to rise in the near term  keeping spot gas prices near current levels for the year 
industry experts predict that it will be several years before rising imports of liquefied natural gas are expected to largely offset the declining gas supply 
but as we probe deeper into the obvious benefits afforded by higher product prices  we find a major hurdle that our company  along with most other small to mid cap companies in this industry  must clear in order to be profitable for the long term  the hurdle being that quality domestic oil and gas reserves are becoming harder to find 
reserves to be produced from undiscovered reservoirs appear to be smaller  and the risks we must take to find these reservoirs are greater 
a recent report from the energy information administration indicates that on shore domestic finding costs are on the rise  and that the average reserves added per well are declining 
the risks involved in finding oil and gas reserves are high 
during the past two years  we have had limited drilling successes and have not found sufficient reserves to replace our production 
in order to avoid further liquidation of our existing reserves  we need to reverse this trend through successful drilling in and beyond 
key factors to consider the following summarizes the key factors that management considered in the review of our financial condition and operating performance for and the related outlook for out of the net exploratory wells drilled in  net wells were nonproductive 
this contributed to million of abandonment and impairment costs being charged to exploration expense in our statement of operations 
we currently plan to spend million in on exploration and development activities  of which more than relates to exploratory prospects 
these planned activities are in areas where we had limited success in and since past results are not necessarily indicative of future results  we cannot predict our drilling success in or beyond 
if we continue to have limited success in our exploratory drilling  our future results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
our proved oil and gas reserves declined from to due primarily to the fact that we replaced only of our production through extensions and discoveries of new reserves during the year 
we also revised our previous reserve estimates downward by approximately due primarily to performance based adjustments on certain wells 
if we do not find significant reserves through our exploration program  we could liquidate another of our reserves through production in excluding any additional production from wells currently in progress or to be drilled  we project that oil and gas production in will decline about as compared to absent a significant increase in product prices  lower production will cause our oil and gas sales and cash flow to be lower in than we produced more oil and gas in than in any other year in our history  and this achievement occurred at a time when average oil and gas prices were also favorable 
as a result  we reported record oil and gas sales and cash flows from operating activities in we used a significant portion of our cash flow from operating activities to reduce our bank indebtedness by 
this improved our long term debt to equity ratio from to at december  to 
to at december  and provided us with sufficient liquidity for at least  based on our current cash flow estimates 
summary of exploration results we began our transition from a development company to an exploration company in as we approached the end of the development phase of our acreage in the austin chalk trend where we had been active as a horizontal driller 
due to the high risk high reward nature of oil and gas exploration  we made this transition expecting to incur costs on prospects that were ultimately nonproductive  but also expecting to generate sufficient cash flow from the productive prospects to provide us with an acceptable rate of return on our entire investment  both nonproductive and productive 
following is a summary by area of our principal exploration efforts since and the results we have achieved to date 
cotton valley reef complex we began this program in with a d seismic shoot over a large portion of our existing acreage in the austin chalk trend and identified several structures that we believed could be productive 
since  we have drilled wells  of which were productive 
although we had a high success rate in this area  the economic success is largely attributable to one well  the lee fazzino unit at december   our net remaining reserves from this well are estimated at bcf  with a present value of proved reserves of million 
following is an economic summary of our direct investments pre tax in the cotton valley reef complex area from inception through december  inception through december  dollars in thousands investment land and exploration costs drilling costs net cash flow received from production net cash flow surplus remaining proved developed producing reserves bcfe we plan to spend million in the cotton valley reef complex area in primarily to drill two exploratory wells  one of which will test a shallower structure in the knowles formation 
in addition to the deep test to be drilled this year  we have identified two additional deep structures that may be suitable for future exploratory drilling after if the knowles test well is successful  it is likely that we will need to drill additional wells in order to determine the extent of the structure 
south louisiana since  a significant portion of our exploration effort has been directed toward the miocene trend in south louisiana 
our team of geologists and geophysicists has access to over  square miles of d seismic data in this area  and they are actively processing and evaluating this data in search of exploratory prospects with high reserve potential 
the miocene trend includes much of south louisiana which is one of the top gas producing regions in the country 
to date  we have drilled  or participated in drilling  gross net wells in this area  of which gross net were productive 
while we continue to believe that this area offers significant opportunities for a viable exploration program  we are disappointed with our results to date 
we have tried several strategies for improving our success using enhanced d seismic technology  but the results have been mixed and inconclusive 
some prospects that had specific seismic characteristics  such as amplitudes and avo  combined with closures and formations that are high to existing production  were successful in finding quality oil and gas reserves  and others with similar characteristics have been unsuccessful 
our current strategy is to give preference to prospects with larger structures and higher reserve potentials  such as the fleur prospect currently being completed and the andrea prospect  a deep prospect scheduled to be drilled in exploratory wells on deeper prospects will generally be more expensive to drill  and therefore may subject us to a higher risk of loss 
however  these prospects will also provide the potential for high impact discoveries 
following is an economic summary of our direct investments pre tax in south louisiana exploration efforts from inception through december  this summary excludes any investment in  or net cash flow from production attributable to  the acquisition or development of the romere pass unit 
inception through december  dollars in thousands investment land and exploration costs drilling costs less costs of unevaluated acreage and drilling in progress net cash flow received from production net cash flow deficit remaining proved reserves bcfe proved developed producing proved developed nonproducing almost of the unevaluated costs at december   as shown in the above table  are related to the fleur prospect where completion operations are currently underway on the sl in plaquemines parish 
we are currently setting a liner in the well bore and expect to perforate and flow test the well by the end of march 
if the test results are favorable  we will begin construction on the necessary production facilities  which could take up to four months  depending on permitting  weather and other construction related issues 
once sustained production is achieved  we will need several months of production history to be able to assess the well s ultimate reserve potential 
to date  our share of drilling and completion costs on the sl total approximately million 
we currently plan to spend million in south louisiana in to generate and lease new exploratory prospects and to drill existing exploratory prospects 
previous drilling results are not necessarily indicative of future results 
actual results may be better or worse than our track record in this area 
all of the planned expenditures are considered to be high risk 
black warrior basin in we began an exploration program in the southern portion of the black warrior basin in mississippi targeting the stones river knox trend  an ordovician age formation 
this program is on trend with the maben field where wells are currently producing from this formation 
since our initial purchase of  net acres in  we have been acquiring additional leases and processing and evaluating approximately miles of proprietary and  miles of acquired d seismic data to identify structural traps that could contain hydrocarbons 
we currently hold approximately  net acres covering the stones river knox trend 
from inception through december   we have spent million in this area to acquire acreage and to obtain and evaluate seismic data 
to date  we have identified several stones river structures that we plan to drill 
in  we expect to spend approximately million to drill two wells 
our first exploratory well in this area  the weyerhaeuser in webster county  is located about miles from the nearest producer in the maben field and will be drilled to a total depth of  feet 
drilling operations should be completed in the second quarter of if productive  additional development drilling of six to twelve wells could be possible on this structure 
we plan to drill a second exploratory well on one of the other identified structures later in in addition to the stones river formation  seismic data has revealed several structures in the shallower pennsylvanian sand section that could be productive 
these sands range in depths from  feet to  feet in the area and consists of several different styles of stratigraphic and structural traps similar in nature to those found in the permian basin of west texas 
only one well in the maben field is currently producing from the pennsylvanian formation 
other in addition to the above described programs  we have conducted exploration activities in other areas such as south texas  the sweetlake area in louisiana  and the bossier and glen rose plays in east texas 
in the aggregate  we have invested approximately million in these exploration programs 
through december   we have received net cash flow from production of approximately million 
remaining proved developed producing reserves at december  totaled bcfe

operating results the following discussion compares our results for the year ended december  to the two previous years 
all references to  and within this section refer to the respective annual periods 
oil and gas operating results we achieved the highest level of oil and gas sales in our company s history during this was a year in which both basic components of oil and gas sales production volumes and product prices were favorable 
production in on an mcfe basis was higher than and higher than while oil production has been trending down since due mainly to a lack of developmental drilling opportunities in the oil prone austin chalk trend area  our gas production has been trending up at a greater rate due primarily to higher production from the cotton valley reef complex and from steadily increasing gas production from louisiana 
approximately of and of louisiana gas production was derived from the romere pass unit that we acquired effective august the remainder of the louisiana gas increases was related primarily to production from exploratory drilling 
in  our realized gas price was higher than and higher than  while our realized oil price was higher than and higher than historically  the markets for oil and gas have been volatile  and they are likely to continue to be volatile 
we have very little control over the prices we receive for our production at the wellhead since most of our physical marketing arrangements are market sensitive 
however  we have  from time to time  entered into commodity derivative contracts to try to maximize the average realized price 
looking forward  in the absence of new production from our exploration program or from acquisitions of proved reserves  we currently estimate that our oil and gas production on an mcfe basis will be approximately lower in than oil production will continue to trend downward although at a slightly slower rate due to certain developmental drilling in new mexico and water fracs in the austin chalk trend 
gas production will begin to trend downward due primarily to depletion in the cotton valley reef complex area 
we plan to spend over million in to explore for new oil and gas production 
through these exploration efforts  we believe we can add sufficient volumes of new production to reduce or eliminate this decline 
if we do not offset this projected production decline with new production from exploration activities or acquisitions of proved properties  oil and gas sales and cash flow in may be significantly lower than as for prices  we cannot predict with accuracy future prices for oil and gas although currently we believe the fundamentals are in place for a continued strong market 
however  we have not designated our current commodity derivatives  and do not currently intend to designate future commodity derivatives  as cash flow hedges under sfas this means that  in future periods  our derivatives will be marked to market through our statement of operations as other income loss instead of through accumulated other comprehensive income on our balance sheet 
additionally  all realized gains or losses on these derivatives in future periods will be reported in other income instead of oil and gas sales 
this accounting treatment affects the timing and classification of income loss from derivatives  but it has no effect on cash flow from operating activities 
since we cannot predict future oil and gas prices  we cannot predict the effect that this accounting treatment will have on oil and gas sales or other income loss in future periods 
oil and gas production costs on an mcfe basis have been consistent from through however  since a portion of these costs  such as labor  supervision  insurance and administration  are relatively fixed in nature and do not reduce significantly as production volumes decline  we currently estimate that our production costs per mcfe produced will be between and higher in than depletion on an mcfe basis dropped from to due to unusually high depletion rates in caused by rapid depletion on certain marginally productive properties in the bossier sands  sweetlake and south texas areas 
the rate per mcfe increased only slightly in from however  we estimate that our depletion expense per mcfe produced could be between and higher in than due to a variety of factors  including the downward revision in previous reserve estimates during the fourth quarter of exploration costs since we follow the successful efforts method of accounting  our results of operations are adversely affected during any accounting period in which significant seismic costs  exploratory dry hole costs  and unproved acreage impairments are expensed 
in  we charged to expense million of exploration costs  as compared to million in and million in most of these costs were incurred in two of our principal exploration areas  the cotton valley reef complex and south louisiana 
in  we drilled completed net exploratory wells  of which were productive  resulting in a success rate 
none of the net exploratory wells drilled in was productive 
we plan to spend approximately million on exploration and development activities in primarily in the same core exploration areas as in since exploratory drilling involves a high degree of risk  it is likely that a significant portion of this will be charged to exploration costs in however  we cannot predict our success rates and  accordingly  cannot predict our exploration costs related to abandonment and impairment costs 
oil and gas reserves one of the key indicators by which we measure overall performance is our reserve replacement percentage 
since oil and gas reserves are a depleting resource  we must  over time  replace more than of our production with reserves from new sources in order to build shareholder value 
the sources by which we can replace reserves are i extensions and discoveries  and ii purchases of proved properties 
revisions to previous estimates resulting from changes in prices and production performance  whether positive or negative  are also considered in the determination of reserve replacements during any period 
over the past three years  we have replaced of our cumulative production  comprised of from extensions and discoveries  from purchases of proved properties and a negative from net downward revisions 
while this three year replacement rate is acceptable  we are not satisfied with the more recent two year trend 
we replaced only of our production and of our production through extensions and discoveries 
due primarily to our limited reserve replacement in  our proved reserves declined from to over time  if we reinvest our cash flow from operations into exploration activities and do not find sufficient oil and gas reserves to replace our production  we are essentially liquidating our asset base 
on a worst case scenario  if we do not replace any of our production through extensions and discoveries or acquisitions of proved properties  our estimated proved reserves at the end of would be approximately lower than  based on economic and operating conditions used in the determination of proved reserves at december  other at december   we have million of federal tax loss carryforwards that begin to expire in as long as we are profitable in future periods  it is likely that we will be able to utilize these carryforwards before they expire 
however  to the extent we incur any pre tax losses in future periods  we do not currently intend to record a deferred tax benefit 
instead  we will record a valuation allowance against the increase in deferred tax assets caused by such losses 
liquidity and capital resources overview our primary financial resource is our base of oil and gas reserves 
we pledge our producing oil and gas properties to secure a line of credit  called a credit facility  with a group of banks 
the banks establish a borrowing base by making an estimate of the collateral value of our oil and gas properties 
we borrow funds on the credit facility as needed to supplement our operating cash flow as a financing source for our capital expenditure program 
our capital expenditure program is dependent upon the level of product prices and the success of our exploration program in replacing our existing oil and gas reserves 
if product prices decrease  our operating cash flow may decrease and the banks may require additional collateral or reduce our borrowing base  thus reducing funds available to fund our capital expenditure program 
the effects of product prices on cash flow can be mitigated through the use of commodity derivatives 
if our exploration program does not replace our oil and gas reserves  we may also suffer a reduction in our operating cash flow and access to funds under the credit facility 
under extreme circumstances  product price reductions or exploration drilling failures could allow the banks to seek to foreclose on our oil and gas properties  thereby threatening our financial viability 
in this section  we will describe our current plans for capital spending  identify the capital resources available to finance our capital spending  and discuss certain factors that can affect our liquidity and capital resources 
capital expenditures we presently plan to spend approximately million on exploration and development activities during  as summarized by area in the following table 
total planned expenditures year ended december  percentage of total in thousands south louisiana cotton valley reef complex mississippi new mexico austin chalk trend other over of the planned expenditures relate to exploratory prospects 
exploratory prospects involve a higher degree of risk than developmental prospects 
to offset the higher risk  we generally strive to achieve a higher reserve potential and rate of return on investments in exploratory prospects 
you need to be aware that actual expenditures during may be substantially higher or lower than these estimates since our plans for exploration and development activities may change during the year 
we do not attempt to forecast our success rate on exploratory drilling 
accordingly  these current estimates do not include any costs we may incur to complete our successful exploratory wells and construct the required production facilities for these wells 
also  we are actively searching for other opportunities to increase our oil and gas reserves  including the evaluation of new prospects for exploratory and developmental drilling activities and potential acquisitions of proved oil and gas properties 
other factors  such as prevailing product prices and the availability of capital resources  could also increase or decrease the ultimate level of expenditures during as explained in operating results  we have had limited success in our exploration efforts during the past two years 
although previous drilling results are not necessarily indicative of future results  you should be aware that we are continuing to explore in substantially the same core areas as in and credit facility we rely heavily on the credit facility for both our short term liquidity and our long term financing needs 
the funds available to us at any time under this credit facility are limited to the amount of the borrowing base established by the banks 
as long as we have sufficient availability under the credit facility to meet our obligations as they come due  we have sufficient liquidity 
at the beginning of  we had an outstanding balance under the credit facility of million  and the borrowing base was million  leaving million of availability  after allowing for million of outstanding letters of credit 
during  we generated cash flow from operating activities of million  spent million on capital expenditures and other investments and repaid million on long term debt 
the outstanding balance on the credit facility at december  was million  leaving million available on the credit facility  after allowing for million of outstanding letters of credit 
subsequent to december   the borrowing base was reduced to million  and the maturity was extended to december  we used our high cash flow from operating activities in to reduce our indebtedness on the credit facility  thereby improving our debt to equity ratio and our overall liquidity 
at december   our long term debt to equity ratio was 
to  as compared to to at december  using the credit facility for both our short term liquidity and long term financing needs can cause unusual fluctuations in our reported working capital  depending on the timing of cash receipts and expenditures 
on a daily basis  we use most of our available cash to pay down our outstanding balance on the credit facility  which is classified as a non current liability since we currently have no required principal reductions 
as we use cash to pay a non current liability  our reported working capital decreases 
conversely  as we draw on the credit facility for funds to pay current liabilities such as payables for drilling and operating costs  our reported working capital increases 
also  volatility in oil and gas prices can cause significant fluctuations in reported working capital as we record changes in the fair value of derivatives from period to period 
for these reasons  the working capital covenant related to the credit facility requires us to i include the amount of funds available under the credit facility as a current asset  and ii exclude current assets and liabilities related to the fair value of derivatives  when computing the working capital ratio at any balance sheet date 
our reported working capital deficit at december  was million  as compared to a deficit of million at december  giving effect to the above adjustments and the subsequent reduction in our borrowing base  our working capital for loan compliance purposes is a positive million at december   as compared to a positive million at december  although working capital computed for loan compliance purposes differs from our working capital in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  the loan compliance working capital is useful in measuring our liquidity since it includes the resources available to us under the credit facility and negates the volatility in working capital caused by changes in fair value of derivatives 
the following table reconciles our gaap working capital to the working capital computed under the loan covenant at december  and in thousands working capital deficit per gaap add funds available under the credit facility exclude fair value of derivatives classified as current assets or current liabilities working capital per loan covenant as adjusted for reduction in borrowing base subsequent to december  the banks redetermine the borrowing base at least twice a year  in may and november  using the method described below 
if at any time  the borrowing base is less than the amount of outstanding indebtedness  we will be required to i pledge additional collateral  ii prepay the excess in not more than five equal monthly installments  or iii elect to convert the entire amount of outstanding indebtedness to a term obligation based on amortization formulas set forth in the loan agreement 
the loan agreement contains financial covenants that are computed quarterly and requires us to maintain minimum levels of working capital and cash flow 
we were in compliance with all of the financial and non financial covenants at december  alternative capital resources although our base of oil and gas reserves  as collateral for the credit facility  has historically been our primary capital resource  we have in the past  and could in the future  use alternative capital resources  such as asset sales  vendor financing arrangements  and or issuances of common stock through a secondary public offering or a rights offering 
we could also issue subordinated debt or preferred stock in a public or a private placement if we choose to raise capital through either of these markets 
while we believe we would be able to obtain funds through one or more of these alternatives  if needed  there can be no assurance that these capital resources would be available on terms acceptable to us 
off balance sheet arrangement in may  we invested approximately million as a limited partner in a partnership formed to purchase and operate two commercial office buildings in midland  texas  one of which is the location of our corporate headquarters 
our ownership interest in the partnership is before payout as defined in the partnership agreement and after payout 
we are not liable for any indebtedness of the partnership 
an entity controlled by clayton w 
williams serves as general partner of the partnership 
we do not manage or control the operations of the partnership or these buildings 
we currently utilize the equity method of accounting for our investment in this partnership 
we are currently evaluating what impact  if any  sfas interpretation no 
consolidation of variable interest entities  as revised in december fin r  will have on our financial statements 
we must adopt fin r in the first quarter of contractual obligations and contingent commitments the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  by payment due date

the following is a description of these known trends and uncertainties and  in the case of known trends  their affect on our financial condition or operating performance  and in the case of known uncertainties  the affect they would have if they were to occur 
focus on exploration activities for  more than of our planned capital expenditures relate to exploratory prospects 
exploration activities have greater risk than development activities 
development activities relate to increasing oil or natural gas production from an area that is know to be productive by drilling additional wells  working over and recompleting existing wells and other production enhancement techniques 
exploration activities involve the drilling of wells in areas where there is little or no known production 
exploration projects are identified through subjective analysis of geological and geophysical data  including the use of d seismic and other available technology 
by comparison  the identification of development prospects is significantly based upon existing production surrounding or adjacent to the proposed drilling site 
because our focus is on exploration activities  we have a greater risk of drilling dry holes or not finding oil and natural gas that can be produced economically 
the seismic data and other technology we use does not allow us to know with certainty prior to drilling a well whether oil or natural gas is present or can be produced economically 
in  gross net of the gross net wells drilled and completed in our core areas of south louisiana and cotton valley reef complex were dry holes 
we cannot assure you that any of our future exploration efforts will be successful  and if such activities are unsuccessful  it will have a significant adverse affect on our results of operations  cash flow and capital resources 
replacement of production with new reserves in general  the volume of production from an oil and gas property declines as reserves related to that property are depleted 
the decline rates depend upon reservoir characteristics 
historically  our oil and gas properties have had steep rates of decline and short estimated productive lives 
the average productive life of our reserves at december  is approximately years  based on production levels 
this is down from years at december   based on production levels 
our oil and gas reserves will decline as they are produced unless we are able to conduct successful exploration and development activities or acquire properties with proved reserves 
because we are currently focused on exploration activities  our ability to replace produced reserves is subject to a higher level of risk than it was when we were drilling development wells in the austin chalk trend 
during  we replaced of our net production through extensions and discoveries 
after adjusting our reserves for downward revisions of previous estimates  we realized a net replacement of only of our net production 
in  we replaced of our net production  consisting of from acquisitions of proved properties  from upward revisions of previous estimates  and from extensions and discoveries 
if we do not replace our production with new reserves over time  we will liquidate our reserves  which could affect our liquidity and capital resources 
we cannot assure you that we can successfully find and produce reserves economically or acquire additional proved reserves at acceptable costs in the future 
volatility of oil and gas prices historically  the markets for oil and gas have been volatile  and we believe that they are likely to continue to be volatile 
significant changes in oil and gas prices may result from relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas  market uncertainty and other factors that are beyond our control 
we cannot predict  with any degree of certainty  future oil and natural gas prices 
changes in oil and natural gas prices significantly affect our revenues  operating results  profitability and the value of our oil and gas reserves 
those prices also affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures  our ability to borrow money or raise additional capital and the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce economically 
the amount we can borrow under our credit facility is subject to periodic redeterminations based in part on current prices for oil and natural gas at the time of the redetermination 
changes in oil and gas prices impact both our estimated future net revenue and the estimated quantity of proved reserves 
price increases may permit additional quantities of reserves to be produced economically  and price decreases may render uneconomic the production of reserves previously classified as proved 
thus  we may experience material increases and decreases in reserve quantities solely as a result of price changes and not as a result of drilling or well performance 
we attempt to optimize the price we receive for our oil and gas production while maintaining a prudent hedging program to mitigate our exposure to declining product prices 
this strategy means that within the framework of a comprehensive hedging program  we sometimes terminate a hedge when we believe that market factors indicate there could be an increase in product prices that we would not realize with the hedge in place 
while we attempt to make informed market decisions on the termination of hedges  this strategy may sometimes expose us to downside risk that would not have existed otherwise 
reserve estimates estimates of our proved reserves and the estimated future net revenues from such reserves are based upon various assumptions including assumptions required by the sec relating to oil and gas prices  drilling and operating expenses  and other matters 
the process of estimating oil and gas reserves requires significant decisions and assumptions in the evaluation of available geological  geophysical  engineering and economic data for each reservoir 
the interpretation of such data is a subjective process dependent upon the quality of the data and the decision making and judgment of reservoir engineers 
estimates prepared by different engineers or by the same engineers at different times may vary substantially 
therefore  the estimates of our oil and gas reserves are inherently imprecise 
actual future production  oil and gas prices  revenues  taxes  development expenditures  operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves will most likely vary from the assumptions and estimates 
any significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and value of our oil and gas reserves  which in turn may adversely affect our cash flow  results of operations and the availability of capital resources 
in addition  we may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history  results of exploration and development  prevailing oil and gas prices and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
you should not assume that the present value of proved reserves is equal to the current fair market value of our estimated oil and gas reserves 
in accordance with the requirements of the sec  the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves are generally based on prices and costs as of the date of the estimate 
actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than those as of the date of the estimate 
the timing of both the production and the expenses with respect to the development and production of oil and gas properties will effect the timing of future net cash flows from proved reserves and their present value 
the estimated proved reserve information is based upon a reserve report prepared by independent engineers 
from time to time  estimates of our reserves are also made by the banks in establishing the borrowing base under the credit facility and by our engineers for use in developing business plans and making various decisions 
such estimates may vary significantly and have a material effect upon our business decisions and available capital resources 
concentration of proved reserves our proved developed reserves are concentrated in a limited number of fields and properties 
our top nine producing wells represent approximately of our estimated proved reserves at december  in addition  approximately of our estimated present value of proved reserves are located in three geographic areas  the austin chalk trend  the cotton valley reef complex area and in south louisiana 
such concentration of reserves makes us more susceptible to adverse developments with respect to any single well or area of operations and substantially dependent upon a few selected oil and gas properties 
an adverse event related to a single well or geographic area may have a significant adverse effect on our reserves  production  cash flow and general financial condition 
credit risks we sell our oil and natural gas production to various customers  serve as operator in the drilling  completion and operation of oil and gas wells  and enter into derivatives with various counterparties 
as appropriate  we obtain letters of credit to secure amounts due from our principal oil and gas purchasers and follow other procedures to monitor credit risk from joint owners and derivatives counterparties 
in  we increased the allowance for doubtful accounts related to amounts due from joint interest owners by approximately  we cannot assure you that we will not suffer any economic loss related to credit risks in the future 
uncertainties regarding liquidity and capital resources our cash flow forecasts indicate that the amount of funds available to us under the credit facility  when combined with our anticipated operating cash flow  will be sufficient to finance our capital expenditures and will provide us with adequate liquidity at least through the although we believe the assumptions and estimates made in our forecasts are reasonable  uncertainties exist which could cause the borrowing base to be less than expected  cash flow to be less than expected  or capital expenditures to be more than expected 
below is a discussion of uncertainties that are likely to have a material effect on our liquidity and capital resources if such uncertainties occur 
adverse changes in reserve estimates or commodity prices could reduce the borrowing base 
the banks establish the borrowing base at least twice annually by preparing a reserve report using price risk assumptions they believe are proper under the circumstances 
any adverse changes in estimated quantities of reserves  the pricing parameters being used  or the risk factors being applied  since the date of the last borrowing base determination  could lower the borrowing base under the credit facility 
adverse changes in reserve estimates or commodity prices could reduce our cash flow from operating activities 
we rely on estimates of reserves to forecast our cash flow from operating activities 
if the production from those reserves is delayed or is lower than expected  our cash flow from operating activities may be lower than we anticipated 
commodity prices also impact our cash flow from operating activities 
based on december  reserve estimates  we project that a drop in oil price and a 
drop in gas price would reduce our gross revenues in by approximately million and million  respectively 
adverse changes in the borrowing base may cause outstanding debt to equal or exceed the borrowing base 
in this event  we will not be able to borrow any additional funds  and we will be required to repay the excess or convert the debt to a term note 
without availability under the credit facility  we may be unable to meet our obligations as they mature 
delays in bringing successful wells on production may reduce our liquidity 
as a general rule  we experience a significant lag time between the initial cash outlay on a prospect and the inclusion of any value for such prospect in the borrowing base under the credit facility 
until a well is on production  the banks may assign only a minimal borrowing base value to the well  and cash flow from the well are not available to fund our operating expense 
delays in bringing wells on production may reduce the borrowing base significantly  depending on the amounts borrowed and the length of the delays 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates summary in this section  we will identify the critical accounting policies we follow in preparing our financial statements and disclosures 
many of these policies require us to make difficult  subjective and complex judgments in the course of making estimates of matters that are inherently imprecise 
we will explain the nature of these estimates  assumptions and judgments  and the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported in our financial statements under different conditions or using different assumptions 
the following table lists our critical accounting policies  the estimates and assumptions that can have a significant impact on the application of these accounting policies  and the financial statement accounts affected by these estimates and assumptions

significant estimates and assumptions oil and gas reserves reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner 
the accuracy of a reserve estimate depends on the quality of available geological and engineering data  the precision of the interpretation of that data  and judgment based on experience and training 
as a result  estimates of different petroleum engineers often vary  and the variances can be material 
annually  we engage an independent petroleum engineering firm to evaluate our oil and gas reserves 
as a part of this process  our internal reservoir engineer and the independent engineers exchange information and attempt to reconcile any material differences in estimates and assumptions 
we believe this reconciliation process improves the accuracy of the reserve estimates by reducing the likelihood of a material error in judgment 
the techniques used in estimating reserves usually depend on the nature and extent of available data  and the accuracy of the estimates vary accordingly 
as a general rule  the degree of accuracy of reserve estimates varies with the reserve classification and the related accumulation of available data  as shown in the following table 
type of reserves nature of available data degree of accuracy proved undeveloped data from offsetting wells  seismic data least accurate proved developed nonproducing logs  core samples  well tests  pressure data more accurate proved developed producing production history  pressure data over time most accurate assumptions as to future commodity prices and operating and capital costs also play a significant role in estimating oil and gas reserves and the estimated present value of the cash flows to be received from the future production of those reserves 
volumes of recoverable reserves are affected by the assumed prices and costs due to what is known as the economic limit that point in the future when the projected costs and expenses of producing recoverable reserves exceed the projected revenues from the reserves 
but more significantly  the estimated present value of future cash flows from the reserves is extremely sensitive to prices and costs  and may vary materially based on different assumptions 
sec financial accounting and reporting standards require that pricing parameters be tied to the price received for oil and natural gas on the effective date of the reserve report 
this requirement can result in significant changes from period to period given the volatile nature of oil and gas product prices  as illustrated in the following table 
proved reserves average price present value of proved reserves oil a mmbbls gas bcf oil a bbl gas mcf in millions as of december a includes natural gas liquids valuation of unproved properties placing a fair market value on unproved properties also known as prospects is very subjective since there is no quoted market for undeveloped exploratory prospects 
the negotiated price of any prospect between a willing seller and willing buyer depends on the specific facts regarding the prospect  including the location of the prospect in relation to known fields and reservoirs  available markets and transportation systems for oil and gas production in the vicinity  and other critical services  the nature and extent of geological and geophysical data on the prospect  the terms of the leases holding the acreage in the prospect  such as ownership interests  expiration terms  delay rental obligations  depth limitations  drilling and marketing restrictions  and similar terms  the prospect s risk adjusted potential for return on investment  giving effect to such factors as potential reserves to be discovered  drilling and completion costs  prevailing commodity prices  and other economic factors  and the results of drilling activity in close proximity to the prospect that could either enhance or condemn the prospect s chances of success 
valuation allowance for nol carryforwards in computing our provision for income taxes  we must assess the need for a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets  which consist primarily of net operating loss nol carryforwards 
for federal income tax purposes  these nol carryforwards  if unused  expire to years from the year of origination 
generally  we assess our ability to fully utilize these carryforwards by comparing expected future book income to expected future taxable income based on the assumption that we will produce our existing reserves  as scheduled for production in our reserve report  under current economic conditions 
if future book income does not exceed future taxable income by amounts sufficient to utilize nols before they expire  we must impair the resulting deferred tax asset 
these computations are inherently imprecise due to the extensive use of estimates and assumptions 
as a result  we may make additional impairments to allow for such uncertainties 
effects of estimates and assumptions on financial statements generally accepted accounting principles do not require  or even permit  the restatement of previously issued financial statements due to changes in estimates 
we are required to use our best judgment in making estimates and assumptions  taking into consideration the best and most current data available to us at the time of the estimate 
at each accounting period  we make a new estimate using new data  and continue the cycle 
you should be aware that estimates prepared at various times may be substantially different due to new or additional information 
while an estimate made at one point in time may differ from an estimate made at a later date  both may be proper due to the differences in available information or assumptions 
in this section  we will discuss the effects of different estimates on our financial statements 
provision for dd a we compute our provision for dd a on a unit of production method 
each quarter  we use the following formulas to compute the provision for dd a for each of our producing properties or appropriate groups of properties based on geographical and geological similarities dd a rate unamortized cost beginning of period reserves provision for dd a dd a rate current period production reserve estimates have a significant impact on the dd a rate 
if reserve estimates for a property or group of properties are revised downward in future periods  the dd a rate for that property or group of properties will increase as a result of the revision 
alternatively  if reserve estimates are revised upward  the dd a rate will decrease 
impairment of unproved properties each quarter  we review our unproved oil and gas properties to determine if there has been  in our judgment  an impairment in value of each prospect that we consider individually significant 
to the extent that the carrying cost of a prospect exceeds its estimated value  we make a provision for impairment of unproved properties  and record the provision as abandonments and impairments within exploration costs on our statement of operations 
if the value is revised upward in a future period  we do not reverse the prior provision  and we continue to carry the prospect at a net cost that is lower than its estimated value 
if the value is revised downward in a future period  an additional provision for impairment is made in that period 
impairment of proved properties each quarter  we assess our producing properties for impairment 
if we determine there has been an impairment in any of our producing properties or appropriate groups of properties based on geographical and geological similarities  we will estimate the value of each affected property 
in accordance with applicable accounting standards  the value for this purpose is a fair value instead of a standardized reserve value as prescribed by the sec 
we attempt to value each property using reserve classifications and pricing parameters similar to what a willing seller and willing buyer might use 
these parameters may include escalations of prices instead of constant pricing  and they may also include the risk adjusted value of reserves that do not qualify as proved reserves 
to the extent that the carrying cost for the affected property exceeds its estimated value  we make a provision for impairment of proved properties 
if the value is revised upward in a future period  we do not reverse the prior provision  and we continue to carry the property at a net cost that is lower than its estimated value 
if the value is revised downward in a future period  an additional provision for impairment is made in that period 
accordingly  the carrying costs of producing properties on our balance sheet will vary from and often will be less than the present value of proved reserves for these properties 
judgment regarding status of in progress wells on a quarterly basis  we review the status of each in progress well to determine the proper accounting treatment under the successful efforts method of accounting 
cumulative costs on in progress wells remain capitalized until their productive status becomes known 
if an in progress exploratory well is found to be unsuccessful often referred to as a dry hole prior to the issuance of our financial statements  we write off all costs incurred through the balance sheet date to abandonments and impairments expense  a component of exploration costs 
costs incurred on that dry hole after the balance sheet date are charged to exploration costs in the period incurred 
occasionally  we are unable to make a final determination about the productive status of a well prior to issuance of our financial statements 
in these cases  we leave the well classified as in progress until we have had sufficient time to conduct additional completion or testing operations and to evaluate the pertinent g g and engineering data obtained 
at the time when we are able to make a final determination of a well s productive status  the well is removed from the in progress status and the proper accounting treatment is recorded 
valuation allowance for nol carryforwards each quarter  we assess our ability to utilize nol carryforwards 
an increase in the valuation allowance from one period to the next will result in a decrease in our net deferred tax assets and a decrease in earnings 
similarly  a decrease in the valuation allowance will result in an increase in our net deferred tax assets and an increase in earnings 
this process requires estimates and assumptions which are complex and may vary materially from our actual ability to utilize nol carryforwards in the future 
also  the current tax laws in this area are complicated due to the impact of alternative minimum tax on the utilization of nol carryforwards 
as a mitigating factor  as long as we are actively drilling for new production  we have some tax planning strategies available to us  such as elective capitalization of intangible drilling costs  to help us utilize these nol carryforwards before they expire 
recent accounting pronouncements in may  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity sfas 
this statement establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity and requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability or an asset in certain circumstances 
sfas is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  for financial instruments entered into or modified after may  our adoption of sfas did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in january  the fasb issued financial interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 
fin 
in december  the fasb revised certain aspects of fin fin r 
fin r is an interpretation of accounting research bulletin  consolidated financial statements  and addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities 
the primary objective of fin r is to provide guidance on the identification of  and financial reporting for  entities over which control is achieved through means other than voting rights  such entities are known as variable interest entities 
fin r requires an enterprise to consolidate a variable interest entity if that enterprise has a variable interest that will absorb a majority of the entity s expected losses if they occur  receive a majority of the entity s expected residual return if they occur  or both 
an enterprise shall consider the rights and obligations conveyed by its variable interests in making this determination 
we are currently evaluating what impact  if any  fin r will have on our financial statements 
we must adopt fin r in the first quarter of in its recent review of registrants filings  the staff of the securities and exchange commission sec has questioned the applicability of sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas to lease agreements and drilling rights commonly utilized in the oil and gas industry 
if applicable  sfas could require oil and gas companies to separately report on their balance sheets the costs of proved and unproved leasehold and mineral interests acquired after june   including related accumulated depletion  as intangible assets and provide related intangible asset disclosures 
oil and gas companies have generally included leasehold costs in the property and equipment caption on the balance sheet since the value of the proved leases is inseparable from the value of the related oil and gas reserves  and since the costs of unproved leasehold and mineral interests are regularly evaluated for impairment based on lease terms and drilling activity 
the emerging issues task force has recently added this issue to its agenda 
if sfas is determined to apply to oil and gas companies  we may be required to make certain reclassifications within property and equipment on the balance sheet  and additional disclosures may be required 
the reclassification of these amounts would not affect the method in which such costs are amortized or the manner in which we assesses impairment of capitalized costs 
as a result  net income would not be affected by the reclassification 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk s our business is impacted by fluctuations in commodity prices and interest rates 
the following discussion is intended to identify the nature of these market risks  describe our strategy for managing such risks  and to quantify the potential affect of market volatility on our financial condition and results of operations 
oil and gas prices our financial condition  results of operations  and capital resources are highly dependent upon the prevailing market prices of  and demand for  oil and natural gas 
these commodity prices are subject to wide fluctuations and market uncertainties due to a variety of factors that are beyond our control 
these factors include the level of global demand for petroleum products  foreign supply of oil and gas  the establishment of and compliance with production quotas by oil exporting countries  weather conditions  the price and availability of alternative fuels  and overall economic conditions  both foreign and domestic 
we cannot predict future oil and gas prices with any degree of certainty 
sustained weakness in oil and gas prices may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations  and may also reduce the amount of net oil and gas reserves that we can produce economically 
any reduction in reserves  including reductions due to price fluctuations  can reduce the borrowing base under the credit facility and adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to obtain capital for our exploration and development activities 
similarly  any improvements in oil and gas prices can have a favorable impact on our financial condition  results of operations and capital resources 
based on december  reserve estimates  we project that a drop in the price per bbl of oil and a 
drop in the price per mcf of gas would reduce our gross revenues for the year ending december  by million 
from time to time  we utilize commodity derivatives  consisting primarily of swaps  to attempt to optimize the price received for our oil and natural gas production 
when using swaps to hedge oil and natural gas production  we receive a fixed price for the respective commodity and pay a floating market price as defined in each contract generally nymex futures prices  resulting in a net amount due to or from the counterparty 
in the past we have also used collars which contain a fixed floor price put and ceiling price call 
if the market price for the respective commodity exceeds the call strike price or falls below the put strike price  then we receive the fixed price and pay the market price 
if the market price is between the call and the put strike prices  then no payments are due from either party 
the commodity derivatives we use differ from futures contracts in that there is not a contractual obligation that requires or permits the future physical delivery of the hedged products 
we do not enter into commodity derivatives for trading purposes 
in addition to commodity derivatives  we may  from time to time  sell a portion of our gas production under short term contracts at fixed prices 
we attempt to optimize the price we receive for our oil and gas production while maintaining a prudent hedging program to mitigate our exposure to declining product prices 
this strategy means that within the framework of a comprehensive hedging program  we sometimes terminate a hedge when we believe that market factors indicate that there could be an increase in product prices that we would not realize with the hedge in place 
while we attempt to make informed market decisions on the termination of hedges  this strategy may sometimes expose us to downside risk that would not have existed otherwise 
the following summarizes information concerning the company s net positions in open commodity derivatives applicable to periods subsequent to december oil swaps bbls average price production period st quarter nd quarter rd quarter th quarter gas collars mmbtu a floor ceiling production period st quarter nd quarter rd quarter th quarter a one mmbtu equals one mcf at a btu factor of  we use a sensitivity analysis technique to evaluate the hypothetical effect that changes in the market value of oil and gas may have on the fair value of our commodity derivatives 
the fair values of swaps react differently to changes in oil and gas prices than the fair values of collars 
a increase in the price per barrel of oil would result in an additional liability related to our position in oil swaps of  with regard to our position in gas collars  a 
per mmbtu increase in gas prices would result in a decrease in fair value of approximately million  while a 
per mmbtu decrease in gas prices would result in an increase in fair value of approximately million 
interest rates all of our outstanding bank indebtedness at december  is subject to market rates of interest as determined from time to time by the banks pursuant to the credit facility 
we may designate borrowings under the credit facility as either base rate loans or eurodollar loans 
base rate loans bear interest at a fluctuating rate that is linked to the discount rates established by the federal reserve board 
eurodollar loans bear interest at a fluctuating rate that is linked to libor 
any increases in these interest rates can have an adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flow 
we do not have any interest rate derivatives in place at the present time
