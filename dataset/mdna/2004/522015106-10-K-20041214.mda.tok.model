volatility of stock price over learning tree s year history  the price of its common stock has fluctuated significantly and may continue to do so in the future 
learning tree believes that some of the reasons for past fluctuations in the price of its stock have included announcements of developments related to learning tree s business  announcements concerning new products or enhancements by learning tree or its competitors  developments in relationships with its customers  market perceptions of new means of delivering training  such as cd roms or the internet  variations in revenues  gross margins  earnings or other financial results from investors expectations  fluctuations in results of operations and general conditions in the economy  the market  and the markets served by learning tree s customers  and delays in introducing new technologies by both learning tree s customers and technology vendors 
in addition  prices in the stock market  particularly for technology related stocks  have been volatile in recent years 
in some cases  the fluctuations have been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies 
sales of the common stock by officers  directors and employees  especially learning tree s founders  could also adversely and unpredictably affect the price of the common stock 
additionally  the price could be affected even by the potential for sales by these persons

please do not put undue reliance on these forward looking statements  since they are based on key assumptions about future risks and uncertainties 
although learning tree believes that its assumptions are reasonable  inevitably some will prove to be incorrect 
as a result  learning tree s actual future results can be expected to differ from those in the discussion that follows  and those differences may be material 
learning tree is not undertaking any obligation to update forward looking statements 
in order to help the reader assess the major risks in learning tree s business  learning tree has identified many  but not all  of these risks in exhibit  risk factors exhibit 
please read that exhibit carefully 
some of the factors discussed in exhibit that could affect learning tree include risks associated with the timely development  introduction  and customer acceptance of learning tree s courses  competition  international operations  including currency fluctuations  changing economic and market conditions  technology development and new technology introduction  efficient delivery and scheduling of learning tree s courses  adverse weather conditions  strikes  acts of war or terrorism and other external events  and attracting and retaining qualified personnel 
overview nature of the business 
learning tree is a leading worldwide vendor independent provider of training to managers and information technology it professionals working in business and government organizations 
since its founding in  learning tree has provided high quality training to over  it professionals and managers 
in fiscal  learning tree provided training to over  course participants 
approximately two thirds of learning tree participants come from fortune level companies  their international equivalents and government organizations  and approximately one third come from small and medium size companies 
learning tree offers a broad  proprietary library of intensive instructor led courses from two to five days in length  comprising different course titles representing over  hours of training at october  learning tree courses focus on web development  operating systems  programming languages  databases  computer networks  computer and network security  object oriented technology  project management  leadership and professional development  and other key business skills 
during fiscal  learning tree expanded its management course offerings to titles in order to meet demands for these courses from both technical and non technical managers 
learning tree uses a well defined  systematic approach in developing and updating its course library to provide training that is immediately relevant to course participants working in a broad range of applications and industries 
learning tree s proprietary course development process also allows it to customize its courses for delivery at its customers sites 
learning tree designs its own vendor independent it courses to provide participants an unbiased perspective of software and hardware products and the ability to compare and integrate multiple platforms and technologies from various vendors in a single course 
learning tree management courses  while addressing core concepts and theory  focus heavily on providing skills  tools  and techniques that participants can apply immediately upon returning to their jobs 

table of contents learning tree courses are highly interactive 
they are translated into french  swedish and japanese 
based on their sophistication and quality  all of learning tree s courses are recommended for one to two semester hours of college credit by the american council on education 
in addition  learning tree is on the national association of state boards of accountancy national registry of cpe sponsors and is a registered education provider of the project management institute pmi 
the actual number of course titles that learning tree will execute  and their delivery dates  are subject to the rate of new technological developments and perceived customer demand 
in general  titles are retired when the profits they generate are not sufficient to justify the ongoing cost of marketing them and maintaining their content 
thus  learning tree may or may not develop more titles than it retires in any period 
course development costs may increase in the future if learning tree expands its course library 
learning tree had instructors as of october   each of whom was a practicing professional combining expert knowledge with extensive practical experience 
on average  each expert instructor teaches approximately ten learning tree course events per year on an as needed basis 
during the rest of the year  learning tree instructors apply the it and management skills they teach as either full time employees for other companies or as independent consultants 
learning tree offers its proprietary courses through local operations in the united states  united kingdom  france  canada  sweden and japan  and generates approximately half of its revenue internationally 
each learning tree operating subsidiary is staffed by local nationals responsible for the sale and delivery of learning tree courses in that country 
learning tree s infrastructure and logistical capabilities allow it to coordinate  plan and deliver its courses at learning tree s education centers  hotel and conference facilities and customer sites worldwide 
during fiscal  learning tree presented courses in countries 
learning tree has structured its business so that the majority of its course costs are variable and depend primarily upon the number of course events conducted 
learning tree schedules its course events throughout the year based on its assessment of demand 
since learning tree s instructors typically work full time or as consultants in business and industry  or in the case of management instructors as industry consultants and facilitators  and teach learning tree course events as needed  learning tree s instructor related costs are largely variable 
however  learning tree s expenses associated with its own education centers and course equipment are largely fixed 
learning tree adjusts its expenditures for sales and marketing depending on its strategic objectives  which generally include an assessment of learning tree s expectations for influencing future customer demand  market conditions and other factors 
however  if learning tree s expectations regarding the results of its marketing efforts prove to be wrong  any significant revenue shortfall would have a material adverse effect on learning tree s results of operations 
recent trends 
as it has for years  learning tree continues to focus on enhancing quality levels in its core strengths its expert instructors  proprietary content library  state of the art classrooms and worldwide course delivery systems 
learning tree believes that quality and customer satisfaction remain the underlying driving force for its long term success 
during fiscal  learning tree s course participants rated the company s instructors and courses at the highest level in learning tree s year history 
learning tree s customers have continued to respond positively to the company s recent increase in the breadth and depth of learning tree s management course offerings 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  learning tree offered titles in its management curriculum representing of learning tree s entire course library  compared to titles  which represented in the fourth quarter of fiscal learning tree intends to meet the demand for these courses by continuing to develop additional management course titles  and by increasing the marketing for learning tree s management course program 
learning tree s business continues to be influenced by world events  by the economy  and by corporate spending trends for it  among other factors 
learning tree believes that the best way to counteract adverse 
table of contents market trends is to use a strong  focused  integrated marketing and sales strategy that clearly and visibly helps learning tree s customers identify specific applications of training services to improve their business performance 
accordingly  learning tree continues to assess alternative approaches to sales and marketing with the objective of improving its performance under current market conditions 
however  there is no guarantee that these approaches will be successful 
see exhibit  risk factors 
beginning with the second quarter of fiscal  learning tree adopted a or week fiscal year  changing its year end and quarter end dates to the friday nearest the end of the calendar quarter 
accordingly  learning tree s fiscal year ended on october  learning tree made this change in order to better align its external financial reporting with the way learning tree operates its business 
learning tree s financial results in the fourth quarter of fiscal were significantly impacted by charges to general and administrative expenses totaling approximately million for actual and potential costs through march related to the subleasing of learning tree facilities in the united kingdom 
see results of operations general and administrative expenses for further discussion 
results of operations the following table summarizes learning tree s consolidated statements of operations for the periods indicated expressed as percentages of revenues fiscal year ended september  september  october  revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses course development sales and marketing general and administrative total operating expenses income loss from operations other income expense  net income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income fiscal compared with fiscal in fiscal  learning tree s revenues were million compared to million in fiscal learning tree reported a loss from operations of million in fiscal compared to income from operations of million in the prior year 
net income for fiscal was  compared to million in fiscal learning tree s fiscal financial results include a charge of approximately million in the fourth quarter related to subleasing its united kingdom facilities see general and administrative expenses for further discussion 
excluding this charge  during fiscal  learning tree s income from operations was approximately  and net income was approximately million calculated as net income as reported of million plus million charge less related tax benefits of million 
revenues 
learning tree s fiscal revenues primarily reflect the net effect of increased average revenue per attendee due to the effect of changes in exchange rates  offset by a decline in the number of course 
table of contents participants compared to fiscal during fiscal  learning tree trained a total of  effective course participants  a decrease of from the prior year s  effective course participants 
for fiscal  average revenue per attendee was higher compared to fiscal however  excluding a effect from changes in foreign exchange rates  learning tree s average revenue per attendee declined in fiscal compared to the prior year 
approximately half of learning tree s business is conducted in currencies other than us dollars 
accordingly  exchange rate fluctuations impact both learning tree s reported revenues and expenses when translated into dollars 
see exhibit  risk factors 
excluding the effect of exchange rates  the decrease in average revenue per attendee primarily reflects the effect of a change in course mix to a greater proportion of courses conducted at customer sites and a lower proportion conducted at learning tree education centers 
courses held at customer sites generally have lower revenues per attendee compared to those conducted at learning tree education centers 
cost of revenues 
learning tree s cost of revenues primarily includes the costs of course instructors and their travel and living expenses  course materials and equipment  freight  classroom facilities and refreshments 
learning tree s cost of revenues for fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal this increase primarily reflects the net effect of changes in foreign exchange rates  partially offset by the effect of a decrease in the number of course events and the effects of learning tree s cost reduction and control measures 
during fiscal  learning tree presented  effective course events compared to  effective course events in fiscal in fiscal  learning tree s cost of revenues increased to of revenues compared to in fiscal changes in foreign exchange rates did not materially affect learning tree s gross profit percentage since exchange rate changes increased learning tree s cost of revenues by approximately the same percentage as they increased learning tree s revenues 
in fiscal  excluding the effect of exchange rates  the increase in cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues reflects a decrease in average revenue per event  partially offset by the effect of a decrease in average cost per event compared to fiscal the decrease in average revenue per event  excluding the effect of exchange rates  primarily reflects the change in mix to a greater proportion of courses conducted at customer sites 
courses held at customer sites generally have lower revenues per event compared to those conducted at learning tree education centers 
the improvement in average cost per event  excluding the effect of exchange rates  primarily reflects the results of learning tree s cost reduction and control measures  including reductions in instructor related costs and decreased staffing levels 
these decreases in cost per event were partially offset by the effect of increased allocated fixed costs per event  stemming from reduced utilization of learning tree s education centers and course equipment  as well as other fixed costs which were spread over fewer events 
course development expenses 
learning tree maintains a disciplined process to develop new courses and update its existing courses 
the costs incurred in that process  principally for internal product development staff and for subject matter experts  are expensed when incurred  and are included in course development expenses 
in fiscal  course development expenses also included all costs of learning tree s e learning research and development activities  which were terminated in the second quarter of that year because learning tree was unable to find what it believed could be a profitable and sustainable e learning business model 
in fiscal and fiscal  course development expenses were of revenues 
expenditures on course development increased slightly to million in fiscal from million the year before 
this increase primarily reflects increased course development activities and the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates  partially offset by the termination of all e learning research and development activities in the second quarter of fiscal during fiscal  learning tree released additional course titles on technical topics that included wi fi networking  windows server  integrating microsoft access with sql server  oracle database g  and 
table of contents systems management server  as well as additional course titles on management topics that included leading virtual and remote teams  preparing for the project management professional pmp exam  performance management  time management  presentation skills  negotiation skills  project leadership  project quality management  microsoft project server for the enterprise  and a guide to information technology 
at the end of fiscal  learning tree offered different course titles  comprising over  hours of training  compared to titles a year earlier 
the decrease in the number of titles in fiscal reflects the net effect of introducing new titles and retiring titles 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses include salaries  commissions and travel related costs for sales and marketing personnel  the costs of designing  producing and distributing direct mail marketing and media advertisements and the costs of information systems to support these activities 
for fiscal  sales and marketing expenses were of revenues compared to in fiscal the increase in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues primarily reflects an increase in sales and marketing expenditures 
the increase in expenditures is primarily due to an increase in the number of regular catalogs mailed compared to the prior year  as well as learning tree s new management curriculum catalog which was introduced during the second quarter of fiscal in addition  the increase in sales and marketing expenses reflects the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates 
these increases were partially offset by the effect of lower expenditures for marketing activities other than major mailings  lower sales and marketing staffing levels and lower sales commissions 
general and administrative expenses 
as a percentage of revenue  general and administrative expenses were in fiscal compared to in fiscal general and administrative expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase primarily reflects the charge of approximately million described below related to subleasing portions of learning tree s united kingdom education center and administrative office facilities and the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates 
these increases were partially offset by the effects of various cost savings including reduced staffing levels and lower depreciation expense 
the million charge related to subleasing portions of learning tree facilities in the united kingdom was comprised of three components 
two of the components relate to a year lease that was executed in fiscal for a building in london to house learning tree s united kingdom education center 
this building had sufficient space for learning tree s immediate classroom needs  plus three floors for potential future classroom expansion that learning tree has been subletting to two subtenants 
the first of these subleases has expired and the other subtenant recently notified learning tree that it will vacate when its sublease expires on march  learning tree is actively seeking subtenants for these floors  as a whole or in parts  but has yet to sublease this space 
the first component of the charge arises from learning tree s estimate that a sublease with a new tenant for the currently vacant floor in its united kingdom education center is unlikely to be concluded much before march  accordingly  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  learning tree recorded a charge of  which reflects its rent expense for the vacant floor from july  through march  however  there can be no assurance of when learning tree will complete a sublease of the currently vacant floor  or when it will find tenants for the other two floors that will become vacant on march  to the extent that any of these floors are vacant after march   learning tree s general and administrative expenses will include a further charge of approximately  per quarter for each vacant floor 
accordingly  learning tree will make further provisions each quarter  as appropriate 
the second component of the charge arises because learning tree anticipates that in order to rent these floors in its united kingdom education center  it may need to make certain concessions  such as a period of free rent 
such concessions could result in a net sublease rental rate that is somewhat less than the rental rate that 
table of contents learning tree pays on its lease 
therefore  learning tree s charges in the fourth quarter include an additional  for the net present value of the estimated difference between the net sublease rental rates that learning tree anticipates for these three floors and its costs over an expected year sublease period 
however  the actual vacancy period s  the actual sublease rental rate s  and the actual duration of the sublease s will be different from the estimates that learning tree has used in computing its estimate for this charge 
if learning tree s estimates are wrong  and such space is sublet sooner later  or at more less favorable rates  learning tree will have to record either additional charges or a reversal of previously recorded charges 
the third component of this charge is related to a portion of learning tree s united kingdom administrative office space that it subleased for the first time  and which will result in a reduction of learning tree s ongoing general and administrative expenses by an average over the sublease period of approximately  per quarter  beginning with learning tree s first quarter of fiscal however  learning tree subleased this space at a total rental rate that is below its costs 
therefore  learning tree recorded a charge of approximately  to reflect the net present value of this shortfall over the six and a half year period of the sublease  which ends co terminus with learning tree s prime lease on this office 
other income expense 
other income expense is primarily comprised of interest income and foreign currency transaction gains and losses 
in fiscal  other income expense decreased to income of million from million in fiscal primarily because of lower interest income 
interest income decreased  compared to fiscal due to the effect of lower interest rates together with a decline in the amount of learning tree s interest bearing investments because of expenditures for repurchases of its common stock 
the decrease in interest income was partially offset by a  gain from the liquidation of a million minority interest equity investment in collegis  inc formerly eduprise 
com that learning tree had purchased in january learning tree recorded foreign exchange gains of  in fiscal compared to foreign exchange gains of  in fiscal these gains arose from cash balances  receivables and payables denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of learning tree s foreign subsidiaries 
income taxes 
in fiscal  learning tree s income tax provision decreased to  from million in fiscal this decrease reflects the lower taxable income and a lower effective tax rate consistent with learning tree s lower profit 
in addition  the change in learning tree s tax provision reflects changes in deferred taxes in fiscal learning tree operates as a holding company with operating subsidiaries in several countries 
each subsidiary is taxed based on the laws of the jurisdiction in which it operates 
since taxes are incurred at the subsidiary level  and tax rates vary from country to country and one subsidiary s tax losses cannot offset the taxable income of subsidiaries in other tax jurisdictions  learning tree s consolidated effective tax rate may vary 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
geographic segments 
learning tree has education centers in six countries around the world  and has historically derived approximately half of its revenues from outside the united states 
the change in revenues in fiscal primarily reflects the net effect of changes in exchange rates  offset by a decline in the number of course participants in all learning tree locations compared to fiscal learning tree s operating subsidiaries in the united kingdom  france  sweden  canada and asia  reported a decline in revenues on a local currency basis 
however  due to changes in exchange rates in fiscal compared to fiscal  those locations reported an increase in revenues compared to fiscal when their local currency revenues were translated into us dollars 
the united states recorded revenues of million in fiscal compared to revenues of million in fiscal revenues from europe were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal canada recorded revenues of million in fiscal compared to revenues of million in fiscal and asia recorded revenues of million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents although learning tree s consolidated financial statements are stated in us dollars  several of learning tree s subsidiaries have functional currencies other than the us dollar 
gains and losses arising from the translation of the balance sheets of learning tree s subsidiaries from the functional currencies to us dollars are reported as an adjustment to stockholders equity 
fluctuations in exchange rates may also have an effect on learning tree s results of operations 
since both revenues and expenses are generally denominated in the subsidiary s local currency  changes in exchange rates that have an adverse effect on learning tree s foreign revenues are partially offset by a favorable effect on learning tree s foreign expenses 
the impact of future exchange rates on learning tree s results of operations cannot be accurately predicted 
to date  learning tree has not sought to hedge the risks associated with fluctuations in exchange rates and therefore continues to be subject to such risks 
in the future  learning tree may undertake such transactions 
there can be no assurance that any hedging techniques implemented by learning tree would be successful in eliminating or reducing the effects of currency fluctuations 
see exhibit  risk factors 
fiscal compared with fiscal in fiscal  learning tree s revenues decreased by to million from million in fiscal income from operations for fiscal was million versus million in fiscal net income for fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal revenues 
the decrease in revenues in fiscal compared to fiscal was due to a decline in the number of course participants 
during fiscal  learning tree trained a total of  effective course participants  a decrease of from the prior year s  participants 
learning tree believes that the sluggishness in the it industry resulted in the continued year over year decline in spending on it training 
for fiscal  revenues reflected a increase in average revenue per attendee 
approximately of the improvement was due to changes in foreign exchange rates 
the remaining improvement was primarily due to an increase in the proportion of course participants using training vouchers compared to those using training passports 
training vouchers are discounted less from list prices than training passports 
cost of revenues 
the cost of revenues for fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal this decrease primarily reflected a decrease in the number of course events during fiscal during fiscal  learning tree presented  effective course events compared to  events in fiscal the decrease in the cost of revenues also reflected the effect of learning tree s cost reduction and control measures 
these savings were partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange rate changes 
the gross margin percentage was not significantly affected by the changes in exchange rates since such changes also increased fiscal revenues by a similar percentage 
in fiscal  the cost of revenues increased to of revenues compared to in fiscal in fiscal  excluding the impact of exchange rates  the cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues reflected a decrease in average revenue per event and a increase in the average cost per event compared to fiscal the decrease in average revenue per event reflected a lower average number of attendees per event  partially offset by the increase in average revenue per attendee discussed above 
learning tree believes that the decrease in the average number of attendees per event primarily reflected the economic conditions in the it industry  which lowered learning tree s overall attendance rate 
the increase in the average cost per event primarily reflected the impact of the reduced utilization of learning tree s education centers  course equipment and other fixed costs which were spread over fewer events  partially offset by learning tree s cost reduction and control measures  including the adjustment of staffing  the continued negotiation of supplier costs  the decrease of software costs and less course equipment depreciation 
course development expenses

for fiscal  sales and marketing expenses were of revenues compared to in fiscal the improvement resulted from absolute reductions in sales and marketing expenditures  which more than offset the effect of the decline in revenues 
during fiscal  sales and marketing expenses decreased by to million from million in fiscal the reduction in sales and marketing expenses primarily reflected the results of initiatives to adjust marketing expenditures and sales staffing  based on current operating levels  as well as lower selling commissions

table of contents historically  learning tree s quarterly operating results have fluctuated  and that is expected to continue in the future 
the fluctuations may be caused by many factors such as i the frequency of course events  ii the number of weeks during which courses can be conducted in a quarter  iii the timing  timely delivery  frequency and size of  and response to learning tree s direct mail marketing and advertising campaigns  iv the timing of the introduction of new course titles  v the mix between course events held at customer sites and course events held in learning tree s education centers and hotels due to differing gross profit margins  vi competitive forces within markets served by learning tree  vii learning tree s ability to attract customers and meet their expectations  viii currency fluctuations and other risks inherent in international operations  ix natural disasters  external strikes  acts of war or terrorism and other external factors  and x general economic conditions and industry specific slowdowns 
fluctuations in quarter to quarter results also occur as a result of differences in the timing of learning tree s spending on the marketing of its courses 
in addition  the timing of learning tree s spending on the development of its courses and other areas may also result  to a lesser extent  in quarter to quarter fluctuations

although learning tree expects to continue to invest in additional equipment in fiscal  as of october   learning tree had no material future purchase obligations  capital commitments or debt 
in the future  learning tree may use cash for acquisitions or other strategic transactions 
while learning tree has no current agreements in place or negotiations underway with respect to any acquisition or other strategic transaction  learning tree may  on occasion  evaluate acquisition opportunities that appear to fit within its overall business strategy 
learning tree believes its cash and cash equivalents and the cash provided by its operations will be sufficient to meet its cash requirements for the foreseeable future 
see exhibit  risk factors 
learning tree has not paid any cash dividends since its inception and does not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
the following table summarizes learning tree s contractual cash commitments at october  payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year fiscal years fiscal and years fiscal and more than years fiscal through operating leases employment contracts purchase commitments total

employment contracts reflect severance provisions of certain executive management employment contracts and other similar arrangements which may be payable in certain circumstances in the future 
some amounts reflect estimates as the actual cost of the severance is not defined in the contract 
represents estimated commitments at year end to purchase goods and services in the normal course of business to meet operational requirements 
these obligations are expected to be paid in future periods as stated in the table  although the amounts are subject to change based on operating requirements and other factors 
off balance sheet arrangements learning tree has no off balance sheet arrangements as defined in regulation s k item paragraph a ii that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on its financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
critical accounting estimates and policies management s discussion and analysis of learning tree s financial condition and results of operations is based upon learning tree s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the following list of critical accounting estimates and policies is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of learning tree s accounting policies 
learning tree s significant accounting policies are more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the following represents a summary of learning tree s critical accounting estimates and policies  defined as those policies that learning tree believes are the most important to the portrayal of learning tree s financial condition and results of operations  and or require management s significant judgments and estimates 
critical accounting estimates revenue recognition 
learning tree offers its customers a multiple course sales discount referred to as a training passport 
a training passport allows an individual passport holder to attend up to a specified number of learning tree courses over a one year period for a fixed price 
for a training passport  the amount of revenue recognized for each attendance in one of learning tree s courses is based upon the selling price of the training passport  the list price of the course taken and the estimated average number of courses passport holders will actually attend 
upon expiration of a training passport  learning tree records the difference  if any  between the revenues previously recognized and the training passport selling price 
the estimated attendance rate is based upon the historical experience of the average actual number of course events that training passport holders have been attending 
if the training passport attendance rates change  the revenue recognition rate for all active training passports and for all training passports sold thereafter is adjusted 
learning tree believes it is appropriate to recognize revenues on this basis in order to most closely match revenue and related costs  as the substantial majority of its passport holders do not attend the maximum number of course events permitted under their training passport 
learning tree believes that the use of historical data is reasonable and appropriate because of the relative stability of the average actual number of course events attended by the tens of thousands of passport holders since the inception of the program in fiscal the average actual attendance rate for all expired training passports has closely approximated the estimated rate utilized by learning tree 
although learning tree has seen no material changes in the historical rates as the 
table of contents number of course titles has changed  it monitors such potential effects 
in general  determining the estimated average number of course events that will be attended by a training passport holder is based on historical trends that may not continue in the future 
these estimates could differ in the near term from amounts used in arriving at the reported revenue 
if the estimates are wrong  learning tree would record the difference between the revenues previously recognized for that training passport and the training passport selling price upon expiration of that training passport 
thus  the timing of revenue recognition may be affected by an error in estimation  but the error would have no effect on the aggregate revenue recognized over the month life of each training passport 
allowance for doubtful accounts receivable 
trade accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
the company uses estimates in determining the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  based on its analysis of various factors  including the company s historical collection experience  current trends  specific identification of invoices which are considered doubtful  and a percentage of the company s past due accounts receivable 
although the company s estimates for this reserve have in the past been reasonably accurate  these estimates could differ from actual collection experience and are subject to adjustment 
the company s trade accounts receivable are written off when they are deemed uncollectible 
operating leases 
learning tree leases education center and administrative office space under various operating lease agreements 
certain of these operating leases include space that has not been used by learning tree and which is either currently subleased  or is vacant and for which learning tree is seeking a subtenant s 
for such vacated space  learning tree estimates and records the estimated fair value of its liability for costs that learning tree will incur under the operating lease without economic benefit 
the estimated fair value of the liability is determined based upon the remaining lease costs  as per the operating lease agreement  reduced by estimated sublease rental income that could be reasonably obtained for the property based upon prevailing real estate market conditions 
the liability recorded reflects learning tree s best estimate based upon the information available at the time 
learning tree adjusts the liability  as necessary  as new information becomes available or subsequent developments occur 
in  learning tree entered into a year lease on a building in london to house its united kingdom education center 
this building had sufficient space for learning tree s immediate classroom needs  plus three floors for potential future classroom expansion that learning tree has been subletting to two subtenants 
the first of these subleases has expired and the other subtenant notified learning tree in september  that it will vacate when its sublease expires on march  learning tree is actively seeking subtenants for these floors  as a whole or in parts  but has yet to sublease this space 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  learning tree recorded a  charge to reflect its estimate that a sublease with a new tenant for the currently vacant floor in its united kingdom education center is unlikely to be concluded much before march  this charge reflects learning tree s rent expense for the vacant floor from july  through march  however  there can be no assurance of when learning tree will complete a sublease of the currently vacant floor  or when it will find tenants for the other two floors 
to the extent that any of these floors are vacant after march   learning tree s general and administrative expenses will include a further charge of approximately  per quarter for each vacant floor 
accordingly  learning tree will make further provisions each quarter as necessary 
in addition  learning tree anticipates that in order to rent these floors in its united kingdom education center it may need to make certain concessions  such as a period of free rent 
such concessions could result in a net sublease rental rate that is somewhat less than the rental rate that learning tree pays on its lease 
therefore  learning tree also recorded a charge of  in the fourth quarter of fiscal for the net present value of the estimated difference between the net sublease rental rates that learning tree anticipates for these three floors and its costs over an expected year sublease period 
however  the actual vacancy period s  the actual sublease rental rate s  and the actual duration of the sublease s will be different from the estimates that learning tree has used in computing its estimate for this charge 

table of contents if learning tree s estimates are wrong  and such space is sublet sooner later  or at more less favorable rates  learning tree may have to record either additional charges or a reversal of previously recorded charges 
critical accounting policies revenue recognition 
learning tree course events range from two to five days  with an average of approximately four days 
as stated above  beginning with the second quarter of fiscal  learning tree adopted a or week fiscal year in order to better align its external financial reporting with the way learning tree operates its business 
under this method  each fiscal quarter ends on the friday closest to the end of the calendar quarter 
since all courses have a duration of five days or less  and all courses begin and end within the same calendar week  under the or week fiscal year method all revenues and related direct costs for each course event are recognized in the week and the fiscal quarter in which the event takes place 
prior to the adoption of the or week method  it was learning tree s policy to recognize revenues and the related direct costs of course events as courses are delivered on a straight line basis 
however  for administrative purposes  the revenues and the related costs of course events were recorded upon commencement of each course event  unless the difference between learning tree s revenue recognition policy and recording revenues and related course costs on a straight line basis was more than inconsequential 
in addition to its training passports  learning tree also offers a multiple course sales discount referred to as training vouchers 
under learning tree s training vouchers  a customer buys the right to send a specified number of attendees to learning tree courses over a one year period for a fixed price 
revenue is recognized on a pro rata basis for each attendance 
if a training voucher expires unused  learning tree records the selling price of the expired training voucher as revenue 
prepaid marketing expenses 
prepaid marketing expenses are charged to income in the month in which the advertising materials are mailed since the benefit period for such costs is short and the amount of such future benefit is not practically measurable 
course development costs 
course development costs are charged to operations in the period incurred 
stock based compensation 
learning tree uses the intrinsic value method under apb opinion no 
accounting for stock issued to employees  in accounting for its stock option plans 
the exercise price of all stock options granted under learning tree s stock option plans was equal to their fair market value at the dates of the grants 
accordingly  no compensation cost was recognized during fiscal and fiscal for stock options granted to employees 
facilities  intangible and other long lived assets 
learning tree periodically reviews the carrying value of its facilities  intangible and other long lived assets to identify and assess any impairment of the carrying value 
income taxes 
learning tree applies sfas no 
accounting for income taxes  in accounting for income taxes 
under sfas no 
 deferred income tax assets and liabilities arise from carry forwards and from temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the book basis of such assets and liabilities as reported in the financial statements 
deferred income tax assets arise from expected reductions in taxes payable in future periods 
deferred tax assets reflect management s estimate of the amounts that will be realized from future profitability and can be predicted with reasonable certainty 
deferred income tax liabilities represent taxes that learning tree expects to pay in future periods 
outlook for fiscal throughout this document  there have been various forward looking statements 
however  all of the statements in this section are forward looking and are subject to various risks and uncertainties  including those detailed from time to time in learning tree s filings with the securities and exchange commission and in 
table of contents exhibit  risk factors 
since economic and market conditions may change at any time  learning tree s future revenues  plans and expenditures will vary from the observations below  and these differences may be material 
recent trends 
learning tree s business continues to be influenced by world events  by the economy  and by corporate spending trends for it  among other factors 
learning tree believes that the best way to counteract adverse market trends is to use a strong  focused  integrated marketing and sales strategy that clearly and visibly helps learning tree s customers identify specific applications of training services to improve their business performance 
accordingly  learning tree continues to assess alternative approaches to sales and marketing with the objective of improving its performance under current market conditions 
effect of exchange rates 
approximately half of learning tree s business is conducted in currencies other than us dollars and fluctuations in exchange rates will affect future revenues and expenses when translated into dollars 
if the exchange rates of november  remain stable through the remainder of fiscal  learning tree s revenues would be favorably affected by approximately in the first quarter and approximately for the full fiscal year compared to the corresponding periods in fiscal conversely  learning tree s expenses would be unfavorably affected by similar percentages in these periods 
first quarter revenues 
a number of factors may influence learning tree s revenues in its first fiscal quarter ending december  these include the following learning tree has yet to see any sustained improvement in demand for it skills training from its customers 
at october   learning tree s backlog of million was about lower than it had been on september  this october  backlog included a favorable effect from changes in foreign exchange rates 
four weeks later  at october   learning tree s overall backlog of million was lower than at october  and  at october   the sum of learning tree s revenues for october courses plus its backlog for november and december courses was lower than it had been at october  these october  backlogs each included a favorable effect from changes in foreign exchange rates 
based upon the above and other factors  learning tree believes that its revenues in the first quarter of fiscal will be approximately million to million  or to lower than the prior year period 
first quarter gross profit 
learning tree expects its gross profit percentage in the first quarter of fiscal to be between and first quarter operating expenses 
learning tree expects overall operating expenses for the first quarter of fiscal to be approximately million  an increase of approximately  compared to the same quarter a year earlier 
this increase primarily reflects the effect of changes in exchange rates and annual compensation increases 
learning tree expects this increase to be partially offset by lower marketing costs due to the net effect of mailing fewer regular catalogs than in the same quarter of fiscal and the increased costs of mailing management curriculum catalogs in fiscal  which learning tree first introduced in the second quarter of fiscal first quarter interest income 
learning tree s interest income reflects changes in interest rates  as well as changes in cash balances 
learning tree expects first quarter interest income to be approximately the same as it was in the fourth quarter of fiscal tax rate 
learning tree estimates that its effective tax rate in fiscal will be approximately as a result of utilizing foreign tax credits during the year 
future outlook 
looking forward  learning tree remains confident in the long term outlook for the technology industry and the need for it and management training 
learning tree believes that technology 
table of contents provides mission critical resources that can be used by organizations to gain a competitive advantage  provided that their technical personnel are adequately trained in the technologies they are using 
learning tree believes that even more critical is the training of managers at all levels in an organization 
studies show again and again that effective training in basic and applied management skills increases the likelihood of successful project implementation  reduces risk and costs and increases overall organizational performance 
learning tree s strong global brand  operational strengths and financial resources position it to respond both to the current business environment and to future opportunities that may develop 
learning tree plans to continue to apply learning tree s considerable resources to provide the best possible service to its customers with the expectation of maintaining their continuing loyalty and capturing additional market share 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk learning tree s cash equivalents are diversified and consist primarily of investment grade securities of high quality financial institutions and corporations 
the fair value of learning tree s portfolio of marketable securities would not be significantly impacted by either a percent approximately basis points increase or decrease in the rates of interest due primarily to the short term nature of the portfolio 
learning tree does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments 
learning tree s consolidated financial statements are prepared in us dollars  while the operations of its foreign subsidiaries are conducted in their respective local currencies 
consequently  changes in exchange rates can result in exchange gains or losses 
the impact of future exchange rates on learning tree s results of operations cannot be accurately predicted 
to date  learning tree has not sought to hedge the risks associated with fluctuations in exchange rates and therefore continues to be subject to such risks 
in the future  learning tree may undertake such transactions 
however  any hedging techniques implemented by learning tree might not be successful in eliminating or reducing the effects of currency fluctuations
