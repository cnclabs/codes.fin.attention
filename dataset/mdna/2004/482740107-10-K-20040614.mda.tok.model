these risks  uncertainties and other factors are discussed throughout this report and specifically under the caption cautionary statement regarding forward looking information and risk factors 
in addition  the following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this form k 
background we are a fully integrated specialty pharmaceutical company that develops  acquires  manufactures  and markets technologically distinguished branded and generic non branded prescription pharmaceutical products 
we were incorporated in and have become a leader in the development of advanced drug delivery and formulation technologies that are designed to enhance therapeutic benefits of existing drug forms 
through internal product development and synergistic acquisitions of products  we have grown into a fully integrated specialty pharmaceutical company 
we also develop  manufacture and market technologically advanced  value added raw material products for the pharmaceutical  nutritional  food and personal care industries 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are presented on the basis of accounting principles that are generally accepted in the united states 
our significant accounting policies are described in note in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
certain of our accounting policies are particularly important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management 
as a result  these policies are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
in applying these policies  our management makes estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures 
we base our estimates and judgments on our historical experience  the terms of existing contracts  our observance of trends in the industry  information that we obtain from our customers and outside sources  and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable and appropriate under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
although we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable  actual results may differ significantly from these estimates 
changes in estimates and assumptions based upon actual results may have a material impact on our results of operations and or financial condition 
our critical accounting policies are described below 
revenue and provision for sales returns and allowances 
when we sell our products  we reduce the amount of revenue we recognize from such sale by an estimate of future product returns and sales allowances 
sales allowances include cash discounts  rebates  chargebacks  and other similar expected future payments relating to product sold in the current period 
factors that are considered in our estimates of future product returns and sales allowances include historical payment experience in relationship to revenues  estimated customer inventory levels  and current contract prices and terms with both direct and indirect customers 
if actual future payments for product returns and sales allowances exceed the estimates we made at the time of sale  our financial position  results of operations and cash flows would be negatively impacted 
the provision for chargebacks is the most significant and complex estimate used in the recognition of revenue 
we establish contract prices for indirect customers who are supplied by our wholesale customers 
a chargeback represents the difference between our invoice price to the wholesaler and the indirect customer s contract price  which is lower 
we credit the wholesaler for purchases by indirect customers at the lower price 
accordingly  we record these chargebacks at the time we recognize revenue in connection with our sales to wholesalers 
provisions for estimating chargebacks are calculated primarily using historical chargeback experience  actual contract pricing and estimated wholesaler inventory levels 
we continually monitor our assumptions giving consideration to estimated wholesaler inventory levels and current pricing trends and make adjustments to these estimates when we believe that the actual chargeback amounts payable in the future will differ from our original estimates 
allowance for inventories 
inventories consist of finished goods held for distribution  raw materials and work in process 
our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined on the first in  first out basis 
in evaluating whether inventory is to be stated at the lower of cost or market  we consider such factors as the amount of inventory on hand and in the distribution channel  estimated time required to sell existing inventory  remaining shelf life and current and expected market conditions  including levels of competition 
we establish reserves  when necessary  for slow moving and obsolete inventories based upon our historical experience and management s assessment of current product demand 
intangible assets and goodwill 
our intangible assets consist of product rights  license agreements and trademarks resulting from product acquisitions and legal fees and similar costs relating to the development of patents and trademarks 
intangible assets that are acquired are stated at cost  less accumulated amortization  and are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives 
upon approval  costs associated with the development of patents and trademarks are amortized on a straight line basis over estimated useful lives ranging from five to years 
we determine amortization periods for intangible assets that are acquired based on our assessment of various factors impacting estimated useful lives and cash flows of the acquired products 
such factors include the product s position in its life cycle  the existence or absence of like products in the market  various other competitive and regulatory issues  and contractual terms 
significant changes to any of these factors may result in a reduction in the intangible asset s useful life and an acceleration of related amortization expense 
we assess the impairment of intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
some factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangible assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we first perform an assessment of the asset s recoverability 
recoverability is determined by comparing the carrying amount of an intangible asset against an estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition 
if the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the intangible asset  an impairment loss is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount over the estimated fair value of the intangible asset 
results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal net revenues by segment years ended march  change in thousands branded products    as of net revenues specialty generics    as of net revenues specialty materials   as of net revenues other    total net revenues    the increase in branded product sales was due primarily to continued growth of our women s healthcare family of products and the sales impact of products acquired by us on march  the increase was also impacted by a march  price increase instituted by ther rx on all of its products 
in anticipation of the scheduled price increase  customers made larger than normal purchases  which the company limits to a day supply and is consistent with prior price increase policies 
this forward purchasing approximated million during the fourth quarter 
sales from the women s healthcare product group increased million  or  in fiscal included in the women s healthcare family of products is the precare r product line which contributed million of incremental sales in fiscal this increase was attributable to increased sales volume associated with higher market shares for primacare r  our prescription prenatal postnatal multivitamin and mineral supplement with essential fatty acids  and the precare r prenatal vitamin 
the precare r family of products continues to be the leading branded line of prescription prenatal nutritional supplements in the united states as market share for the product line grew to at the end of fiscal compared to at the end of fiscal sales of gynazole r  our vaginal antifungal cream product  increased million  or  during fiscal as our share of the prescription vaginal antifungal cream market increased to at the end of fiscal  from at the end of the prior year 
the increase in sales from our women s healthcare family of products was supplemented by million of sales during fiscal from our two hematinic product lines  chromagen r and niferex r  and the strongstart r prenatal vitamin product line that we acquired at the end of fiscal since we introduced technology improved versions of the hematinic products in the second quarter of fiscal  these products have generated a growth rate in new prescription volume 
the increase in branded product sales for fiscal was partially offset by a million decline in sales of the micro k r product line 
the minimal growth in specialty generic sales resulted from million of incremental sales volume from new product introductions  primarily in the cough cold  cardiovascular and prenatal vitamin product lines  offset by a million decline in sales volume from existing products primarily in our cough cold product line 
during fiscal  we introduced new products  including the february anda approval for four strengths of benazepril hydrochloride tablets generic equivalent to lotensin r 
the decline in sales of existing cough cold products was due primarily to an fda order which required us and all manufacturers of unapproved single ingredient  extended release guaifenesin products to discontinue distribution of these products after november the fda ruling affected five of our guaifenesin products that were first introduced when anda approval was not required 
also  we experienced slower than anticipated anda approvals by the fda on a number of brand equivalent products that we expected to introduce in fiscal we anticipate these approvals will occur in fiscal and  as a result  we expect specialty generic sales growth to return to higher levels in fiscal the first of these approvals was received in may for two strengths of morphine sulphate extended release tablets which are the generic equivalent to ms contin r 
the decrease in specialty material product sales was primarily due to a slowdown in a major customer s business in the vitamin supplement market 
the decrease in other revenue resulted from a smaller contract manufacturing customer base due to continued de emphasis of this lower margin operation in our business strategy 
gross profit by segment years ended march  change in thousands branded products    as of net revenues specialty generics    as of net revenues specialty materials   as of net revenues other  total gross profit    as of total net revenues the increase in consolidated gross profit was primarily attributable to the sales growth experienced by the branded products and specialty generics segments  offset in part by a sales decline in the specialty materials segment 
the increased gross profit percentage on a consolidated basis reflected a favorable shift in the mix of product sales toward higher margin branded products  which comprised a larger percentage of net revenues 
the gross profit percentage decrease experienced by the branded products segment was due to the acquired hematinic products  which have a slightly lower gross margin than other products in the branded line 
while the gross profit percentage in specialty generics increased for the fiscal year  the segment experienced a decline in gross profit as a percent of net revenues during the fourth quarter due to more competitive pricing and higher costs associated with a new product launch 
gross profit as a percent of net revenues also declined in the specialty raw materials segment during the fourth quarter as a result of unfavorable cost variances associated with lower production volume 
research and development years ended march  change in thousands research and development    as of net revenues the increase in research and development expense resulted from higher costs associated with the continued expansion of clinical testing for our product development efforts and increased personnel expenses related to the growth of our research and development staff 
the increase in research and development expense was below management s expectation of greater spending due to rescheduling the timing of certain clinical studies 
in fiscal  we expect research and development costs to increase by approximately over fiscal levels 
selling and administrative years ended march  change in thousands selling and administrative    as of net revenues the increase in selling and administrative expense was primarily due to greater personnel expenses resulting from an increase in management personnel million and expansion of the branded sales force million  an increase in rent  depreciation and utilities associated with recently added facilities million  and an increase in branded marketing expense million commensurate with the growth of the segment and to support the launch and on going promotion of technology improved versions of the chromagen r and niferex r products we acquired at the end of fiscal we also experienced a million increase in legal expense due to an increase in litigation activity coupled with the appeal of the healthpoint litigation see note in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements  paragraph iv litigation and other matters 
we anticipate that selling and administrative expenses could increase as much as to for fiscal reflecting a full year of our most recent sales force expansion to more than sales representatives  continued expected increases in litigation expenses associated with anda patent challenges  and the expected approval and launch of a new women s healthcare branded product planned for the second half of fiscal to the extent the approval of this product by the fda is delayed  anticipated expense spending levels would be diminished 
amortization of intangible assets years ended march  change in thousands amortization of intangible assets    as of net revenues the increase in amortization of intangible assets was due primarily to the amortization of trademarks acquired in the two product acquisitions completed on march  litigation years ended march  change in thousands litigation    in september  we recorded a litigation reserve of million for potential damages associated with the adverse decision made by a federal court in texas to uphold a jury verdict in a lawsuit against ethex 
during fiscal  we recorded an additional litigation reserve of million related to this matter for attorney s fees awarded to the plaintiffs by the court see note in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
the impact of this reserve was more than offset by a million net payment  received by us during fiscal  for a settlement with a branded company of our claim that the branded company interfered with our right to a timely introduction of a generic product in a previous fiscal year 
operating income years ended march  change in thousands operating income    the increase in operating income resulted primarily from a million  or  increase in gross profit in fiscal  offset in part by a million increase in fiscal operating expenses 
the million increase in our fiscal selling and administrative expenses was primarily offset by the impact on fiscal operating expenses of a million litigation reserve established by us for potential damages associated with a lawsuit that is currently under appeal 
interest expense years ended march  change in thousands interest expense    the increase in interest expense resulted primarily from the interest expense accrued on the million of convertible subordinated notes issued may  interest and other income years ended march  change in thousands interest and other income   the increase in interest and other income was due to the investment of million of net proceeds from the may convertible subordinated notes offering in short term  highly liquid investments combined with the impact of an million increase in short term investments during fiscal from the proceeds of a secondary offering during that year 
provision for income taxes years ended march  change in thousands provision for income taxes    effective tax rate the increase in the provision for income taxes resulted from a corresponding increase in income before taxes 
the decline in the effective tax rate primarily resulted from the implementation of various tax planning initiatives  as well as the generation of income tax credits at both the federal and state levels 
net income years ended march  change in thousands net income    diluted earnings per share the increase in net income resulted primarily from a million  or  increase in our fiscal net revenues coupled with the impact on fiscal net income of a million litigation reserve established by us for potential damages associated with a lawsuit that is currently under appeal 
fiscal compared to fiscal net revenues by segment years ended march  change in thousands branded products    as of net revenues specialty generics    as of net revenues specialty materials    as of net revenues other    total net revenues    the increase in branded product sales was due to continued growth of our women s healthcare family of products 
sales from this product group increased million  or  in fiscal gynazole r  our vaginal antifungal product  continued its market penetration as its market share increased to at the end of fiscal  compared to at the end of the prior fiscal year 
due to its continued growth in market share  sales of gynazole r increased million  or during the year 
also included in the women s healthcare family of products is the precare r product line which contributed million of incremental sales in fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to increased sales volume associated with primacare r  a prescription prenatal postnatal multivitamin and mineral supplement with essential fatty acids  which has continued to show growth in market share since its introduction in the fourth quarter of fiscal further  the precare r family of products is currently the leading branded line of prescription prenatal nutritional supplements in the united states 
increased sales from the women s healthcare family of products was partially offset by a million  or  decline in sales from the branded products cardiovascular product line 
the decrease in cardiovascular sales was due to the impact of customer buying during the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year in anticipation of a year end price increase coupled with increased substitution of our generic equivalent products 
the increase in sales for specialty generics resulted primarily from higher sales volume in the cardiovascular  pain management and cough cold product lines  coupled with continued expansion of our other product lines  including gastrointestinal and anti anxiety 
increased sales from these product lines were partially offset by a reduction in sales in our prenatal vitamin product line 
the cardiovascular product line  which comprised of specialty generic sales in fiscal  contributed million of increased sales from existing products and million of incremental sales volume from the april anda approval and subsequent launch of potassium chloride mg 
tablets generic equivalent to k dur r 
sales volume for the pain management product line increased million due to market share gains coupled with the impact of a full year of sales of two products introduced in the prior year 
the remaining million of increased sales volume resulted primarily from new product introductions in the cough cold  gastrointestinal and anti anxiety product lines coupled with a full year of sales on products introduced in the prior year 
we introduced and new specialty generic non branded products in fiscal and  respectively 
the million decline in sales volume for the prenatal product line was primarily attributable to a reduction in the corresponding brand equivalent market 
this market decline was due  in part  to the introduction of primacare r by our branded products segment in the fourth quarter of fiscal the increased sales volume experienced by specialty generics during fiscal was partially offset by million of product price erosion that resulted primarily from normal and expected pricing pressures in the pain management and cough cold product lines 
the decrease in specialty material product sales was primarily due to an unexpected softness in the nutritional supplement market for which the specialty materials segment is a supplier 
gross profit by segment years ended march  change in thousands branded products    as of net revenues specialty generics    as of net revenues specialty materials    as of net revenues other   total gross profit    as of total net revenues the increase in gross profit was attributable to the sales growth experienced by the branded products and specialty generics segments  offset partially by a sales decline in the specialty materials segment 
the higher gross profit percentage was favorably impacted by price increases of branded products that took effect at the beginning of fiscal and higher margins realized on new specialty generic products introduced during the current and prior fiscal years 
the gross profit percentage increases experienced by the branded products and specialty generics segments were partially offset by a decline in the gross profit percentage at the specialty raw materials segment 
this decline resulted from unfavorable cost variances associated with lower production 
research and development years ended march  change in thousands research and development    as of net revenues the increase in research and development expense was primarily due to higher costs associated with the expansion of clinical testing connected to our internal product development efforts and higher personnel expenses related to the growth of our research and development staff 
selling and administrative years ended march  change in thousands selling and administrative    as of net revenues the increase in selling and administrative expense resulted primarily from an increase in specialty generic non branded marketing and promotional expenses  an increase in personnel costs associated with corporate administration and branded products marketing and higher insurance costs 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction in legal expenses which resulted from insurance reimbursements of defense costs in the healthpoint litigation 
amortization of intangible assets years ended march  change in thousands amortization of intangible assets   the decrease in amortization of intangible assets was due primarily to the implementation of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which discontinued the amortization of goodwill effective april  see note in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements

the impact of the litigation reserve  net of applicable taxes  reduced net income by million

liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents and working capital were million and million  respectively  at march   compared to million and million  respectively  at march  internally generated funds from product sales continued to be the primary source of operating capital used in the funding of our businesses 
the net cash flow from operating activities was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal this decrease resulted primarily from a decline in reserve balances associated with sales returns and allowances  an increase in inventories related to a number of specialty generic products we expect to launch in the first half of fiscal and increased inventories associated with the hematinic brands that we acquired at the end of fiscal  an increase in prepaid and other assets  and a decrease in current liabilities due primarily to the timing of payments made on accounts payable and accrued income taxes 
the decrease in net cash flow from operating activities in fiscal was partially offset by an increase in net income 
net cash flow used in investing activities was million for fiscal compared to million for the prior year 
capital expenditures of million were primarily for purchasing machinery and equipment to upgrade and expand our pharmaceutical manufacturing and distribution capabilities  and other building renovation projects 
we expect our capital expenditures in fiscal to increase by up to million as we ramp up manufacturing distribution  laboratory capabilities and other facilities needed for planned growth over the next five to seven years 
other investing activities in fiscal included a million payment related to the purchase of certain licensing rights combined with an equity investment in femmepharma  inc  a women s healthcare company 
in january  we made an additional million payment to femmepharma  inc to complete the purchase of certain trademark rights for a product under development and to increase our equity investment in the company 
on march   we acquired the product rights and trademarks to the niferex r line of hematinic products for a cash payment made in april for million 
also  on march   we completed the purchase of product rights and trademarks to the chromagen r and strongstart r product lines for a million cash payment made on march  and two non interest bearing million promissory notes  one of which was repaid in fiscal and the other of which is due on march  debt increased to million at march  compared to million at march  the increase primarily resulted from the issuance in may of million in convertible subordinated notes that are convertible  under certain circumstances  into shares of our class a common stock at an initial conversion price of per share 
the convertible subordinated notes bear interest at a rate of and mature on may  we are also obligated to pay contingent interest at a rate equal to per annum during any six month period from may to november and from november to may  with the initial six month period commencing may   if the average trading price of the notes per  principal amount for the five trading day period ending on the third trading day immediately preceding the first day of the applicable six month period equals  or more 
we may redeem some or all of the convertible subordinated notes at any time on or after may   at a redemption price  payable in cash  of of the principal amount of the convertible subordinated notes  plus accrued and unpaid interest including contingent interest  if any to the date of redemption 
holders may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their convertible subordinated notes on may     and  or upon a change in control  as defined in the indenture governing the convertible subordinated notes  at of the principal amount of the convertible subordinated notes  plus accrued and unpaid interest including contingent interest  if any to the date of repurchase  payable in cash 
the convertible subordinated notes are subordinate to all of our existing and future senior obligations 
the net proceeds to us were million  after deducting underwriting discounts  commissions and offering expenses 
in april  we financed the purchase of an million building with a term loan secured by the property under a floating rate loan with a bank 
the facility consists of approximately  square feet of office  production  distribution and warehouse space that we are currently renovating 
the remaining principal balance plus any unpaid interest is due in april we also entered into an interest rate swap agreement with the same bank  which fixed the interest rate of the building mortgage at for the term of the loan 
during may  we used million of the net proceeds from the convertible subordinated notes issuance to fund the repurchase of million shares of our class a common stock 
we currently have a million unsecured revolving line of credit with a bank that expires in october in december  we increased our unsecured supplemental credit line with the same bank from million to million 
the unsecured supplemental credit line of million  which is available for financing acquisitions  expires in december at march   we had million in open letters of credit issued under the revolving credit line and no cash borrowings under either credit facility 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations in thousands less than more than total year years years years obligations at march  long term debt obligations      operating lease obligations      other long term obligations   total contractual cash obligations      we believe our cash and cash equivalents balance  cash flows from operations  funds available under our credit facilities  and proceeds received from the convertible subordinated notes issuance will be adequate to fund operating activities for the presently foreseeable future  including an increase in debt obligations  a significant increase in capital expenditures  higher research and development costs  product development activities and expansion of marketing capabilities for the branded pharmaceutical business 
in addition  we continue to examine opportunities to expand our business through the acquisition of or investment in companies  technologies  product rights  research and development and other investments that are compatible with existing businesses 
we intend to use our available cash to help in funding any acquisitions or investments 
as such  cash has been invested in short term  highly liquid instruments 
we also may use funds available under our credit facility  or financing sources that subsequently become available  including the future issuances of additional debt or equity securities  to fund these acquisitions or investments 
if we were to fund one or more such acquisitions or investments  our capital resources  financial condition and results of operations could be materially impacted in future periods 
inflation inflation may apply upward pressure on the cost of goods and services used by us in the future 
however  we believe that the net effect of inflation on our operations during the past three years has been minimal 
in addition  changes in the mix of products sold and the effect of competition has made a comparison of changes in selling prices less meaningful relative to changes in the overall rate of inflation over the past three fiscal years 
recently issued accounting standards in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
the primary objectives of fin are to provide guidance on the identification of entities which a company may control through means other than through voting rights variable interest entities and to determine when and which business enterprise primary beneficiary should consolidate the variable interest entity 
fin requires existing unconsolidated variable interest entities to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries if the entities do not effectively disperse risks among the parties involved 
variable interest entities that effectively disperse risks will not be consolidated unless a single party holds an interest or combination of interests that effectively recombines risks that were previously dispersed 
in addition  fin requires that the primary beneficiary  as well as all other enterprises with a significant variable interest in a variable interest entity  make additional disclosures 
certain disclosure requirements of fin were effective for financial statements issued after january  in december  the fasb revised fin fin r to address certain fin implementation issues 
the revised provisions were applicable no later than the first reporting period ending after march  we adopted fin and fin r on march  and  based upon the evaluation performed of all interests  have determined we do not have any variable interest entities that require consolidation 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas establishes standards for how entities classify and measure in their statement of financial position certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
the provisions of sfas are effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise at the beginning of the first fiscal interim period beginning after june  the adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in april  the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
fsp  disclosure requirements under fasb statement no 
 disclosure of information about capital structure  relating to contingently convertible securities 
this fsp requires the disclosure provisions of statement to apply to all existing and newly created contingently convertible securities and to their potentially dilutive effects on earnings per share 
the adoption of the disclosure provisions of fsp did not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk is limited to fluctuating interest rates associated with variable rate indebtedness that is subject to interest rate changes 
advances to us under our credit facilities bear interest at a rate that varies consistent with increases or decreases in the publicly announced prime rate and or the libor rate with respect to libor related loans  if any 
a material increase in such rates could significantly increase borrowing expenses 
we did not have any cash borrowings under our credit facilities at march  in may  we issued million of convertible subordinated notes 
the interest rate on the convertible subordinated notes is fixed at per annum and not subject to market interest rate changes 
in april  we entered into an million term loan secured by a building under a floating rate loan with a bank 
we also entered into an interest rate swap agreement with the same bank  which fixed the interest rate of the building mortgage at for the term of the loan
