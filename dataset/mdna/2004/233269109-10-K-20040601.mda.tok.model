item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes to those statements included elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains certain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  such as statement of our plans  objectives  expectations and intentions 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed here 
the cautionary statements made in this report should be read as being applicable to all forward looking statements wherever they appear 
numerous important factors  risks and uncertainties affect our operations and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these or any other forward looking statements made by us or on our behalf 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed in risk factors  as well as those discussed elsewhere herein 
we undertake no obligation to publicly release the result of any revisions to these forward looking statements that may be required to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 
fluctuations in operating results our results of operations and gross margin have been subject to fluctuations from period to period 
the primary factors that have affected and may in the future affect our results of operations  include  adverse changes in the mix of products sold  the inability to procure required components  the size of investments in new technologies or product lines  and the partial or complete loss of a principal customer or the reduction in orders from a customer due to  among other things  excess product inventory accumulation by such customer 
other factors that have affected and may in the future affect our results of operations include fluctuating market demand for and declines in the selling prices of our products  decreases or increases in the costs of the components of our products  market acceptance of new products and enhanced versions of our products  our competitors selling products that compete with our products at lower prices or on better terms than we sell our products  delays in our introduction of new products or software problems and in our making enhancements to existing products  manufacturing inefficiencies associated with the start up of new product introductions  inability to develop new wireless products using newer technology  and production from overseas suppliers 
our operating results may also be affected by the timing of new product announcements and releases by us or our competitors  the timing of significant orders  the ability to produce products in volume  delays  cancellations or rescheduling of orders due to customer financial difficulties or other events  inventory obsolescence  including the reduction in value of our inventories due to price declines  unexpected product returns  the timing of expenditures in anticipation of increased sales  cyclicality in our targeted markets  and expenses associated with acquisitions 
in particular  declines in standard or similar technology prices could affect the valuation of our inventory  the pricing of services  which could result in adverse changes in our business  financial condition and results of operations 
many of these same conditions apply to the products being developed for the wireless market 
sales of our individual products and product lines toward the end of a product s life cycle are typically characterized by steep declines in sales  pricing and gross margin  the precise timing of which may be difficult to predict 
we have experienced and could continue to experience unexpected reductions in sales of products as customers anticipate new product purchases 
in addition  to the extent that we manufacture products in anticipation of future demand that does not materialize  or in the event a customer cancels outstanding orders during a period of either declining product selling prices or decreasing demand  we could experience an unanticipated decrease in sales of products 
these factors could give rise to charges for obsolete or excess inventory  returns of products by distributors  or substantial price protection charges or discounts 
in the past  we have had to write down and write off excess or obsolete inventory 
to the extent that we are unsuccessful in managing product transitions  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
from time to time  our customers may purchase products from us in large quantities over a short period of time  which may cause demand for our products to change rapidly 
due to these and other uncertainties associated with customers purchasing strategies  we may experience significant fluctuations in demand from our customers 
such fluctuations could cause a significant increase in demand that could exceed our suppliers production capacity and could negatively impact our ability to meet customers demands as well as potentially impact product quality 
alternatively  such fluctuations could cause a significant reduction in revenues  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we cannot guarantee that a major customer will not reduce  delay or eliminate purchases from us  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
the need for continued significant expenditures for research and development  software and firmware enhancements  and ongoing customer service and support  among other factors  will make it difficult for us to reduce our operating expenses in any particular period if our expectations for net sales for that period are not met or our investment objective for future revenues streams need to continue for potential success 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that we will be able to be profitable in any future period 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of good future performance 
due to the foregoing factors  it is likely that in some future period our operating results will be below the expectations of public market analysts or investors 
in such event  the market price of our common stock or other securities would be materially and adversely affected 
critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
as such  we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
the significant accounting policies which we believe are the most subjective and critical  to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following revenue recognition dpac recognizes revenue from product sales at the time of shipment and passage of title 
we only offer our customers the right to return products that do not function properly within a limited time after delivery 
while such returns have historically been insignificant and within our expectations  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same return rates that we have in the past 
any significant increase in product failure rates  including our newly introduced wireless products  and the resulting credit returns could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the period or periods in which such returns materialize 
accounts receivable we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
the amount of our reserves is based on historical experience and our analysis of the accounts receivable balances outstanding 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required which would result in an additional general and administrative expense in the period such determination was made 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past  which could adversely affect our operating results 
inventories we value our inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase and or manufacture or the current estimated market value of the inventory 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements for the next twelve months 
a significant increase in the demand for our products could result in a short term increase in the cost of inventory purchases while a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand 
additionally  our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have understated or overstated the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
in the future  if our inventory is determined to be overvalued  we would be required to recognize such costs in our cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
likewise  if our inventory is determined to be undervalued  we may have over reported our costs of goods sold in previous periods and would be required to recognize such additional operating income at the time of sale of the related inventory 
therefore  although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
property  plant and equipment the company periodically reviews the recoverability of its long lived assets using the methodology prescribed in sfas no 
the company also reviews these assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of these assets is determined by comparing the forecasted undiscounted future net cash flows from the operations to which the assets relate  based on management s best estimates using appropriate assumptions and projections at the time  to the carrying amount of the assets 
if the carrying value is determined not to be recoverable from future operating cash flows  the asset is deemed impaired and an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset 
significant changes in the company s operations  such as those occurring in the lp stacking market in fiscal  result in changes to our estimated future cash flows 
such changes necessitated asset write downs of approximately million in fiscal goodwill we review the recoverability of the carrying value of goodwill on an annual basis or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change to indicate that an impairment of goodwill has possibly occurred 
since we operate in a single business segment as a single business unit  the determination of whether any potential impairment of goodwill exists is based on a comparison of the fair value of the entire company to the carrying value of our net assets 
in estimating the fair value of the entire company  we review the average and closing stock prices for our common stock  as well as other factors 
if the fair value of the entire company is determined to be less than the carrying value of our net assets  we could be required to record an impairment loss for our goodwill that could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the period in which such charge was recorded 
as of february   the carrying value of our goodwill was approximately million and no impairment existed based on the company s most recent analysis 
deferred taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying values and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
dpac regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability and establishes a valuation allowance based on historical taxable income  projected future taxable income  and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
during the third quarter  we experienced an significant decrease on our operating results  which continued throughout the second half of the year 
during the third quarter of fiscal year  we determined it was more likely then not that we would not be able to recover such net deferred tax assets and we recorded a valuation allowance against all of our net deferred tax assets which substantially increased our effective tax rate for this period and the entire fiscal year 
any significant changes in statutory tax rates or changes in our assessment of deferred tax asset recoverability could have a material impact on the value of our deferred tax assets and liabilities  and our reported financial results 
stock based compensation the company accounts for employee stock based compensation under the intrinsic value method prescribed in accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  as opposed to the optional fair value method prescribed by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
pursuant to the provisions of apb  we generally do not record an expense for the value of stock based awards granted to employees 
if proposals currently under consideration by various accounting standards organizations and governmental authorities are adopted  we may be required to treat the value of stock based awards granted to employees as compensation expense in the future  which could have a material adverse impact on our reported operating results and could negatively impact the price of our common stock 
if these proposals are adopted  we could decide to reduce the number of stock based awards granted to employees in the future  which could adversely impact our ability to attract qualified candidates or retain existing employees without increasing their cash compensation and  therefore  have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
results of operations the following table summarized dpac s results of operations as a percentage of net sales for the three fiscal years ended february  as a percentage of net sales fiscal years ended february  net sales total cost of sales gross profit operating expenses selling  general and administrative research and development restructuring and impairment charges goodwill amortization total operating expenses loss income from operations other income  net loss income before income tax provision income tax provision benefit net loss income fiscal year ended on february fiscal year compared to fiscal year net sales fiscal year net sales of  decreased by  or from fiscal year net sales of  stacking revenues containing purchased memory  or memory stacking  involves dpac purchasing memory chips  stacking them  and then selling the stacked product to the customer 
in these cases where the costs of memory chips are included in the sales price of products  the company will purchase material for the commercial order concurrently with finalizing the sales price thereof  in order to avoid any price volatility in the components 
revenues from memory stacking may vary significantly from period to period based not only on quantities shipped but also on the current market price of purchased memory 
the balance of commercial stacking revenues is from service stacking  where customers provide us with consigned memory chips and we provide services to configure and stack the memory to customer specifications 
as there is no memory chip component cost to service stacking  revenues per unit are significantly lower than revenues per unit of memory stacking sales 
of total revenue in fiscal year  approximately  related to memory stacking and approximately  to service stacking  as compared with  and  respectively  in fiscal year this increase was caused by a change in customer mix  where a higher percentage of our sales were to customers using purchased memory 
during the fiscal year the quantity of lp stacks sold decreased by or approximately  stacks 
the decrease in net sales was primarily due to the following factors decrease stacking units sold due to technology changes the decrease can be attributed to a change in technology to a lower profile dimm memory module  which makes the configuration of our stack more difficult for our customer to use 
competitors entering the stacking market there were several new competitors that entered the market place  primarily the semiconductor companies 
companies like samsung and infineon  we believe currently hold greater than of the stacking market 
this is due to their business model focused on moving memory as their primary purpose and using stacking as one method to accomplish that purpose 
therefore stacking is an additional feature that can be incorporated into the end product instead of a value added proposal 
decrease of average selling prices as more competitors entered the market  and dram prices decreased  pricing became a larger overall factor in the competitive market 
customers were able to obtain competitive price quotes and obtain lower prices associated with the stacking service 
dpac experienced a decrease in overall pricing of our stacking model by approximately from the prior fiscal year 
dram memory price fluctuation the dpac model will either charge for the service of stacking or buy the memory from the customer and then charge for the stacking service and the memory 
the overall decrease in the service portion of the stacking business decreased by which represented approximately of net sales 
the memory component portion of the stacking business represented of the business and due primarily to the decrease in stacking volume and declining dram prices  the memory component of revenues decreased by from the previous year 
the other dpac product lines include ceramic based memory products as well as system products for the telecommunications and defense industry 
our revenue decreased in these areas by million or  compared to a decrease of million or in fiscal year the ceramic based product decreased as dpac is longer investing in building this portion of the business as it relates to longer term sub contract business with the government 
additionally  the other product lines have decreased emphasis as the new wireless product was being developed and marketed 
royalty revenues increased by during fiscal year  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal export sales represented of total revenue for fiscal year as compared to of revenue for fiscal year  as a significant european customer decreased sales volume in fy sales of the wireless products were approximately  in fiscal year there were no sales of wireless product in the previous fiscal years 
cost of sales cost of sales for fiscal year was  or of sales  as compared to  or for fiscal year the increase in cost of sales as a percentage of revenue is due to the following factors reduction in carrying value of production equipment during the fiscal year  certain excess equipment was sold and an analysis of future cash flows from the industrial  defense and aerospace business as well as the lp stacking business was performed 
based on the changes in those markets  we reduced the carrying value of the production equipment by  to recognize the loss on assets sold and reduce the value of the remaining equipment to estimated fair value 
this expense is included in cost of sales for the fiscal year ended february  additionally  commencing in fiscal year  we will depreciate the balance of the lp stacking equipment over a twelve month period  to match the estimated life remaining with this technology 
percentage of business related to memory stacking this relates to the increased percentage of revenues from commercial products for which we purchased the memory components 
the cost of purchased memory is passed through to the customer  but does not contain a significant profit element 
thus  while there is not an impact on total margin  the gross margin percent is impacted by purchased memory content 
for fiscal year  approximately  of overall revenue of commercial orders contained procured memory as compared to  of overall revenue for fiscal year the balance of the commercial orders had consigned memory associated with the sale 
factory overhead included in cost of sales included in cost of sales are the factory overhead factors such as rent  utilities and factory supervisors 
as the revenue decreases  the fixed factory costs do not decrease significantly 
therefore as a percentage of sales  this factory overhead will increase as a percentage of sales 
decrease in average selling price additionally  margins were negatively impacted by the decrease in average selling prices discussed above 
we anticipate that average sales prices will continue to decline in fiscal year as new technology replaces our lp stack product and legacy product lines 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative sg a expenses decreased by  or in fiscal year to  from  in fiscal year sg a expense  as a percentage of net sales was approximately in fiscal year as compared to in fiscal year principally attributable to the decrease in net sales 
the decrease in dollar amount is primarily attributed to the following expenses as compared to the same accounts for the previous fiscal year acquisition search costs during fiscal year  dpac incurred acquisition search costs of  during fiscal year  there were no significant costs associated with acquisition search costs 
general and administrative payroll and bonuses during the second half of fiscal year  bonuses were ceased and reduced salaries were implemented for senior executives 
this resulted in a reduction in expense of approximately  from the previous year expense 
sales and marketing payroll expense during fiscal year  sales and marketing payroll decreased by approximately  this was due to a maturing market for the stacking business and the wireless product line still being in the development stage and not yet into the sales cycle 
the sales efforts for the lp stacking product line were reduced  as well as commission expense during the fiscal year 
additionally  due to the reduction of sales of the stacking product  bonuses were significantly reduced during the fiscal year 
towards the end of the fiscal year  efforts increased to hire additional personnel to market and sell the wireless product line 
investor relations expense during fiscal year  we brought the investor relations function in house and absorbed the responsibilities with existing employees 
this resulted in a reduction in investor relations expense of approximately  as compared to the previous fiscal year 
rent expense during the second quarter of fiscal year  the lease in the laguna hills expired  resulting in a reduction of rent expense from the previous year of approximately  litigation expense during fiscal year  the company s litigation expense increased by approximately  which includes the settlement  as compared to the costs incurred in fiscal year the company settled its patent litigation during fiscal year  and will not incur additional legal costs associated with that litigation 
the company filed suit against the equipment manufacturer of the durastack during the fiscal fourth quarter and will incur legal fees during fiscal year associated with this suit 
other changes in sg a expenses other sg a expenses increased  over the prior year principally associated with increased insurance premiums 
research and development expense research and development expense was  or of net sales  in fiscal year and  or of net sales in fiscal year this represents an increase of  or in fiscal year from fiscal year the investment in research and development is primarily due to the efforts associated with the new wireless product lines and the increased use of personnel to develop the new technology 
our initial wireless product was released in september our research and development efforts for fiscal year will focus on developing new wireless and related products 
restructuring and impairment charges these expenses relate to the following items severance expense during fiscal year  the contract with the ceo of dpac was terminated 
the severance expense related to this event was  of which  related to the acceleration of stock options  which was expensed in the fourth quarter of fiscal year this severance will be paid over the next months 
additionally  associated with a reduction of staff during the fiscal year  we incurred severance related costs of approximately  of which  related to accelerated stock option grants 
lease termination expense a charge of  was recorded relating to the cancellation of a lease entered into for a new facility in costa mesa  that the company terminated prior to occupying in fiscal due to the downsizing of its operations 
provision for impairment of durastack equipment during fiscal year  dpac incurred  in an asset impairment charge relating to the write off of the durastack equipment  which was planned to produce a new product by the company 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company was notified by the equipment vendor that the durastack automated production equipment would not meet the requirements of the volume through put and yield 
on march   the company announced that it had ceased development of the durastack product because the cost and time required to attain the yield and throughput targets made the continued development effort uneconomical 
as part of the impairment write off  during the fourth fiscal quarter  dpac recognized  relating to the durastack production equipment and related assets 
no salvage value was recognized as part of the write off 
see note of the notes to financial statements for additional discussion of our restructuring and impairment changes 
interest income and expense overall  net interest income decreased by  or from the previous fiscal year 
individually  interest expense decreased  or from  in fiscal year to  in fiscal year  due to the reduction of long term debt during the fiscal year 
interest income decreased by  or from  in fiscal year to  in fiscal year  due to the decline in interest rates that we were able to earn on our short term investments as well as a reduction in the cash balance that is eligible to earn interest 
income tax provision the company recognized deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying values and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
the company exercises significant judgment relating to the projection of future taxable income to determine the recoverability of any tax assets recorded on the balance sheet 
dpac regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability and establishes a valuation allowance based on historical taxable income  projected future taxable income  and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
to the extent that recovery is not believed to be more likely than not  a valuation allowance is established 
during the fiscal year  the company established a full valuation allowance for its net deferred tax assets  resulting in a charge to fiscal earnings of million 
in fiscal year  the company reversed a valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets totaling  based on the nature of the underlying deferred tax assets  the reversal of the valuation allowance resulted in an increase to additional paid in capital of  a reduction of goodwill in the amount of  and a net income tax benefit of  the valuation allowance was calculated in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas  which requires an assessment of both negative and positive evidence when measuring the need for a valuation allowance 
evidence evaluated by management included operating results during the most recent three year period and future projections  with more weight given to historical results than expectations of future profitability  which are inherently uncertain 
the company s net losses incurred since the quarter ended november  represented sufficient negative evidence to require a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets under sfas this valuation allowance will be evaluated periodically and could be reversed partially or totally if business results have sufficiently improved to support realization of our deferred tax assets 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year fiscal year net sales of  increased by  or from fiscal year net sales of  the increase in net sales was primarily due to a change in product mix toward a greater percentage of commercial stacking revenue that contained purchased memory and a lesser percentage containing memory supplied by our customers 
stacking revenues containing purchased memory  or memory stacking  involves dpac purchasing memory chips  stacking them  and then selling the stacked product to the customer 
in these cases where the costs of memory chips are included in the sales price of products  the company will purchase material for the commercial order concurrently with finalizing the sales price thereof  in order to avoid any price volatility in the components 
revenues from memory stacking may vary significantly from period to period based not only on quantities shipped but also on the current market price of purchased memory 
the balance of commercial stacking revenues is from service stacking  where customers provide us with consigned memory chips and we provide services to configure and stack the memory to customer specifications 
as there is no memory chip component cost to service stacking  revenues per unit are significantly lower than revenues per unit of memory stacking sales 
of total revenue in fiscal year  approximately related to memory stacking and to service stacking  as compared with and  respectively  in fiscal year this increase was caused by a change in customer mix  where a higher percentage of our sales were to customers using purchased memory 
the unit quantity of commercial stacks shipped during the year increased by over the previous fiscal year  offset by a decrease in the average selling price of approximately for commercial stacking services 
exclusive of memory content  this resulted in a net decrease in commercial stacking revenues of  or in fiscal year over fiscal year royalty revenues decreased by  during fiscal year export sales represented of total revenue for fiscal year as compared to of revenue for fiscal year  as a european customer established during fy increased sales volume in fy cost of sales for fiscal year was  or of sales  as compared to  or for fiscal year the increase in cost of sales percent is directly related to the increased percentage of revenues from commercial products for which we purchased the memory components 
the cost of purchased memory is passed through to the customer  but does not contain a significant profit element 
thus  while there is not an impact on total margin  the gross margin percent is impacted by purchased memory content 
for fiscal year  approximately  of commercial orders contained procured memory as compared to  for fiscal year the balance of the commercial orders had consigned memory associated with the sale 
additionally  margins were negatively impacted by the decrease in average selling prices discussed above 
we anticipate that average sales prices will continue to decline in fiscal year selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased by  or in fiscal year to  from  in fiscal year sg a expense  as a percentage of net sales was approximately in both fiscal years 
the increase in dollar amount is primarily attributed to incurred acquisition search costs of  and increased levels of compensation related expenses of  for fiscal year the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 
on march  as a result  the company has ceased amortization of goodwill  reducing annual amortization expense by  amortization of goodwill was in fiscal year and  in fiscal year see new issued accounting pronouncements 
research and development expense was  or of net sales  in fiscal year and  or of net sales in fiscal year this represents an increase of  or in fiscal year from fiscal year the continued investment in research and development is primarily due to continued efforts to allocate resources to the development and production of unique new technologies 
the company is continuing to invest in research and development for new products in the advanced technology marketplace 
see forward looking statements 
interest expense decreased  or from  in fiscal year to  in fiscal year  due to the reduced balances of capital leases outstanding during the year 
interest income decreased by  or from  in fiscal year to  in fiscal year  due to the decline in interest rates that we were able to earn on our short term investments 
in fiscal year  the company reversed a valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets totaling  based on the nature of the underlying deferred tax assets  the reversal of the valuation allowance resulted in an increase to additional paid in capital of  a reduction of goodwill in the amount of  and a net income tax benefit of  the reversal is the result of the company s history of operating profitability and the determination by management that the future realization of the net deferred tax assets was judged to be more likely than not 
the company exercises significant judgment relating to the projection of future taxable income to determine the recoverability of any tax assets recorded on the balance sheet 
if judgments regarding recoverability of deferred tax assets are not accurate  the company could be required to record additional reserves against deferred tax assets in future periods 
the company had an income tax provision of  in fiscal year liquidity and capital resources our primary source of liquidity during the current year ended february  was cash on hand which was generated from prior years operations 
liquidity in the prior fiscal years came primarily from operations 
cash provided used by operating activities was   and  in fiscal years  and  respectively 
the fiscal year net loss was partially offset by non cash charges totaling  and net changes in operating assets and liabilities totaling  fiscal years and substantially consisted of net income and depreciation and amortization  partially offset by net changes in operating assets and liabilities of  and  respectively 
cash used in investing activities was   and  in fiscal years  and  respectively 
cash payments related to the pep acquisition consisted of a  payment in fiscal year cash used for the purchase of manufacturing and test equipment  computers and tooling was   and  for fiscal years  and  respectively 
we do not have any material commitments or plans for significant capital expenditures in the fiscal year ending february  on may   dpac technologies reached an agreement with twilight technologies corp  a california corporation  to sell dpac s industrial  defense and aerospace ida memory product line 
the agreement sold the rights to the license the technology  and the purchased of the product line  inventory and certain assets for  in cash  as well as a future additional consideration based on the revenues of the product line for the next two years 
the amount of the additional consideration cannot yet be determined net cash used in financing activities was   and  in fiscal years  and  respectively 
the primary uses of funds for financing activities consist of principal payments on long term debt of   and  in fiscal years  and  respectively 
the primary sources of funds from financing activities are proceeds from the issuance of common stock associated with the exercise of stock options of   and  in fiscal years  and  respectively 
as of february   our future commitments under capital leases through fiscal year were  as of april   we were in compliance with the covenants  terms and conditions of our leases and debt instruments 
additionally  we have an available credit facility with a financial institution  for up to three million dollars  based on eligible accounts receivable 
there is a one million non accountable draw provision in the credit facility 
the credit facility bears interest at the bank s prime plus at february  and expires in august the company must also meet certain financial ratios  which we were in compliance with at february  there were no amounts outstanding under this credit facility as of february  and the company did not utilize the facility in fiscal year the company is currently evaluating the need for a credit facility after august there can be no assurance that another credit facility would be available to the company 
we ended fiscal year with a cash balance of  working capital of  and a current ratio of to this compares to a cash balance of  working capital of  and a current ratio of to at the end of fiscal year on may   the company completed a private placement of common stock of million  which will net the company approximately million 
along with this  dpac will issue approximately million shares of common stock to the investors  along with three warrants 
the series a warrants expire in five years and are for approximately million additional shares of common stock to the investors at per share 
the series b warrants expire in days from the effective registration date and are for approximately million additional shares of common stock to the investors at 
per share 
the placement agent will receive warrants that will expire in five years and are for approximately  additional shares at per share 
the warrants are callable under certain conditions 
management believes that the cash position and the net proceeds of the common stock offering  together with the proceeds of the sale of the industrial  defense and aerospace product line  should be sufficient to implement management s plan to transition the company s primary source of revenue from memory stacking to new wireless products 
management believes that the above plans will meet our cash needs for at least the next twelve months 
the actual amount and timing of working capital and capital expenditures that we may incur in future periods may vary significantly and will depend upon numerous factors  including the amount and timing of the receipt of revenues from operations  any potential acquisitions or divestitures  an increase in manufacturing capabilities  the timing and extent of the introduction of new products and services and growth in personnel and operations 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available when needed on terms favorable to the company  if at all 
if internally generated funds are inadequate  we may scale back expenditures or seek other financing  which might include sales of equity securities that could dilute existing shareholders

these include  but are not limited to  the factors described below which could cause actual results to differ from those contemplated by the forward looking statements 
product development and technological change the wireless and memory module industries are characterized by rapid technological change and are highly competitive with respect to timely product innovation 
our memory and wireless products are subject to obsolescence or price erosion because competitors are continuously introducing technologies with the same or greater capacity as our technology 
as a result  wireless products may have a product life of not more than one to three years 
our future success depends on our ability to develop new wireless products and product enhancements to keep up with technological advances and to meet customer needs 
any failure by us to anticipate or respond adequately to technological developments and customer requirements  or any significant delays in product development  firmware or software development  or introduction of wireless technologies could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  the company could incur additional operating costs with the introduction of new products 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in planned product development or marketing efforts  or that we will have adequate financial or technical resources for planned product development and promotion 
uncertainty of market acceptance or profitability of new products the introduction of new products  such as our product for the wireless marketplace  could require the expenditure of an unknown amount of funds for research and development  tooling  software development  manufacturing processes  inventory and marketing 
in order to successfully develop products  we will need to successfully anticipate market needs and may need to overcome rapid technological change and competition 
in order to achieve high volume production  we will need to out source production to third parties or enter into licensing arrangements and be successful in the management of sub contractors overseas 
we are inexperienced in the wireless industry  and our plans in that industry are unproven 
we have limited marketing capabilities and resources and are dependent upon internal sales and marketing personnel and a network of independent sales representatives for the marketing and sale of our products 
there can be no assurance that our products will achieve or maintain market acceptance  result in increased revenues  or be profitable 
parts shortages and over supplies and dependence on suppliers the electronics and components industry is characterized by periodic shortages or over supplies of parts that have in the past and may in the future negatively affect our operations 
we are dependent on a limited number of suppliers for wireless and semiconductor devices used in our products  and we have no long term supply contracts with any of them 
due to the cyclical nature of these industries and competitive conditions  we  or our sub contractors  may experience difficulties in meeting our supply requirements in the future 
any inability to obtain adequate deliveries of parts  either due to the loss of a supplier or industry wide shortages  could delay shipments of our products  increase our cost of goods sold and have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
credit risks and dependence on major customers we will be granting credit to customers in a variety of commercial industries 
credit is extended based on an evaluation of the customer s financial condition and collateral is not required 
estimated credit losses are provided for in the financial statements 
prior years have had a substantially large customers as part of the accounts receivable balance 
during the year ended february   sales to two major customers accounted for and of net sales 
accounts receivable from these two customers account for of total net accounts receivable at february  during the year ended february   sales to two major customers accounted for  of net sales 
accounts receivable from these two customers accounted for of total accounts receivable at february  during the year ended february   of net sales were to three major customers 
accounts receivable from these customers accounted for of total net accounts receivable at february  our inability to collect receivables from any of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
the model for accounts receivable for wireless customers may change to a larger customer base and smaller average receivables 
although we have a significant customer  many of our receivables may come from smaller  higher risk development companies 
intellectual property rights our ability to compete effectively is dependent on our proprietary know how  technology and patent rights 
we hold us patents on certain aspects of our three dimensional stacking technology and have applied for additional patents in the wireless area 
there can be no assurance that our patent applications will be approved  that any issued patents will afford our products any competitive advantage or that any of our products will not be challenged or circumvented by third parties  or that patents issued to others will not adversely affect the sales  development or commercialization of our present or future products 
we are involved from time to time in claims and litigation over intellectual property rights  which may adversely affect our ability to manufacture and sell our products 
the electronics and the wireless industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights 
we believe that it may be necessary  from time to time  to initiate litigation against one or more third parties to preserve our intellectual property rights 
in addition  from time to time  we have received  and may continue to receive in the future  notices that claim we have infringed upon  misappropriated or misused other parties proprietary rights  which claims could result in litigation 
such litigation would likely result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel 
in the event of an adverse result in such litigation  we could be required to pay substantial damages  cease the manufacture  use and sale of certain products  expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology  discontinue the use of certain processes or obtain licenses to use the infringed technology 
such a license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
our failure to obtain a license or our failure to obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms could cause us to incur substantial costs and suspend manufacturing products using the infringed technology 
if we obtain a license  we would likely be required to make royalty payments for sales under the license 
such payments would increase our costs of revenues and reduce our gross profit 
in addition  any litigation  whether as plaintiff or as defendant  would likely result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel  whether or not such litigation is ultimately determined in our favor 
in addition  the results of any litigation are inherently uncertain 
management of growth or diversification successful expansion or diversification of the company s operations will depend on the ability to obtain new customers  to attract and retain skilled management and other personnel  to secure adequate sources of supply on commercially reasonable terms and to successfully manage new product introductions 
to manage growth or diversification effectively  we will have to continue to implement and improve our operational  financial and management information systems  procedures and controls 
as we expand or diversify  we may from time to time experience constraints that will adversely affect our ability to satisfy customer demand in a timely fashion 
failure to manage growth or diversification effectively could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
competition there are companies that offer or are in the process of developing similar type of wireless product  including lantronix  digi international and others 
there are several companies that offer three dimensional products  including chippac  simpletech  staktek  samsung  infineon  elpedida and others 
some of such companies have greater financial  manufacturing and marketing capabilities than we have 
we could also experience competition from established and emerging network companies 
there can be no assurance that our products will be competitive with existing or future products  or that we will be able to establish or maintain a profitable price structure for our products 
we expect to face competition from existing competitors and new and emerging companies that may enter our existing or future markets with similar or alternative products  which may be less costly or provide additional features 
in addition  some of our significant suppliers are also our competitors  many of whom have the ability to manufacture competitive products at lower costs as a result of their higher levels of integration 
we also face competition from current and prospective customers that evaluate our capabilities against the merits of manufacturing products internally 
competition may arise due to the development of cooperative relationships among our current and potential competitors or third parties to increase the ability of their products to address the needs of our prospective customers 
accordingly  it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors will emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 
we expect our competitors will continue to improve the performance of their current products  reduce their prices and introduce new products that may offer greater performance and improved pricing  any of which could cause a decline in sales or loss of market acceptance of our products 
in addition  our competitors may develop enhancements to or future generations of competitive products that may render our technology or products obsolete or uncompetitive 
product liability in the course of our business  we may be subject to claims for product liability for which our insurance coverage is excluded or inadequate 
variability of gross margin gross profit as a percentage of sales was for fiscal year ended february  as compared to for the fiscal year ended february   and for the fiscal year ended february  any change in the gross margins can typically be attributed to the type of products  and the amount of purchased memory included in sales during the year as well as the amount of royalty income generated during the periods 
as we market our products the product mix may be different and result in changes in the gross margin 
we expect that our net sales and gross margin may vary significantly based on these and other factors  including the mix of products sold and the manufacturing services provided  the channels through which our products are sold  changes in product selling prices and component costs  the level of manufacturing efficiencies achieved and pricing by competitors 
the selling prices of our products may decline depending upon the price changes of our cost of sales  which would have a material adverse effect on our net sales and could  have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operation 
accordingly  our ability to maintain or increase net sales will be highly dependent upon our ability to increase unit sales volumes of existing products and to introduce and sell new products in quantities sufficient to compensate for the anticipated declines in selling prices 
declining product selling prices may also materially and adversely affect our gross margin unless we are able to reduce our cost per unit to offset declines in product selling prices 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to increase unit sales volumes  introduce and sell new products or reduce our cost per unit 
we also expect that our business may experience significant seasonality to the extent it sells a material portion of our products in europe due to vacation cycles and to the extent  our exposure to the personal computer market remains significant 
our average sales prices have historically declined  and we anticipate that the average sales prices for our products will continue to decline and could negatively impact our gross profit margins 
decline of demand for product due to downturn of related industries we may experience substantial period to period fluctuations in operating results due to factors affecting the wireless  computer  telecommunications and networking industries 
from time to time  each of these industries has experienced downturns  often in connection with  or in anticipation of  declines in general economic conditions 
a decline or significant shortfall in growth in any one of these industries or a technology shift  could have a material adverse impact on the demand for our products  and therefore  a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that our net sales and results of operations will not be materially and adversely affected in the future due to changes in demand from individual customers or cyclical changes in the wireless  computer  telecommunications  networking or other industries utilizing our products 
international sales in fiscal year  approximately of our sales were export sales  primarily to western europe as compared to in fiscal and in fiscal year foreign sales are made in us dollars 
the increase was primarily due to the addition of a significant new international customer in fiscal year and can change from year to year 
international sales may be subject to certain risks  including changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other barriers  timing and availability of export licenses  political and economic instability  difficulties in accounts receivable collections  natural disasters  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign subsidiary and branch operations  difficulties in managing distributors  difficulties in obtaining governmental approvals for telecommunications and other products  foreign currency exchange fluctuations  the burden of complying with a wide variety of complex foreign laws and treaties  potentially adverse tax consequences and uncertainties relative to regional  political and economic circumstances 
moreover and as a result of currency changes and other factors  certain of our competitors may have the ability to manufacture competitive products in asia at lower costs than we can manufacture them 
we are also subject to the risks associated with the imposition of legislation and regulations relating to the import or export of high technology products 
we cannot predict whether the united states or other countries will implement quotas  duties  taxes or other charges or restrictions upon the importation or exportation of our products 
because sales of our products have been denominated to date in united states dollars  increases in the value of the united states dollar could increase the price of our products so that they become relatively more expensive to customers in the local currency of a particular country  leading to a reduction in sales and profitability in that country 
future international activity may result in increased foreign currency denominated sales 
gains and losses on the conversion to united states dollars of accounts receivable  accounts payable and other monetary assets and liabilities arising from international operations may contribute to fluctuations in our results of operations 
some of our customer s purchase orders and agreements are governed by foreign laws  which may differ significantly from united states laws 
therefore  we may be limited in our ability to enforce any rights under such agreements and to collect damages  if awarded 
these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
limited experience in acquisitions we may pursue selective acquisitions to complement our internal growth 
if we make any future acquisitions  we could issue stock that would dilute our shareholders percentage ownership  incur substantial debt  assume contingent liabilities  or use other company assets available at the time of acquisition 
we have limited experience in acquiring other businesses  product lines and technologies 
in addition  the attention of our small management team may be diverted from our core business if we undertake an acquisition 
potential acquisitions also involve numerous risks  including  among others problems assimilating the purchased operations  technologies or products  costs associated with the acquisition  adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers  sudden market changes  risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience  potential loss of key employees of purchased organizations  and potential litigation arising from the acquired company s operations before the acquisition 
our inability to overcome problems encountered in connection with such acquisitions could divert the attention of management  utilize scarce corporate resources and harm our business 
in addition  we are unable to predict whether or when any prospective acquisition candidate will become available or the likelihood that any acquisition will be completed 
cyclical nature of wireless and electronics industries the wireless and the electronics industry  is highly cyclical and is characterized by constant and rapid technological change  rapid product obsolescence and price erosion  evolving standards  short product life cycles and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand 
the industry has experienced significant downturns  often connected with  or in anticipation of  maturing product cycles of both the producing companies and their customers products and declines in general economic conditions 
these downturns have been characterized by diminished product demand  production overcapacity  high inventory levels and accelerated erosion of average selling prices 
any future downturns could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
furthermore  any upturn in these industries could result in increased demand for  and possible shortages of  components we use to manufacture and assemble our products 
such shortages could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
product returns and order cancellation to the extent  we manufacture products in anticipation of future demand that does not materialize  or in the event a customer cancels outstanding orders  we could experience an unanticipated increase in our inventory 
in addition  while we may not be contractually obligated to accept returned products  and have typically not done so in the past  we may determine that it is in our best interest to accept returns in order to maintain good relations with our customers 
product returns would increase our inventory and reduce our revenues 
we have had to write down inventory in the past for reasons such as obsolescence  excess quantities and declines in market value below our costs 
we have no long term volume commitments from our customers that are not subject to cancellation by the customer 
sales of our products are made through individual purchase orders and  in certain cases  are made under master agreements governing the terms and conditions of the relationships 
customers may change  cancel or delay orders with limited or no penalties 
we have experienced cancellations of orders and fluctuations in order levels from period to period and we expect to continue to experience similar cancellations and fluctuations in the future that could result in fluctuations in our revenues 
additional capital funding to impair value of investment if we expand more rapidly than currently anticipated or if our working capital needs exceed our current expectations  we may need to raise additional capital through public or private equity offerings or debt financings 
our future capital requirements depend on many factors including our research  development  sales and marketing activities 
we do not know whether additional financing will be available when needed  or will be available on terms favorable to us 
if we cannot raise needed funds on acceptable terms  we may not be able to develop or enhance our products  take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements 
to the extent  we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities  our shareholders may experience substantial dilution and the new equity securities may have greater rights  preferences or privileges than our existing common stock 
geographic concentration of operation for the wireless products none of our manufacturing operations are located in our facility in garden grove  california 
our wireless product line is manufactured overseas in korea  with some contract manufacturing conducted locally 
due to the geographic concentration  a disruption of the manufacturing operations  resulting from sustained process abnormalities  human error  government intervention or natural disasters such as earthquakes  fires or floods could cause us to cease or limit our sub contractors operations and consequently harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
compliance with environmental laws and regulations we are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations governing  among other things  air emissions  waste water discharge  waste storage  treatment and disposal  and remediation of releases of hazardous materials 
our failure to comply with present and future requirements could harm our ability to continue manufacturing our products 
such requirements could require us to acquire costly equipment or to incur other significant expenses to comply with environmental regulations 
the imposition of additional or more stringent environmental requirements  the results of future testing at our facilities  or a determination that we are potentially responsible for remediation at other sites where problems are not presently known to us  could result in expenses in excess of amounts currently estimated to be required for such matters 
key personnel the company may fail to attract or retain the qualified technical sales  marketing and managerial personnel required to operate its business successfully 
dpac s future success depends  in part  upon ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical  sales  marketing and managerial personnel 
personnel with the necessary expertise are scarce and competition for personnel with proper skills is intense 
also  attrition in personnel can result from  among other things  changes related to acquisitions  as well as retirement or disability 
the company may not be able to retain existing key technical  sales  marketing and managerial employees or be successful in attracting  assimilating or retaining other highly qualified technical  sales  marketing and managerial personnel in the future 
if the company is unable to retain existing key employees or is unsuccessful in attracting new highly qualified employees  business  financial condition and results of operations of dpac could be materially and adversely affected 
stock price volatility the stock market in general  and the market for shares of technology companies in particular  has experienced extreme price fluctuations 
these price fluctuations are often unrelated to the operating performance of the affected companies 
many technology companies  including us  have experienced dramatic volatility in the market prices of their common stock 
if our future operating results are below the expectations of stock market analysts and investors  our stock price may decline 
we cannot be certain that the market price of our common stock will remain stable in the future 
our stock price may undergo fluctuations that are material  adverse and unrelated to our performance other contingent contractual obligations during its normal course of business  the company has made certain indemnities  commitments and guarantees under which it may be required to make payments in relation to certain transactions 
these include indemnities to various lessors in connection with facility leases for certain claims arising from such facility or lease  indemnities to vendors and service providers pertaining to claims based on the negligence or willful misconduct of the company  and indemnities involving the accuracy of representations and warranties in certain contracts 
the company may also issue a guarantee in the form of a standby letter of credit as security for contingent liabilities under certain customer contracts 
the duration of these indemnities  commitments and guarantees varies and  in certain cases  may be indefinite 
the majority of these indemnities  commitments and guarantees may not provide for any limitation of the maximum potential for future payments the company could be obligated to make 
the company has not recorded any liability for these indemnities  commitments and guarantees in the accompanying balance sheets 
product warranty costs are not significant 
on december   the company terminated the contract of its ceo 
pursuant to an employment agreement  the former ceo will be entitled to salary and benefits totaling approximately  through june the company recorded a charge in the fourth quarter associated with the severance benefits 
approximately  of the charge will relate to the acceleration of stock options 
the remaining benefits will be paid ratably through june two other executive officers at dpac also have similar employment agreements with severance packages of months 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company invests excess cash in money market funds  held primarily in one financial institution 
money market funds do not have maturity dates and do not present a significant market risk 
for fiscal year  interest expense was not sensitive to the general level of the us interest rates because our debt instruments  consisting principally of capital lease agreements  were based on fixed interest rates 
the company s export sales are denominated in us dollars
