item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  overview general the company has two reportable operating segments its traditional business which manufactures and sells precured tread rubber  equipment and supplies for retreading tires and tire distribution systems  inc tds which sells and maintains retread tires and new tires to principally commercial and industrial customers 
bandag and its licensees have  franchise locations worldwide  with located in the united states and internationally 
the majority of bandag s franchisees are independent operators of full service tire distributorships and the remaining are owned by tds 
the traditional business revenues primarily come from the sale of retread material and equipment to its franchisees 
tds offers complete tire management services including the complete line of bandag retreads  new tires commercial  retail and off the road  alignment and hour road service 
approximately of bandag s retread material sales in north america come from national account contracts with a variety of major fleets 
the depth of the company s franchisee network combined with the quality of its products has allowed bandag to build a significant national account business 
significant fleet revenue is important to bandag s franchisees who act with bandag as subcontractors to deliver products  information and services to national fleet customers 
bandag s franchise agreements require its franchisees to buy their precured retreading material and equipment from bandag  which gives bandag a secure revenue stream 
growth in revenue can be achieved by expanding the amount of services that can be provided to a fleet by bandag and its franchisees while continuing to provide value added retread products 
bandag also generates significant cash flow which has historically been used to reinvest in the business  make debt payments  pay dividends  repurchase stock and other corporate purposes 
on february   the company announced the acquisition of an majority interest in speedco  inc from its founders and equilon enterprises  llc  a royal dutch shell group company 
speedco provides quick service truck lubrication nationwide through company owned and six licensed on highway locations 
in total  bandag paid approximately  for its interest and to assume and retire  of debt 
speedco generated unaudited revenues of approximately  and unaudited pre tax income of approximately  in bandag expects diluted earnings per share to improve between and in due to this acquisition 
trucking industry while shippers apply pressure to fleets from the service side  pressure on fleets from the cost side continues to intensify 
high insurance costs  increased driver wages and higher fuel costs continue to increase the pressure on fleets to find ways to reduce costs 
also  on august   the federal motor carrier safety administration filed a final rule for hours of service of drivers  applying to all commercial motor vehicles and mandating how long drivers can drive  be on duty  rest  etc 
among other things  the new rule lengthens the allowable driving time from hours to hours and limits total daily time on duty which includes loading  unloading  breaks and breakdown time to hours 
this new regulation went into effect january  the pressure to reduce costs and still meet shipper demands requires fleets to focus on increasing revenue through better asset utilization 
fleets are looking for ways to reduce costs and to reduce the assets that are used to generate revenues 
they are focusing  not just on reduction of downtime  but on better utilization of downtime that is mandated through regulation eg when the truck is down due to regulated drive rest time  fleets will seek to use that time for vehicle maintenance 
fleets  particularly truckload carriers  will likely focus more on preventive maintenance and other services and products  such as those provided by bandag that can provide more reliable utilization of their assets 
on december   yellow corporation acquired roadway corporation  forming yellow roadway corporation 
the company currently has an outsourcing agreement with roadway corporation that was extended to july and is in negotiations with yellow roadway corporation to enter into a new agreement 
if yellow roadway corporation were to allow the contract to expire  the effect on the company could be materially adverse to net sales and net income 
the company currently has tire and wheel assets of approximately  recorded in connection with this contract 
upon termination of the agreement  the tire and wheel assets will either be repurchased by roadway corporation or a third party at a contractually agreed upon price  which the company believes will approximate their carrying value  or will remain the property of the company 
for further information see outsourcing agreement in critical accounting policies below 
new tire retread pricing and profitability the relationship between new tire pricing and retread unit pricing has been narrowing primarily due to retread unit prices increasing at a faster rate than new tires and lower priced imported new tires entering the market 
generally  a decreasing new tire to retread price ratio will put downward pressure on retread pricing and tend to increase the use of relatively less expensive new tires instead of retreads 
increases in imports of low priced new tires and the movement of major new tire manufactures to lower their costs by utilizing overseas production has exacerbated this situation 
however  there still remains an inherent value in retreading to fleets that recognize the need for a well managed tire program that combines quality new tires  retreads and tire management services to reduce operating costs 
sale of tds locations bandag s tds subsidiary sold or closed locations during and locations during the company considers tds to be essential in order to protect bandag s distribution where no independent bandag franchise exists 
bandag will continue to divest tds locations where an independent bandag dealer is willing to buy the location and when it is a sensible decision for the company to sell 
bandag will also continue to purchase locations for tds if it is necessary to maintain bandag s distribution in an area 
in currently unprofitable locations where tds must operate to maintain bandag s presence to serve its fleet customers  the company intends to develop and implement operational plans to achieve profitability

north america sells to independent dealers as well as to tds and other subsidiaries 
sales to tds and other subsidiaries are eliminated in consolidation 
accordingly  as tds locations are divested and become unaffiliated bandag customers  sales to independent dealers should benefit 
the table below depicts the breakout of north america s retread product sales between tds and independent dealers in thousands year ended december  retread product sales increase decrease sales to independent dealers   sales to tds   total retread product sales   the increase in retread product sales to independent dealers is due to several factors including a increased sales to independent dealers that purchased tds locations  b the effect of translating canadian dollar denominated sales to us dollars of  and c the impact of a january  price increase 
these factors were partially offset by a decrease in volume 
the decrease in retread product sales to tds is primarily due to the divestitures and closures of tds locations 
north america s tread rubber orders reflected the impact of north american dealers buying ahead of the january price increase 
a portion of those orders were shipped in first quarter as a result  north american sales backlog at year end was approximately  below the previous year level

net sales consolidated net sales in decreased  or  from this included a decrease of  or  in the traditional business 
the decrease in traditional business net sales primarily resulted from a decline in retread material unit volume  a decrease in equipment sales from and an increase of approximately  related to dealer marketing programs classified as a reduction of sales 
in addition  traditional business revenues were approximately lower due to the lower translated value of the company s foreign currency denominated sales  particularly the brazilian real and south african rand 
tds sales decreased  or  from  primarily as a result of the negative impact of the declining economy and the loss of several significant customers  most notably the bankruptcy of consolidated freightways 
the company s seasonal sales pattern is tied to the overall performance of the economy and to the level of trucking activity 
gross profit margins consolidated gross profit margin for increased by percentage points from gross profit margin for the traditional business which includes sales to tds and tds increased by and percentage points  respectively  from consolidated and traditional business gross profit margins were positively impacted by  due to decreased lifo inventory levels  which was partially offset by restructuring charges in europe of  operating and other expenses consolidated operating and other expenses decreased  or  from excluding the effects of  of goodwill amortization in  consolidated operating and other expenses decreased  or  from traditional business operating and other expenses in decreased  or  from the decrease in consolidated operating and other expenses primarily resulted from decreased litigation expenses  which were significantly offset by lower pension income   in expense related to converting systembandag users to the roadware software system and  related to impairment charges recorded against the carrying value of the company s joint venture in india  and operations in brazil and venezuela

traditional business north america sales of  of retread products to tds accounted for of north america s total retread products sold in  compared to  or in total retread products sold in north america in were  or below sales 
retread product sales to tds declined in compared to  while sales of retread products to independent dealers increased 
the increase in retread product sales to independent dealers is primarily due to a increase in retread material unit volume 
equipment sales to independent dealers in  which totaled  decreased as compared to  and equipment sales to tds in  which totaled  decreased as compared to equipment sales typically vary depending on the signing of new franchisees and new product innovations 
north american other net sales increased  or  in as compared to  primarily as a result of the acquisition of open road technologies 
total north america net sales increased  or  in as compared to a decrease in average raw material costs  coupled with a decrease in depreciation expense  decreased lifo inventory levels and a decrease in equipment sales  which carry lower gross margins than retread products  and increased production efficiency in the united states and canada  primarily resulted in a and percentage point increase in north america s gross margin for on sales to independent dealers and total sales  respectively  as compared to north american operating expenses in were  or higher than  expenses primarily due to lower pension income and approximately  in expense related to converting systembandag users to the roadware software system 
higher sales and gross profit was partially offset by higher operating and other expenses  resulting in an increase of  or in earnings before income taxes and cumulative effect of accounting change in  as compared to europe net sales in europe declined  or  from  primarily due to a retread material unit volume decrease of 
gross profit margin decreased percentage points from primarily due to approximately  of restructuring charges recorded in  partially offset by  of reduced cost of sales due to decreased lifo inventory levels

the spread between the net sales decrease and the retread material unit volume decrease is primarily due to the lower translated value of the brazilian real and south african rand 
gross profit margin increased percentage points from operating and other expenses decreased  or  from operating and other expenses were positively impacted by net foreign exchange gains and the lower translated value of the brazilian real and south african rand  and negatively impacted by the  impairment charge recorded against the carrying value of the company s joint venture in india and operations in brazil and venezuela

primarily as a result of lower sales volume and higher operating expenses  tds recorded a loss before income taxes and cumulative effect of accounting change of  in  which compares to a loss before income taxes of  in  or a loss before income taxes of  excluding goodwill amortization 
impact of inflation and changing prices historically  it has generally been the company s practice to adjust its selling prices and sales allowances to reflect changes in production and raw material costs in order to maintain its gross profit margin 
to soften the impact of higher raw material costs caused by increases in oil prices the company adjusted selling prices in the united states and canada effective january  and adjusted selling prices in some foreign locations during the year 
the company may continue to adjust prices if raw material costs rise further  however  due to competitive pressure and the decreasing difference between the price on a bandag retread and a substitute new tire  the company believes its ability to continue to pass on such increases may be diminished 
the ability of the company to raise prices does not eliminate its exposure to pricing risks on its fleet contract business due to the terms of the agreements 
replacement of fixed assets requires a greater investment than the original asset cost due to the impact of general price level increases over the useful lives of plant and equipment 
this increased capital investment would result in higher depreciation charges affecting both inventories and cost of products sold 
financial condition liquidity and capital resources as of december   the company had cash and cash equivalents of  as compared to  at december  the company s ratio of total current assets to total current liabilities was to at december  with current assets exceeding current liabilities by  at december   the company had approximately  of assets held for sale  consisting primarily of inventory and property  plant and equipment classified as other current assets

the acquisition of of speedco  inc subsequent to year end was financed with available cash on hand 
refer to note of the consolidated financial statements for further details 
net cash provided by operating activities for the twelve months ended december  was  primarily due to net earnings and depreciation 
the only changes in working capital requirements are for normal business growth 
the company typically funds its capital expenditures from operating cash flows 
during  the company spent  for capital expenditures as compared to  in the company believes that spending in the current year is representative of future capital spending needs 
during  the company sold tds locations for cash proceeds of  the company invests excess funds over various terms  but only instruments with an original maturity date of over days are classified as investments for balance sheet purposes 
the company s maturities of investments exceeded purchases by  during  resulting in total investments of  at december  as of december   the company had available uncommitted and committed lines of credit totaling  in the united states for working capital purposes 
also  the company s foreign subsidiaries had approximately  in credit and overdraft facilities available to them 
from time to time during  the company borrowed funds to supplement operational cash flow needs or to settle intercompany transactions

the company generally funds its dividends and stock repurchases from the cash flow generated from its operations 
off balance sheet arrangements in conjunction with the divestiture of certain tds locations in  the company guaranteed a portion of third party loans to a dealer 
bandag s exposure under these guarantees is  the guarantees are secured by assets of the dealer 
the term of the guarantees is three years 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments following is a summary of the company s commitments as of december  in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total after long term debt     operating leases      purchase commitments   other obligations      total contractual obligations     total amount amount of commitments expiration per period other commercial commitments committed after standby letters of credit   other obligations consist primarily of a postretirement medical liability and miscellaneous other liabilities 
standby letters of credit are provided to the company s insurance administrators to cover costs associated with self insurance liabilities 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market resk financial risk management the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates  foreign exchange rates  and commodity prices 
to mitigate such risks  the company enters into various derivative transactions 
all derivative transactions are authorized and executed pursuant to clearly defined company policies and procedures  which strictly prohibit the use of financial instruments for trading purposes 
analytical techniques and selective derivative instruments are applied to manage and monitor such market exposures 
foreign currency exposure foreign currency exposures arising from cash flow transactions include firm commitments and anticipatory transactions 
translation exposure is also part of the overall foreign exchange risk 
the company s exposure to foreign currency risks exists primarily with the brazilian real  canadian dollar  mexican peso  japanese yen and european union euro 
the company regularly enters into foreign currency contracts primarily using foreign exchange forward contracts and options to manage the foreign currency risks associated with most of its firm commitment exposures 
the company also employs foreign exchange forward contracts as well as option contracts to manage the foreign currency risks associated with approximately of its anticipated future cash flow transactions within the coming twelve months 
the notional amount of these contracts at december  and were  and  respectively 
the company also limits its exposure to foreign currency fluctuations by entering into offsetting asset or liability positions and by establishing and monitoring limits on unmatched positions 
the company s pre tax earnings from foreign subsidiaries and affiliates translated into us dollars using a weighted average exchange rate was  and  for the years ending december  and  respectively 
on that basis  the potential loss in the value of the company s pre tax earnings from foreign subsidiaries resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates would have been  in and  in the company also has foreign currency exposure arising from the translation of the company s net equity investment in its foreign subsidiaries to us dollars 
the company generally views as long term its investments in foreign subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the us dollar 
the primary currencies to which the company is exposed are the european euro  brazilian real  mexican peso  canadian dollar and south african rand 
a change in foreign currency exchange rates from balance sheet date levels would have impacted the company s net foreign investments by  and  at december  and  respectively 
interest rate exposure in order to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in the general level of interest rates  the company generally maintains a large portion of its debt as fixed rate in nature by borrowing on a long term basis 
at december  and  the company had outstanding debt of  and  respectively 
at december  and  the fair value of the company s debt was  and  respectively 
in addition  at december  and  the fair value of securities held for investment was  and  respectively 
the fair value of the company s total long term debt and its securities held for investment would not be materially affected by a hypothetical adverse change in interest rates 
therefore  the effects of interest rate changes on the fair value of the company s financial instruments are limited 
securities held for investment primarily consist of obligations of states and political subdivisions of a short term nature 
commodities exposure due to the nature of its business  the company procures almost all of its synthetic rubber  which is the predominant raw material used in manufacturing tire tread  at quarterly fixed rates using contracts with the company s main suppliers 
historically  the company adjusts its selling prices and sales allowances to reflect significant changes in commodity costs  however  due to competitive pressures and the decreasing difference between the price on a bandag retread and a substitute new tire  the company believes its ability to continue to pass on such increases may be diminished 
to soften the impact of higher raw material costs caused by increases in oil prices the company adjusted selling prices in the united states and canada effective january  and adjusted selling prices in some foreign locations during the year 
therefore  the company s exposure is limited to the extent selling price adjustments fail to offset increases in commodity costs 
the ability of the company to raise prices does not eliminate its exposure to pricing risks on its fleet contract business due to the terms of the related agreements 
critical accounting policies bandag s financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies  which require management to make significant estimates and assumptions 
the company believes that the following are some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of the accounting policies that currently affect its financial condition and results of operations 
the company s senior management has discussed the development and selection of critical accounting estimates and related management s discussion and analysis disclosures with the audit committee of the board of directors 
accounts receivable bandag s global credit policies are corporately determined and managed through business unit credit and financial management departments to insure compliance with local laws and to effect proper credit and collections at the country level 
a significant percentage of the company s global accounts receivable are obligations of franchisees 
the majority of these accounts receivable are extended within north america 
however  bandag competes in the global marketplace and credit is extended outside of the united states 
bandag continuously monitors political  social and economic risks to insure sound credit decisions are made within these foreign markets 
bandag also extends credit in north america to customers in the trucking and transportation industry 
credit is extended to large national and regional customers on a contractual basis through bandag 
smaller regional and local trucking customers are provided credit through tds 
management evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where management is aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  a specific reserve for bad debts is recorded against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount management reasonably believes will be collected 
general reserves for bad debts are maintained based upon the length of time the receivables are past due and upon historical write off experience by geographic location 
credit losses have been within management s expectations 
income taxes the company utilizes the asset and liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recorded to reflect the future tax consequences of temporary timing differences between the tax and financial statement basis of assets and liabilities 
at december   the company had net deferred tax assets of  this balance consists of approximately  of net deferred tax assets primarily related to the timing of income and deductions for tax versus books  and  of net deferred tax liabilities primarily related to the unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries 
deferred taxes on the unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries are provided under the assumption that all profits of the foreign subsidiaries will be repatriated to the united states and all foreign taxes paid will be available to offset united states taxes 
in addition  any deferred tax asset is reviewed annually to determine the probability of realizing the asset 
if it is determined unlikely that the asset will be fully realized in the future  a valuation allowance is established against the asset 
refer to note of the consolidated financial statements for further details 
the company believes it has a reasonable basis in the tax law for all of the positions it takes on the various federal and state tax returns it files 
however  in recognition of the fact that various taxing authorities may not agree with the company s position on certain issues  that the cost of litigation in maintaining the positions that the company has taken on various issues might be significant  and that the taxing authorities may prevail in their attempts to overturn such possibilities  the company maintains tax reserves 
these reserves  the potential issues they are intended to cover  as well as their adequacy to do so  are reviewed both internally and with outside tax professionals on a regular and frequent basis 
periodic adjustments are made to such reserves to reflect the lapsing of statutes of limitations  closings of ongoing examinations or commencement of new examinations  and changes in tax law or interpretations of tax law 
marketing programs distribution management request dmr is a marketing program designed to increase company market share by enhancing dealer capability and franchise value 
enhanced dealer capabilities and franchise values are achieved primarily through company provided financial assistance towards the acquisition of equipment  service vehicles  facility expansions and other items aligned with company goals 
under the dmr program  the company provides financial assistance in the form of dmr promissory notes from the dealer to bandag 
the proceeds from the promissory notes can only be used by the dealer toward the acquisition of equipment including equipment sold by the company  service vehicles  facility expansions and other items aligned with company goals 
the notes have a term of up to five years 
however  if the dealer achieves a business objective  typically purchasing a specified amount of tread rubber each year  then the company forgives either part or all of the principal and interest for that year 
the company records a reduction in sales for the costs of the program as financial assistance is provided 
the dmr reserve at december   and was   and  respectively 
in  and  dmr costs of   and  respectively  were recorded as a reduction of sales 
outsourcing agreement in connection with a tire management outsourcing agreement entered into by tms  the company is providing tire management services to a customer  roadway corporation 
the current outsourcing agreement with roadway corporation was extended to july and the company is in negotiations with yellow roadway corporation to enter into a new agreement 
the substance of the outsourcing agreement  as more fully described below  is that the company provides complete maintenance of the customer s tire and wheel assets over the term of the agreement and provides a full range of services to maintain the assets 
these services include replacing and repairing tires and wheels  as well as other tire related services 
the company entered into this agreement because fleets were experiencing narrowing margins and expanding needs  including the need for suppliers such as the company to provide services  such as outsourcing services  as well as products 
the company recognizes revenue for these outsourcing services on a per mile basis based on the number of tire miles traveled by the customer s truck fleet in the month of usage 
over the term of the agreement  the company estimates that approximately of the revenue will be realized through cash payments and the balance will be realized by recording an incrementally increasing ownership percentage in the customer s tire assets 
the company agreed to accept the non cash consideration as partial payment for its services as a result of the negotiating process between the company and the customer  its longstanding relationship with the customer and the anticipated return on the contract  including the non cash consideration received 
the tire and wheel assets are classified as other assets 
in   and  these non current assets amounted to   and  respectively 
the company does not record depreciation on the tire and wheel assets  rather  the company incurs direct expenses related to the efforts of maintaining the tires at the mutually agreed upon specifications 
these amounts are expensed as incurred and approximate the amount that would otherwise be recorded as depreciation expense 
quarterly  the company evaluates the carrying value of the tire and wheel assets for impairment and adjusts the carrying value as required 
upon termination of the agreement  the tire and wheel assets will either be repurchased by the customer or a third party at a contractually agreed upon price  which the company believes will approximate their carrying value  or will remain the property of the company 
there could be a material difference between the carrying value and the realizable value should the tire and wheel assets not be repurchased by the customer  or a third party 
although the acquisition of roadway by yellow adds uncertainty  the company has determined the probability that the customer  or a third party  will not repurchase the tire and wheel assets to be highly unlikely based upon the facts and conditions surrounding the contract with this customer  which includes a significant termination penalty that the company believes is sufficient to make this option unfavorable to the customer 
pension plans the company accounts for its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis 
a substantial portion of the company s pension amounts relate to its defined benefit plans in the united states 
the company has not made any contributions to any of the united states pension plans since plan year because the fully funded status of the plans would preclude a tax deduction 
sfas no 
and the policies used by the company generally reduce the volatility of pension income or expense arising from changes in the pension liability discount rates and the performance of the pension plan s assets 
an important element in determining the company s pension income or expense in accordance with sfas no
