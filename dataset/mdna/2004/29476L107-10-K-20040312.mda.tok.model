capitalization of fixed assets and improvements to real estate our policy with respect to capital expenditures is generally to capitalize expenditures that improve the value of the property or extend the useful life of the component asset of the property 
we track improvements to real estate in two major categories and several subcategories replacements inside the unit 
these include carpets and hardwood floors  appliances  mechanical equipment such as individual furnace air units  hot water heaters  etc  furniture and fixtures such as kitchen bath cabinets  light fixtures  ceiling fans  sinks  tubs  toilets  mirrors  countertops  etc  flooring such as vinyl  linoleum or tile  and blinds shades 
all replacements are depreciated over a five year estimated useful life 
we expense as incurred all maintenance and turnover costs such as cleaning  interior painting of individual units and the repair of any replacement item noted above 
building improvements outside the unit 
these include roof replacement and major repairs  paving or major resurfacing of parking lots  curbs and sidewalks  amenities and common areas such as pools  exterior sports and playground equipment  lobbies  clubhouses  laundry rooms  alarm and security systems and offices  major building mechanical equipment systems  interior and exterior structural repair and exterior painting and siding  major landscaping and grounds improvement  and vehicles and office and maintenance equipment 
all building improvements are depreciated over a five to ten year estimated useful life 
we expense as incurred all recurring expenditures that do not improve the value of the asset or extend its useful life 
for the year ended december   our actual improvements to real estate totaled approximately million 
this includes the following detail amounts in thousands except for unit and per unit amounts capitalized improvements to real estate for the year ended december  total units replacements avg

the company expects to fund approximately million in total additions to non real estate property in improvements to real estate and additions to non real estate property were funded from net cash provided by operating activities 
derivative instruments in the normal course of business  the company is exposed to the effect of interest rate changes 
the company limits these risks by following established risk management policies and procedures including the use of derivatives to hedge interest rate risk on debt instruments 
the company has a policy of only entering into contracts with major financial institutions based upon their credit ratings and other factors 
when viewed in conjunction with the underlying and offsetting exposure that the derivatives are designed to hedge  the company has not sustained a material loss from those instruments nor does it anticipate any material adverse effect on its net income or financial position in the future from the use of derivatives 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of derivative instruments at december  other minority interests as of december  decreased by million when compared to december  the primary factors that impacted this account in the company s consolidated statements of operations and balance sheets during the year ended december  were distributions declared to minority interests  which amounted to million excluding junior preference unit and preference interest distributions  the allocation of income from operations to holders of op units in the amount of million  the issuance of  op units to various limited partners at an average price of per unit  the issuance of common shares  and the conversion of op units into common shares 
total distributions paid in january amounted to million excluding distributions on partially owned properties  which included certain distributions declared during the fourth quarter ended december  the company expects to meet its short term liquidity requirements  including capital expenditures related to maintaining its existing properties and certain scheduled unsecured note and mortgage note repayments  generally through its working capital  net cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under its line of credit 
the company considers its cash provided by operating activities to be adequate to meet operating requirements and payments of distributions 
the company also expects to meet its long term liquidity requirements  such as scheduled unsecured note and mortgage debt maturities  property acquisitions  financing of construction and development activities and capital improvements through the issuance of unsecured notes and equity securities  including additional op units  and proceeds received from the disposition of certain properties 
in addition  the company has significant unencumbered properties available to secure additional mortgage borrowings in the event that the public capital markets are unavailable or the cost of alternative sources of capital is too high 
the fair value of and cash flow from these unencumbered properties are in excess of the requirements the company must maintain in order to comply with covenants under its unsecured notes and line of credit 
the company has a revolving credit facility with potential borrowings of up to million 
this facility matures in may and may  among other potential uses  be used to fund property acquisitions  costs for certain properties under development and short term liquidity requirements 
as of march   million was outstanding under this facility and was restricted and dedicated to support letters of credit 
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations the company has co invested in various properties that are unconsolidated and accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
management does not believe these investments have a materially different impact upon the company s liquidity  capital resources  credit or market risk than its property management and ownership activities generally  except to the extent the development ventures mitigate risk by deploying the skill and expertise of locally based real estate developers 
the nature and business purpose of these ventures are as follows institutional ventures during and  the company entered into ventures with an unaffiliated partner 
at the respective closing dates  the company sold and or contributed properties containing  units to these ventures and retained a ownership interest in the ventures 
the company s joint venture partner contributed cash equal to of the agreed upon equity value of the properties comprising the ventures  which was then distributed to the company 
the company s strategy with respect to these ventures was to reduce its concentration of properties in a variety of markets 
development ventures since  the company has generally engaged in development activities through various joint ventures with third party developers 
the company uses the local expertise of these developers and lowers the overall risks associated with development by grouping various development properties into aggregate pools 
the company generally contributes between and of the development cost of these projects with the remaining cost financed through third party construction mortgages 
voting rights are shared equally between the company and its respective development partners 
as of december   the company has projects in various stages of development with estimated completion dates ranging through june  the three development agreements currently in place have the following key terms the first development partner has the right  at any time following completion of a project  to stipulate a value for such project and offer to sell its interest in the project to the company based on such value 
if the company chooses not to purchase the interest  it must agree to a sale of the project to an unrelated third party at such value 
the company s partner must exercise this right as to all projects within five years after the receipt of the final certificate of occupancy on the last developed property 
in connection with this development agreement  the company has an obligation to provide up to million in credit enhancements to guarantee a portion of the third party construction financing 
as of february   the company had set aside million towards this credit enhancement 
the company would be required to perform under this agreement only if there was a material default under a third party construction mortgage agreement 
this agreement expires no later than december  notwithstanding the termination of the agreement  the company shall have recourse against its development partner for any losses incurred 
the second development partner has the right  at any time following completion of a project  to require the company to purchase the partners interest in that project at a mutually agreeable price 
if the company and the partner are unable to agree on a price  both parties will obtain appraisals 
if the appraised values vary by more than  both the company and its partner will agree on a third appraiser to determine which original appraisal is closest to its determination of value 
the company may elect at that time not to purchase the property and instead  authorize its partner to sell the project at or above the agreed upon value to an unrelated third party 
five years following the receipt of the final certificate of occupancy on the last developed property  the company must purchase  at the agreed upon price  any projects remaining unsold 
the third development partner has the exclusive right for six months following stabilization generally defined as having achieved occupancy for three consecutive months following the substantial completion of a project to market a project for sale 
thereafter  either the company or its development partner may market a project for sale 
if the company s development partner proposes the sale  the company may elect to purchase the project at the price proposed by its partner or defer the sale until two independent appraisers appraise the project 
if the two appraised values vary by more than  a third appraiser will be chosen to determine the fair market value of the property 
once a value has been determined  the company may elect to purchase the property or authorize its development partner to sell the project at the agreed upon value 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion regarding the company s investments in unconsolidated entities 
in connection with one of its mergers  the company provided a guaranty of a credit enhancement agreement with respect to certain tax exempt bonds issued to finance certain public improvements at a multifamily development project 
the company has the obligation to provide this guaranty for a period of eight years from the consummation of the merger or through may the company would be required to perform under this guaranty only if there was a draw on the letter of credit issued by the credit enhancement party 
the counterparty has also indemnified the company for any losses suffered 
as of february   this guaranty was still in effect at a commitment amount of million and no current outstanding liability 
the following table summarizes the company s contractual obligations for the next five years and thereafter as of december  payments due by year in thousands contractual obligations thereafter total debt a operating leases minimum rent payments b other long term liabilities deferred compensation c other d total a amounts include aggregate principal payments only 
the company paid   and  for interest on debt  inclusive of derivative instruments  for the years ended december   and  respectively

c estimated payments to the company s chairman  former ceo and two other executive officers based on planned retirement dates

critical accounting policies and estimates the company s significant accounting policies are described in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
these policies were followed in preparing the consolidated financial statements at and for the year ended december  the company has identified six significant accounting policies as critical accounting policies 
these critical accounting policies are those that have the most impact on the reporting of our financial condition and those requiring significant judgments and estimates 
with respect to these critical accounting policies  management believes that the application of judgments and assessments is consistently applied and produces financial information that fairly presents the results of operations for all periods presented 
the six critical accounting policies are impairment of long lived assets  including goodwill the company periodically evaluates its long lived assets  including its investments in real estate and goodwill  for indicators of permanent impairment 
the judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on factors such as operational performance  market conditions  expected holding period of each asset and legal and environmental concerns 
future events could occur which would cause the company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and an impairment loss is warranted 
depreciation of investment in real estate the company depreciates the building component of its investment in real estate over a year estimated useful life  building improvements over a year to year estimated useful life and both the furniture  fixtures and equipment and replacements components over a year estimated useful life  all of which are judgmental determinations 
cost capitalization see the capitalization of fixed assets and improvements to real estate section for discussion of the policy with respect to capitalization vs 
expensing of fixed asset repair and maintenance costs 
in addition  the company capitalizes the payroll and associated costs of employees directly responsible for and who spend all of their time on the supervision of major capital projects 
these costs are reflected on the balance sheet as an increase to depreciable property 
the company follows the guidance in sfas no 
 accounting for costs and initial rental operations of real estate projects  for all development projects and uses its professional judgment in determining whether such costs meet the criteria for capitalization or must be expensed as incurred 
the company capitalizes interest  real estate taxes and insurance and payroll and associated costs for those individuals directly responsible for and who spend all of their time on development activities 
the company expenses as incurred all payroll costs of employees working directly at our properties  except for costs that are incurred during the initial lease up phase on a development project 
an allocated portion of payroll costs is capitalized based upon the occupancy of the project until stabilized occupancy is achieved 
the incremental payroll and associated costs are capitalized to the projects under development based upon the effort directly identifiable with such projects 
these costs are reflected on the balance sheet as either construction in progress or a separate component of investments in unconsolidated entities 
the company ceases the capitalization of such costs as the property becomes substantially complete and ready for its intended use 
fair value of financial instruments  including derivative instruments the valuation of financial instruments under sfas no 
and sfas no 
and its amendments sfas nos 
requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the fair value of the instruments 
the company  where possible  bases the fair values of its financial instruments  including its derivative instruments  on listed market prices and third party quotes 
where these are not available  the company bases its estimates on other factors relevant to the financial instruments 
revenue recognition rental income attributable to leases is recorded when due from residents and is recognized monthly as it is earned  which is not materially different than on a straight line basis 
leases entered into between a resident and a property for the rental of an apartment unit are generally year to year  renewable upon consent of both parties on an annual or monthly basis 
interest income is recorded on an accrual basis 
stock based compensation prior to  the company had chosen to account for its stock based compensation in accordance with apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  which resulted in no compensation expense for options issued with an exercise price equal to or exceeding the market value of the company s common shares on the date of grant intrinsic method 
the company has elected to account for its stock based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
and its amendment sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  effective in the first quarter of  which resulted in compensation expense being recorded based on the fair value of the stock compensation granted 
sfas no 
provides three transition methods for entities that adopt the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
the company has chosen to use the prospective method 
this method requires that companies apply the recognition provisions of sfas no 
to only employee awards granted or modified after the beginning of the fiscal year in which the recognition provisions are first applied  or january  compensation expense under all of the company s plans is generally recognized over periods ranging from three months to five years 
therefore  the cost related to stock based employee compensation included in the determination of net income for the year ended december  is less than that which would have been recognized if the fair value based method had been applied to all awards since the original effective date of sfas no 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion and comparative information regarding application of the fair value method to all outstanding employee awards 
funds from operations for the year ended december   funds from operations ffo available to common shares and op units decreased million  or  as compared to the year ended december  for the year ended december   ffo available to common shares and op units increased million  or  as compared to the year ended december  the following is a reconciliation of net income to ffo available to common shares and op units for the years ended december   and funds from operations amounts in thousands year ended december  net income net income allocation to minority interests operating partnership adjustments depreciation depreciation non real estate additions depreciation partially owned properties depreciation unconsolidated properties net gain on sales of unconsolidated entities cumulative effect of change in accounting principle discontinued operations depreciation net gain on sales of depreciable property ffo preferred distributions premium on redemption of preferred shares ffo available to common shares and op units the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit defines funds from operations ffo april white paper as net income computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  excluding gains or losses from sales of property  plus depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis 
the april white paper states that gain or loss on sales of property is excluded from ffo for previously depreciated operating properties only 
once the company commences the conversion of units to condominiums  it simultaneously discontinues depreciation of such property 
accordingly  the company included in ffo its incremental gains or losses from the sale of condominium units to third parties  which represented net gains of   and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
effective january   the company no longer adds back impairment losses when computing ffo in accordance with nareit s definition 
as a result  ffo for the years ended december   and have been reduced by   and  respectively  to conform to the current year presentation 
for the year ended december   ffo has been reduced by  to reflect the sec s clarification of eitf topic d regarding premiums on redemption of preferred shares 
the company believes that ffo is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of the operating performance of a real estate company because it provides investors an understanding of the ability of the company to incur and service debt and to make capital expenditures 
ffo in and of itself does not represent net income or net cash flows from operating activities in accordance with gaap 
therefore  ffo should not be exclusively considered as an alternative to net income or to net cash flows from operating activities as determined by gaap or as a measure of liquidity 
the company s calculation of ffo may differ from other real estate companies due to  among other items  variations in cost capitalization policies for capital expenditures and  accordingly  may not be comparable to such other real estate companies 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market risks relating to the company s operations result primarily from changes in short term libor interest rates 
the company does not have any direct foreign exchange or other significant market risk 
the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the unsecured line of credit 
the company typically incurs fixed rate debt obligations to finance acquisitions and capital expenditures  while it typically incurs floating rate debt obligations to finance working capital needs and as a temporary measure in advance of securing long term fixed rate financing 
the company continuously evaluates its level of floating rate debt with respect to total debt and other factors  including its assessment of the current and future economic environment 
the company also utilizes certain derivative financial instruments to limit market risk 
interest rate protection agreements are used to convert floating rate debt to a fixed rate basis or vice versa 
derivatives are used for hedging purposes rather than speculation 
the company does not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes 
see also note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of derivative instruments 
the fair values of the company s financial instruments including such items in the financial statement captions as cash and cash equivalents  other assets  lines of credit  accounts payable and accrued expenses  rents received in advance and other liabilities approximate their carrying or contract values based on their nature terms and interest rates that approximate current market rates 
the fair value of the company s mortgage notes payable and unsecured notes approximates their carrying value at december  the company had total outstanding floating rate debt of approximately million  or of total debt at december   net of the effects of any derivative instruments 
if market rates of interest on all of the floating rate debt permanently increased by basis points a increase from the company s existing weighted average interest rates  the increase in interest expense on the floating rate debt would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately million 
if market rates of interest on all of the floating rate debt permanently decreased by basis points a decrease from the company s existing weighted average interest rates  the decrease in interest expense on the floating rate debt would increase future earnings and cash flows by approximately million 
at december   the company had total outstanding fixed rate debt of approximately billion  net of the effects of any derivative instruments 
if market rates of interest permanently increased by basis points a increase from the company s existing weighted average interest rates  the estimated fair value of the company s fixed rate debt would be approximately billion 
if market rates of interest permanently decreased by basis points a decrease from the company s existing weighted average interest rates  the estimated fair value of the company s fixed rate debt would be approximately billion 
at december   the company s consolidated derivative instruments had a net asset fair value of approximately million 
if market rates of interest permanently increased by basis points a increase from the company s existing weighted average interest rates  the net asset fair value of the company s consolidated derivative instruments would be approximately million 
if market rates of interest permanently decreased by basis points a decrease from the company s existing weighted average interest rates  the net liability fair value of the company s consolidated derivative instruments would be approximately million 
at december   the company s unconsolidated derivative instruments had a net liability fair value of approximately million 
if market rates of interest permanently increased by basis points a increase from the company s existing weighted average interest rates  the net liability fair value of the company s unconsolidated derivative instruments would be approximately million 
if market rates of interest permanently decreased by basis points a decrease from the company s existing weighted average interest rates  the net liability fair value of the company s unconsolidated derivative instruments would be approximately million 
these amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on the company s financial instruments 
the foregoing assumptions apply to the entire amount of the company s debt and derivative instruments and do not differentiate among maturities 
these analyses do not consider the effects of the changes in overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
further  in the event of changes of such magnitude  management would likely take actions to further mitigate its exposure to the changes 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  this analysis assumes no changes in the company s financial structure or results 
the company cannot predict the effect of adverse changes in interest rates on its debt and derivative instruments and  therefore  its exposure to market risk  nor can there be any assurance that long term debt will be available at advantageous pricing 
consequently  future results may differ materially from the estimated adverse changes discussed above
