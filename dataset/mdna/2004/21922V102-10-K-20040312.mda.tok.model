liquidity and capital resources liquidity is the ability to meet present and future financial obligations either through the sale of existing assets or by the acquisition of additional funds through working capital management 
both the coordination of asset and liability maturities and effective working capital management are important to the maintenance of liquidity 
the company s primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations as determined by rental rates  occupancy levels and property operating expenses  proceeds from its lines of credit  reinvestment of distributions  and proceeds from secured debt 
the company s demands for liquidity include normal property operating activities  payment of principal and interest on outstanding debt  capital expenditures  acquisition of apartment communities  payment of distributions and development costs 
the company has met and expects to continue to meet short term liquidity requirements  generally through the cash flow from operations  equity raised from its dividend reinvestment plan  and borrowings on its lines of credit 
it is expected that these will be adequate to meet all normal property operating expenses  payment of distributions  budgeted capital improvements  and scheduled principal and interest payments on debt in at december   the company had million available under its lines of credit and million in cash and cash equivalents 
in addition  the company had million in reserves held by various lenders for capital expenditures  real estate taxes and insurance 
the company expects to meet certain long term liquidity requirements  such as scheduled debt maturities  the repayment of financing on development activities  and possible property acquisitions  through secured borrowings  possible refinancing  disposition of certain assets that  in our evaluation  may no longer meet our investment requirements or issuance of operating partnership units 
our long term ability to pay distributions to our various stakeholders is dependent upon cash flows from our apartment communities 
while we have substantial cash flow from our operations  on a short term basis  our cash flow is less than our cash needs and we have had to seek alternative funding sources 
during  our cash flow from operating activities was million 
cash required to fund capital improvements to our apartment communities was million 
distributions to our preferred stockholders  operating partnership unit holders and common stockholders were approximately million in we funded the excess of our distributions over our cash flow from ordinary course  short term borrowings of million 
in addition  sales of two properties  executed as a part of our long term business strategy  also provided approximately million 
the sales of these properties did not have a material impact upon our property operating income 
in the event that there continues to be an economic downturn or the national economy does not recover sufficiently and the cash flow from operations are no longer adequate  the company has additional means  such as its borrowing availability on its lines of credit  to help meet our short term liquidity demands 
the company considers on a regular basis what level of distributions to common shareholders is appropriate  and there is no assurance that the company s distribution to common shareholders will continue at the current level 

table of contents operating activities for the year ended december   our net cash provided by operating activities was million  compared to million for the same period in this decline is due primarily to the economic downturn in the national economy and the related decline in our operating activities

critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which require us to make estimates and assumptions 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies  among others  involve our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
capital expenditures the company capitalized expenditures related to acquiring new assets  materially enhancing the value of an existing asset or substantially extending the useful life of an existing asset 
expenditures necessary to maintain an existing asset in ordinary operating condition  such as repairs and maintenance  are expensed as incurred 
the company capitalizes interest  real estate taxes  insurance and certain internal development and related overhead costs directly to the apartment community under development 
interest is capitalized to development projects based upon the weighted average cumulative project costs for each period multiplied by the company s borrowing costs on its line of credit  expressed as a percentage 
the internal development and related overhead costs are capitalized to the development projects based upon the effort identifiable with such projects 
prior to the commencement of leasing activities  interest and other construction costs are capitalized and reflected on the balance sheet as real estate under development 
the company ceases the capitalization of such costs as the apartment homes become substantially complete and available for occupancy 
the company capitalized million of improvements to its various apartment communities during the asset preservation capital expenditures  including floor coverings  hvac equipment  roofs  appliances  siding  exterior painting  parking lots  and other non revenue enhancing capital expenditures totaled million 
revenue enhancing capital expenditures  including interior upgrades  gating and access systems totaled million for redevelopment expenditures  including amenities that add a material new feature or revenue source at our acquired apartment communities  totaled million 
the company capitalized costs of million in development costs for the company s total non real estate capital additions  such as computer software  computer equipment  furniture and fixtures and property improvements to the company s management offices and its corporate offices  was approximately million and is reflected on the balance sheet in the other asset category 
the company is also required by various lenders to fund a replacement reserve in advance for capital improvements 

table of contents the company s capital improvement budget is reviewed continually and adjustments will be made if deemed necessary 
real estate assets impairment assessment we periodically assess our real estate assets for possible permanent impairment when certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of real estate may not be recoverable 
management considers current market conditions and tenant credit analysis in determining whether the recoverability of the carrying amount of an asset should be assessed 
when an assessment is warranted  management determines if it is probable that the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows over the expected holding period is less than the carrying amount of the property being assessed 
if the undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount  then an impairment loss would be recognized equal to the amount of the difference between the fair value of the property and its carrying amount 
no impairment losses have been recorded to date 
real estate assets allocation of purchase price the company accounts for acquisitions utilizing the purchase method  and accordingly  the results of the acquisition properties are included in the company s results of operations from the date of acquisition 
the company allocates the purchase price to the acquired tangibles  consisting of land  building and improvements  and if material  identified intangible assets and liabilities of above below market leases and at market leases in place based on their fair values 
allocation of fair value to real estate assets were based on internal management estimates on a property by property basis using discounted cash flows using market capitalization rates 
all liabilities with maturities in excess of one year assumed in connection with an acquisition is marked to market at the date of the acquisition using a market interest rate in effect at that date for similar debt agreements with similar maturities 
the resulting premium or discount is amortized into interest expense over the life of the related debt agreement using the effective interest method 
determinations of fair values used in purchase price allocation are by their nature subjective and may have a significant impact on reported asset and liability balances in the consolidated balance sheets and in the reported amounts of depreciation expense and interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
rental revenue and related cost recognition rental income and other income are recorded on an accrual basis 
rental concessions and direct lease costs associated with lease origination are amortized on a straight line basis over the terms of the respective leases 
the company s apartment communities are leased under lease agreements that  typically  have terms that do not exceed one year 
deferred rental concessions and direct lease costs were million and million at december  and  respectively 
recent accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued interpretation  consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin which was revised in december  and is effective immediately for all transactions entered into with variable interest entities before february the provisions of fin must be applied to all remaining entities subject to the interpretation from the beginning of the first quarter of this statement defines the identification process of variable interest entities and how an entity assesses its interest in a variable interest entity to decide whether to consolidate that entity 
the company has formed wholly owned subsidiaries for financing purposes and such financing is reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
currently  the company does not anticipate this statement having a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
at the july  emerging issues task force meeting  the sec observer clarified the application of topic d related to preferred stock issuance costs 
according to the clarification  all preferred stock issuance costs  regardless of where in the stockholders equity section the costs were initially recorded  should be charged to income available to common shareholders for the purpose of calculating earnings per share at the time the 
table of contents preferred stock is redeemed 
the sec observer indicated that preferred stock issuance costs not previously charged to income available to common shareholders should be reflected retroactively in financial statements for reporting periods ending after september  by restating the financial statements of prior periods on an as filed basis 
we have included these costs in determination of the excess of consideration paid over book value to preferred shareholders in our consolidated statement of operations  therefore  no adjustment was required 
market risk disclosure the company is subject to changes in the fair market value of its fixed rate secured debt amounting to million at december  if market interest rates for fixed rate debt were basis points higher at december   the fair value of fixed rate debt would decrease by million to million 
if market interest rates for fixed rate debt were basis points lower at december   the fair value of fixed rate debt would have increased from million to million 
the company has market risk exposure to short term interest rates from variable rate borrowings under its existing secured line of credit and variable rate secured debt 
the existing secured lines of credit bears interest at libor plus 
the company may utilize variable rate debt up to specified limits to total market capitalization 
the company has analyzed its interest rate risk exposure 
if market interest rates for these types of credit facilities average basis points more in than they did in  and the company s secured lines of credit were at the maximum of million  and the variable rate secured debt remained at million  the company s interest expense would increase  and net income would decrease by million 
these amounts are determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on the company s borrowing cost
