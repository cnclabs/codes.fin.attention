overview the company is a specialized commercial finance company that provides microticket equipment leasing and other financing services in amounts generally ranging from to  with an average amount financed of approximately  the company primarily leases pos authorization systems and other small business equipment to small commercial enterprises 
the company derives the majority of its revenues from leases originated and held by the company  payments on service contracts  rental payments  and fee income 
historically  the company funded the majority of leases  contracts and loans through its revolving credit and term loan facilities the credit facilities and on balance sheet securitizations  and to a lesser extent  its subordinated debt program subordinated debt and internally generated funds 
as of september   the credit facility failed to renew and the company began paying down the balance of the debt 
at december   the company was in default of certain of its debt covenants in its credit facility and securitization agreements 
the covenants that were in default with respect to the credit facility  require that the company maintain a fixed charge ratio in an amount not less than of consolidated earnings  a consolidated tangible net worth minimum of million plus of net income quarterly beginning with september  and compliance with the borrowing base 
the covenants that were in default with respect to the securitization agreements  require that the company maintain a fixed charge ratio in an amount not less than of consolidated earnings and a consolidated tangible net worth greater than million plus of net income for each fiscal quarter after june  on april   the company entered into a long term agreement with its lenders 
this long term agreement waived the defaults described above  and in consideration for the waiver  required the outstanding balance of the loan to be repaid over a term of months beginning in april at an interest rate of prime plus 
the company received a waiver  which was set to expire on april   for the covenant violations in connection with the securitization agreement 
subsequently  the company received a permanent waiver of the covenant defaults and the securitization agreement was amended so that going forward  the covenants are the same as those contained in the long term agreement entered into on april   for the senior credit facility 
in october  the company was forced to suspend virtually all new contract originations until a new source of financing is obtained or until such time as the credit facility has been paid in full 
the company is currently in the process of pursuing alternative financing sources 
in february  the company was advised by the new york stock exchange nyse that it was not in compliance with the nyse s continued listing standards 
specifically  the company did not meet the following requirements based on a consecutive thirty day trading period average market capitalization of not less than million and a share price of not less than 
in accordance with the continued listing criteria set forth by the nyse  on april   the company presented a plan which management believed had the potential to bring the company back into compliance with the listing standards within the required timeframes 
subsequently  the company was able to achieve and maintain compliance with the continued listing criteria 
the company continues to work closely with the nyse in the execution of its plan objectives 
in a typical lease transaction  the company originates leases through its network of independent dealers 
upon approval of a lease application by the company and verification that the lessee has both received the equipment and signed the lease  the company pays the dealer the cost of the equipment  plus the dealer s profit margin 
in a typical transaction for the acquisition of service contracts  a homeowner purchases a security system and simultaneously signs a contract with the dealer for the monitoring of that system for a monthly fee 
upon credit approval of the monitoring application and verification with the homeowner that the system is installed  the company purchases from the dealer the right to the payment stream under that monitoring contract at a negotiated multiple of the monthly payments 
substantially all leases originated or acquired by the company are non cancelable 
during the term of the lease  the company is scheduled to receive payments sufficient  in the aggregate  to cover the company s borrowing costs and the costs of the underlying equipment  and to provide the company with an appropriate profit 
the company enhances the profitability of its leases  contracts and loans by charging late fees  prepayment penalties  loss and damage waiver fees and other service fees  when applicable 
collection fees are imposed based on the company s estimate of the costs of collection 
the company may only impose late fees on the first four months of late payments and is prohibited from imposing compound late fees or from assessing late fees as a percentage of the total outstanding late payments including outstanding late fees 
the loss and damage waiver fees are charged if a customer fails to provide proof of insurance and are reasonably related to the cost of replacing the lost or damaged equipment or product 
the initial non cancelable term of the lease is equal to or less than the equipment s estimated economic life and often provides the company with additional revenues based on the residual value of the equipment financed at the end of the initial term of the lease 
initial terms of the leases in the company s portfolio generally range from to months  with an average initial term of months as of december  substantially all service and rental contracts are month to month contracts with expected terms of years for service contracts  months for lessees that continue to rent their equipment beyond the original term  and months for other types of rental contracts 
critical accounting policies in response to the sec s release no 
 cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies  management identified the most critical accounting principles upon which our financial status depends 
the company determined the critical principles by considering accounting policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments 
we identified our most critical accounting policies to be those related to revenue recognition and maintaining the allowance for credit losses 
these accounting policies are discussed below as well as within the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company s lease contracts are accounted for as financing leases 
at origination  the company records the gross lease receivable  the estimated residual value of the leased equipment  initial direct costs incurred and the unearned lease income 
unearned lease income is the amount by which the gross lease receivable plus the estimated residual value exceeds the cost of the equipment 
unearned lease income and initial direct costs incurred are amortized over the related lease term using the interest method 
amortization of unearned lease income and initial direct costs is suspended if  in the opinion of management  full payment of the contractual amount due under the lease agreement is doubtful 
in conjunction with the origination of leases  the company may retain a residual interest in the underlying equipment upon termination of the lease 
the value of such interests is estimated at inception of the lease and evaluated periodically for impairment 
other revenues such as loss and damage waiver fees  service fees relating to the leases  contracts and loans  and rental revenues are recognized as they are earned 
the company s investments in cancelable service contracts are recorded at cost and amortized over the expected life of the service period 
income on service contracts from monthly billings is recognized as the related services are provided 
the company periodically evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that may affect the estimated useful life or recoverability of the investment in service contracts 
rental equipment is either recorded at estimated residual value and depreciated using the straight line method over a period of months or at the acquisition cost and depreciated using the straight line method over a period of months 
loans are reported at their outstanding principal balance 
interest income on loans is recognized as it is earned 
allowance for credit losses the company maintains an allowance for credit losses on its investment in leases  service contracts  rental contracts and loans at an amount that it believes is sufficient to provide adequate protection against losses in its portfolio 
the allowance is determined principally on the basis of the historical loss experience of the company and the level of recourse provided by such lease  service contract  rental contract or loan  if any  and reflects management s judgment of additional loss potential considering current economic conditions and the nature and characteristics of the underlying lease portfolio 
the company determines the necessary periodic provision for credit losses taking into account actual and expected losses in the portfolio as a whole and the relationship of the allowance to the net investment in leases  service contracts  rental contracts and loans 
such provisions generally represent a percentage of funded amounts of leases  contracts and loans 
the resulting charge is included in the provision for credit losses 
leases  service contracts  rental contracts and loans are charged against the allowance for credit losses and are put on non accrual when they are deemed to be uncollectable 
generally  the company deems leases  service contracts  rental contracts and loans to be uncollectable when one of the following occurs i the obligor files for bankruptcy  ii the obligor dies  and the equipment is returned  or iii when an account has become days delinquent without contact with the lessee 
the typical monthly payment under the company s leases is between and per month 
as a result of these small monthly payments  the company s experience is that lessees will pay past due amounts later in the process because of the small amount necessary to bring an account current at days past due  a lessee may only owe lease payments of between and 
the company has developed and regularly updates proprietary credit scoring systems designed to improve its risk based pricing 
the company uses credit scoring in most  but not all  of its extensions of credit 
in addition  the company aggressively employs collection procedures and a legal process to resolve any credit problems 
results of operations revenue change change in thousands income on financing leases and loans    income on service contracts    rental income    service fees and other    total revenues    the company s lease contracts are accounted for as financing leases 
at origination  the company records the gross lease receivable  the estimated residual value of the leased equipment  initial direct costs incurred and the unearned lease income 
unearned lease income is the amount by which the gross lease receivable plus the estimated residual value exceeds the cost of the equipment 
unearned lease income and initial direct costs incurred are amortized over the related lease term using the interest method 
other revenues such as loss and damage waiver fees  service fees relating to the leases  contracts and loans  and rental revenues are recognized as they are earned 
total revenues for the year ended december  were million  a decrease of million  or  from the year ended december  the decline in revenue was due to decreases of million  or  in income on financing leases and loans and million  or  in service fee and other income 
in addition  rental revenue decreased million or and income on service contracts decreased million  or  as compared to such amounts in the previous year s period 
the overall decrease in revenue can be attributed to the decrease in the overall size of the company s portfolio of leases  rentals and service contracts 
the shrinking portfolio is a direct result of the company s decision during the third quarter of to cease funding new originations as a result of its lenders not renewing the revolving credit facility on september  revenues are expected to continue to decline so long as the company is not originating new contracts 
total revenues for the year ended december   were million  a decrease of million  or  from the year ended december   due primarily to decreases of million  or  in income on financing leases and loans and million  or  in service fee and other income  offset by an increase of  or in rental and service contract income over such amounts in the previous year s period 
the decrease in income on financing leases and loans was due to the decreased number of leases originated primarily resulting from the company s decision during the third quarter of to suspend the funding of new contracts 
the decrease in fee income and other income is the result of decreased fees from the lessees related to the collection and legal process employed by the company 
the increase in rental and service contract income is a result of the increased number of lessees that have continued to rent their equipment beyond their original lease term  the acquisition of the rental portfolio of resource leasing corporation  and increased originations in rental and service contracts in selling  general and administrative change change in thousands selling  general and administrative    as a percent of revenue our selling  general and administrative sg a expenses include costs of maintaining corporate functions including accounting  finance  collections  legal  human resources  information systems and communications 
sg a expenses also include commissions  service fees and other marketing costs associated with the company s portfolio of leases and rental contracts 
sg a expenses decreased by million  or  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  the decrease was primarily driven by a reduction in personnel related expenses of approximately million  as management reduced headcount from to  million decrease in collection related expenses  million in cost of goods sold  and  reduction in rent expense 
the expense reductions were achieved as management continued to align the company s infrastructure with the current business conditions 
sg a expenses increased by  or  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  marketing programs increased by million  or  due to increased dealer service fees paid on a portfolio of leases acquired in legal services increased by million  or  primarily due to costs incurred for the different class actions and investigations and in conjunction with the workout on the company s credit facility and securitization covenant defaults 
compensation expenses decreased by million  or  primarily due to staff reductions 
provision for credit losses change change in thousands provision for credit losses    as a percent of revenue the company maintains an allowance for credit losses on its investment in leases  service contracts  rental contracts and loans at an amount that it believes is sufficient to provide adequate protection against losses in its portfolio 
the company s provision for credit losses decreased by million  or  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   while net charge offs increased to million 
the provision was based on the company s historical policy of providing a provision for credit losses based upon the dealer fundings and revenue recognized in any period  as well as taking into account actual and expected losses in the portfolio as a whole and the relationship of the allowance to the net investment in leases  service contracts  rental contracts and loans 
the company s provision for credit losses increased by million  or  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   while net charge offs increased to million 
this provision was based on the company s historical policy  based on experience  of providing a provision for credit losses based upon the dealer fundings and revenue recognized in any period and reflects management s judgement of loss potential considering current economic conditions and the nature of the underlying receivables 
the company took an additional provision of million during the third quarter of to reserve against certain dealer receivables as well as delinquent portfolio assets 
in the past  dealer receivables had been offset  in some instances  against the funding of new contracts 
since the company has suspended the funding of new deals  the company feels that the collection of these receivables will be more difficult 
although the company will continue to pursue collections on these accounts  management believes that the cost associated with the legal enforcement would outweigh the benefits realized 
depreciation and amortization change change in thousands depreciation and amortization    as a percent of revenue depreciation and amortization expenses consist primarily of the depreciation taken against fixed assets and rental equipment  and the amortization of the company s investment in service contracts 
the company s investment in fixed assets is recorded at cost and amortized over the expected life of the service period of the asset 
rental equipment is either recorded at estimated residual value and depreciated using the straight line method over a period of months or at the acquisition cost and depreciated using the straight line method over a period of months 
service contracts are recorded at cost and amortized over months 
the company periodically evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that may affect the estimated useful life or recoverability of the asset and any resulting charge is made to depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation and amortization decreased by million  or  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   primarily due to the decrease in the overall portfolio of service and rental contracts 
for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   depreciation and amortization increased by million  or  due to the increased number of rental contracts and amortization of the company s investment in service contracts 
interest expense change change in thousands interest    as a percent of revenue the company pays interest on borrowings under the senior credit facility  subordinated debt and the on balance sheet securitizations 
interest expense decreased by million  or  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  this decrease resulted primarily from the company s decreased level of borrowings 
at december   the company had notes payable of  compared to  at december  interest expense decreased by million  or  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  this decrease resulted primarily from the company s declining cost of funds as well as a decreased level of borrowings 
other operating data dealer fundings were million during the year ended december   a decrease of million  or  compared to the year ended december  
this decrease is a result of the failure of the credit facility to renew  which  in turn  forced the company to suspend virtually all new contract originations in the third quarter of receivables due in installments  estimated residual values  loans receivable  investment in service contracts  and investment in rental equipment also decreased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   representing a decrease of million  or 
unearned income decreased by million  or  from million at december  to million at december  this decrease was primarily due to continued amortization and a lack of new lease originations in net cash provided by operating activities decreased by million  or  to million during the year ended december   from the year ended december   because of the decrease in the size of the company s overall portfolio 
dealer fundings were million during the year ended december   a decrease of million  or  compared to the year ended december  this decrease is a result of the failure of the credit facility to renew  which in turn  forced the company to suspend virtually all new contract originations in the third quarter of receivables due in installments  estimated residual values  loans receivable  investment in service contracts  and investment in rental equipment also decreased from million for the year ended december   to million for the year ended december   representing a decrease of million  or 
unearned income decreased by million  or  from million at december  to million at december  this decrease was primarily due to the decrease in dealer fundings during net cash provided by operating activities decreased by million to million during the year ended december   or  from the year ended december  because of the decrease in the size of the company s overall portfolio 
exposure to credit losses the following table sets forth certain information as of december   and  with respect to delinquent leases  service contracts and loans 
the percentages in the table below represent the aggregate on such date of the actual amounts not paid on each invoice by the number of days past due  rather than the entire balance of a delinquent receivable  over the cumulative amount billed at such date from the date of origination on all leases  service contracts  and loans in the company s portfolio 
for example  if a receivable is days past due  the portion of the receivable that is over days past due will be placed in the days past due category  the portion of the receivable which is over days past due will be placed in the days past due category and the portion of the receivable which is over days past due will be placed in the over days past due category 
the company historically used this methodology of calculating its delinquencies because of its experience that lessees who miss a payment do not necessarily default on the entire lease 
accordingly  the company includes only the amount past due rather than the entire lease receivable in each category 
as of december  cumulative amounts billed in thousands    days past due days past due over days past due total past due liquidity and capital resources general the company s lease and finance business is capital intensive and requires access to substantial short term and long term credit to fund new leases  contracts and loans 
since inception  the company has funded its operations primarily through borrowings under its credit facilities  its on balance sheet securitizations  the issuance of subordinated debt and an initial public offering completed in february of the company will continue to require significant additional capital to maintain and expand its volume of leases  contracts and loans funded  as well as to fund any future acquisitions of leasing companies or portfolios 
the company s uses of cash include the origination and acquisition of leases  contracts and loans  payment of interest expenses  repayment of borrowings under its credit facilities  subordinated debt and securitizations  payment of selling  general and administrative expenses  income taxes and capital expenditures 
the company utilizes its credit facilities to fund the origination and acquisition of leases that satisfy the eligibility requirements established pursuant to each facility 
on august   the company entered into a new million credit facility with nine banks  expiring on september  as of september   the credit facility failed to renew and the company began paying down the outstanding balance 
as a result of the failure to renew  the company was forced to suspend essentially all new contract originations until a new source of financing is obtained or at such time that the senior credit facility has been paid in full 
at december   the company was in default of certain of its debt covenants in its credit facility 
the covenants that were in default with respect to the credit facility  require that the company maintain a fixed charge ratio in an amount not less than of consolidated earnings  a consolidated tangible net worth minimum of million plus of net income quarterly beginning with september   and compliance with the borrowing base 
on april   the company entered into a long term agreement with its lenders 
this long term agreement waives the defaults described above  and in consideration for this waiver  requires the outstanding balance of the loan to be repaid over a term of months beginning in april at an interest rate of prime plus 
based on the amortization schedule in the new agreement  as subsequently amended in june and november  as of december   the company is obligated to repay a minimum of million  plus applicable interest  over the next twelve months 
at december   the company had approximately million outstanding under the facility 
the company  through its wholly owned subsidiary  leasecomm corporation  periodically finances its lease and service contracts  together with unguaranteed residuals  through securitizations using special purpose entities 
the assets of such special purpose entities and cash collateral or other accounts created in connection with the financings in which they participate are not available to pay creditors of leasecomm corporation  microfinancial incorporated  or other affiliates 
however  the special purpose entities to which such assets are contributed are required under generally accepted accounting principles to be consolidated in the financial statements of the company 
as a result  such assets and the related liability remain on the balance sheet and do not receive gain on sale treatment 
at december   the company was in default of certain of its debt covenants in its securitization agreements 
the covenants that were in default with respect to the securitization agreements  required that the company maintain a fixed charge ratio in an amount not less than of consolidated earnings and a consolidated tangible net worth greater than million plus of net income for each fiscal quarter after june  the company received a permanent waiver of the covenant defaults and the securitization agreement was amended so that going forward  the covenants are the same as those contained in the long term agreement entered into on april   for the senior credit facility 
to date  cash flows from its portfolio and other fees have been sufficient to repay amounts borrowed under the securitization agreements 
at december   the company had approximately million outstanding under its securitizations 
microfinancial has taken certain steps in an effort to improve its financial position 
management continues to actively consider various financing  restructuring and strategic alternatives as well as continuing to work closely with the company s lenders to ensure continued compliance with the terms of the long term agreement 
in addition  management has taken steps to reduce overhead and align its infrastructure with current business conditions  including a reduction in headcount from at december  to at december  the failure or inability of microfinancial to successfully carry out these plans could ultimately have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position and its ability to meet its obligations when due 
the consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty 
provided that the company continues to comply with the terms of the long term bank agreement  including the suspension of new contract originations  the company believes that cash flows from its existing portfolio will be sufficient to fund the company s operations for the foreseeable future 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the company has entered into various agreements  such as the long term debt agreements  capital lease agreements and operating lease agreements that require future payments be made 
long term debt agreements include all debt outstanding under the credit facility  securitizations  subordinated notes  demand notes and other notes payable

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general risks microfinancial incurred net losses of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the net losses incurred by the company during the third and fourth quarters of caused the company to be in default of certain debt covenants in its credit facility and securitization agreements 
in addition  as of september   the company s credit facility failed to renew and consequently  the company was forced to suspend new origination activity as of october  on april   the company entered into a long term agreement with its lenders 
this long term agreement waives the covenant defaults as of december   and in consideration for this waiver  requires the outstanding balance of the loan to be repaid over a term of months beginning in april at an interest rate of prime plus 
the company received a waiver  which was set to expire on april   for the covenant violations in connection with the securitization agreement 
subsequently  the company received a permanent waiver of the covenant defaults and the securitization agreement was amended so that going forward  the covenants are the same as those contained in the long term agreement entered into on april   for the senior credit facility 
to date  the company has fulfilled all of its debt obligations  as agreed to by the bank group  in a timely manner 
microfinancial has taken certain steps in an effort to improve its financial position 
management continues to actively consider various financing  restructuring and strategic alternatives as well as continuing to work closely with the company s lenders to ensure continued compliance with the terms of the long term agreement 
in addition  management has taken steps to reduce overhead and align its infrastructure with current business conditions  including a reduction in headcount from at december  to at december  the failure or inability of microfinancial to successfully carry out these plans could ultimately have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position and its ability to meet its obligations when due 
the consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty 
market rate sensitive instruments and risk management the following discussion about the company s risk management activities includes forward looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
this analysis presents the hypothetical loss in earnings  cash flows  and fair value of the financial instruments held by the company at december   that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the company has used interest rate swaps to manage the primary market exposures associated with underlying liabilities and anticipated transactions 
the company used these instruments to reduce risk by creating offsetting market exposures 
the instruments held by the company are not held for trading purposes 
in the normal course of operations  the company also faces risks that are either nonfinancial or nonquantifiable 
such risks principally include credit risk  and legal risk  and are not represented in the analysis that follows 
interest rate risk management the implicit yield to the company on all of its leases  contracts and loans is on a fixed interest rate basis due to the leases  contracts and loans having scheduled payments that are fixed at the time of origination of the lease 
when the company originates or acquires leases  contracts  and loans it bases its pricing in part on the spread it expects to achieve between the implicit yield rate to the company on each lease and the effective interest cost it will pay when it finances such leases  contracts and loans through its credit facility 
increases in interest rates during the term of each lease  contract or loan could narrow or eliminate the spread  or result in a negative spread 
the company has adopted a policy designed to protect itself against interest rate volatility during the term of each lease  contract or loan 
given the relatively short average life of the company s leases  contracts and loans  the company s goal is to maintain a blend of fixed and variable interest rate obligations 
currently  given the fixed repayment schedules of the company s outstanding debt  the company is limited in its ability to manage the blend of fixed and variable rate interest obligations 
as of december   the company s outstanding fixed rate indebtedness outstanding under the company s securitizations and subordinated debt represented of the company s total outstanding indebtedness 
the company s credit facility bears interest at rates  which fluctuate with changes in the prime rate or the day libor 
the company s interest expense on its credit facility and the fair value of its fixed rate debt is sensitive to changes in market interest rates 
the effect of a adverse change in market interest rates  sustained for one year  on the company s interest expense and the fair value of its fixed rate debt would be  and  respectively
