item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this annual report on form k contains  in addition to historical information  forward looking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results could differ materially from the results anticipated by the company and discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences are discussed below in the section entitled forward looking statements and elsewhere in this annual report 
the following discussion should be read together with our financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this document 
general the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to customer programs and incentives  bad debts  inventories  income taxes  warranty obligations  financing operations  restructuring  and contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
overview the company s products and services are ultimately directed to consumers in the large and growing global marketplace for aesthetic enhancement 
as such  general economic factors that affect consumer confidence and spending are factors that are pertinent to the company 
the primary source of revenue for the company is from consumers who are specifically seeking to whiten their teeth using the most advanced technology available 
this technology is offered through the company s wholly owned centers and its associate centers both in the us and international markets 
the company promotes demand for its products and services by advertising directly to the consumer  while also offering a range of whitening and post whitening maintenance retail products that generate significant additional revenue 
as of march  the company had centers in metropolitan areas in the us and approximately  associated centers in the us and international markets 
the management of the company focuses on optimizing the productivity of the existing base of latw systems  both in terms of the number of procedures performed per system and retail product revenue per procedure or venue  and also on growing the number of latw systems deployed in the market place 
the marketing initiatives of the company are carefully constructed and monitored in such a way that management can determine their impact on revenue generation 
in addition  management seeks to leverage a cost base that includes  among other items  the cost of materials for the procedures and retail products  property and equipment lease expenses  employee salaries and marketing expenses 
after the first introduction of the bs system in  the company initially focused on building the system footprint and building brand awareness 
more recently  management has focused on increasing operating efficiency by increasing the productivity of the expansive network of associated centers and company owned centers and streamlining the cost structure 
during  management was able to significantly decrease the amount spent on advertising while simultaneously growing revenues 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition britesmile recognizes revenue related to retail products at the time such products are sold to customers 
the company recognizes revenue from teeth whitening procedures performed at its centers when the procedures have been performed 
the company defers the revenue generated on the sale of key cards and activation codes to associated centers and recognizes the income over the estimated performance period 
prior to  the company estimated the performance period to be days 
due to our ongoing efforts in monitoring key card usage  we have reduced our estimated performance period from days to days 
the effect of this change increased revenues in by  revenue is reported net of discounts and allowances 
the company will continue to monitor this policy and if factors change in a material way will adjust it accordingly 
additionally  associated center revenue for  and has been reduced by  for each year due to charges related to warrants issued to orthodontic centers of america oca 
deferred contract costs during  the company granted warrants to oca in consideration of oca installing bs machines in oca centers 
the value of the warrants was capitalized as deferred contract costs and is being amortized as a reduction of revenue over the life of the agreement years 
during  the company introduced the magic mirror  a marketing product designed to show potential customers what their teeth will look like after a latw procedure 
the company provides the magic mirror to customers who sign a five year contract to purchase a minimum number of key cards each month 
in accordance with eitf  accounting for consideration given to a vendor to a customer including the reseller of a vendor s products  the cost of the magic mirrors provided to customers has been capitalized as deferred contract costs and is being amortized to cost of goods sold over the life of the contract 
at december  the amount capitalized was management will continually assess the recoverability of these costs 
bad debt britesmile maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the ultimate realization of accounts receivable including the current credit worthiness of each customer 
if the financial condition of britesmile s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
at december  the allowance was  inventory britesmile states its inventories at the lower of average cost or market 
britesmile writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions  as well as for damaged goods 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
during  the company experienced inventory costing problems that resulted in a  inventory adjustment  a charge recorded in the third quarter 
management believes that it has addressed the inventory costing issues and does not anticipate similar adjustments in the future 
property  equipment and improvements britesmile evaluates its property  equipment and improvements for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist 
in  the company wrote off  of leasehold improvements in connection with the relocation of the center in houston to the galleria and  for the honolulu location  following the decision to close the honolulu center see store location closures below 
no impairment charges were recorded during store closures during  britesmile recorded significant reserves in connection with store closures 
these reserves include estimates pertaining to employee separation costs and the settlements of contractual obligations  primarily property leases 
although the company does not anticipate significant changes  the actual costs related to the closures may differ from these estimates 
during the company made adjustments to previous estimates of lease liabilities  which resulted in an increase to this reserve in the amount of  the company anticipates an additional  to be recorded in the first quarter of for severance and lease liabilities associated with the closure of the honolulu center in january legal contingencies britesmile is currently a party to certain legal actions 
management does not believe that current pending litigation will have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position 
this conclusion has been developed in consultation with outside counsel handling the company s representation in these matters 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in management s assumptions and the effectiveness of the company s strategies related to these legal actions

see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk factors that may affect our performance inflation most of the company s products are purchased in finished form and packaged by the supplier or at the company s headquarters 
the company anticipates usual inflationary increases in the price of its products and does not intend to pass these increases along to its customers 
in general  the company does not believe that inflation has had a material effect on its results of operations in recent years 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s business will not be affected by inflation in the future 
seasonality the company believes that its business follows seasonal trends due to increased consumer demand during the spring and early summer months  and around public and national holidays 
as a result  the company s sales performance could potentially be affected 
forward looking statements the statements contained in this report that are not purely historical are forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of and section e of the securities exchange act 
these statements relate to the company s expectations  hopes  beliefs  anticipations  commitments  intentions and strategies regarding the future 
they may be identified by the use of words or phrases such as believes  expects  anticipates  should  plans  estimates  and potential  among others 
forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  statements contained in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations regarding the company s financial performance  revenue and expense levels in the future and the sufficiency of its existing assets to fund future operations and capital spending needs 
actual results could differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in such forward looking statements 
the company believes that many of the risks set forth here and in the company s filings with the securities and exchange commission are part of doing business in the industry in which the company operates and competes and will likely be present in all periods reported 
the forward looking statements contained in this report are made as of the date of this report and the company assumes no obligation to update them or to update the reasons why actual results could differ from those projected in such forward looking statements 
among others  risks and uncertainties that may affect the business  financial condition  performance  development  and results of operations of the company include we have a limited operating history upon which to evaluate our likelihood of success 
we have only manufactured and distributed our bs since november  the bs since november and the bspb since may we opened our first center in walnut creek  california in february  and britesmile associated centers began performing latw procedures in april therefore  we have a limited relevant operating history upon which to evaluate the likelihood of our success 
investors must evaluate the likelihood of our success in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered in the operation and expansion of a new business and the development and marketing of new products 
we cannot be certain that our business strategy will be successful or that we will successfully address these risks and difficulties 
our failure to address any of these risks or difficulties could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we have a history of losses and accumulated deficit and this trend of losses may continue in the future 
for  and  we had a net loss of million  million  and million  respectively 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was million 
our ability to reach and sustain profitability will depend  in part  upon the successful marketing of our existing services and products and the successful and timely introduction of new services and products 
we can give no assurances that we will achieve profitability or  if achieved  that we will sustain profitability 
our success will depend on acceptance of our latw process and post whitening maintenance products 
we derive substantially all of our revenues from our latw procedures  a relatively new teeth whitening concept for consumers 
we also market britesmile brand toothpaste  electric toothbrushes  mouthwash  chewing gum  the britesmile to go pen  and post whitening procedure touchup kits through our centers and associated centers and on our website 
our success will depend in large part on our ability to successfully encourage consumers  dentists and dental office employees to switch from traditional and less expensive bleaching tray whitening methods to our latw system  and on our ability to successfully market our line of whitening and post whitening maintenance products 
there can be no assurance that consumers will accept our procedure or products 
typically  medical and dental insurance policies do not cover teeth whitening procedures  including the company s latw procedure  or whitening maintenance products  which may have an adverse impact upon the market acceptance of our products and services 
our success will depend on our ability to update our technology to remain competitive 
the dental device and supply industry is subject to technological change 
as technological changes occur in the marketplace  we may have to modify our products in order to become or remain competitive or to ensure that our products do not become obsolete 
while we are continuing our research and development efforts to improve our current latw systems in order to strengthen our competitive advantage  we cannot assure that we will successfully implement technological improvements to our latw systems on a timely basis  or at all 
if we fail to anticipate or respond in a cost effective and timely manner to government requirements  market trends or customer demands  or if there are any significant delays in product development or introduction  our revenues and profit margins may decline which could adversely affect our cash flows  liquidity and operating results 
we may have problems financing our future growth 
our growth strategy includes investment in and expansion of centers and associated centers throughout the united states and internationally  increasing awareness of the britesmile brand and developing and marketing our brand name and retail products 
to finance our prior growth we have sold debt and equity securities  however  additional funds may be needed in the future for continued expansion 
we cannot assure that additional financing will be available or that  if available  it will be on terms favorable to our stockholders or us 
if needed funds are not available  we may be required to close existing centers  and or limit or forego the establishment of new centers and associated centers and the development of new products  or limit the scope of our current operations  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we may be required to take other actions that may lessen the value of our common stock  including borrowing money on terms that are not favorable to us 
raising the needed funds through the sale of additional shares of our common stock or securities convertible into shares of common stock may result in dilution to current stockholders 
we are subject to competition 
the market for teeth whitening products and services is highly competitive 
competition in the market for teeth whitening products and services may intensify in the future 
numerous well established companies and smaller entrepreneurial companies are focusing significant resources on developing and marketing products and services that will compete with our products and services 
in addition  many of our current and potential competitors have greater financial  technical  operational and marketing resources 
teeth whitening products and services offered by our competitors include traditional and often less expensive bleaching tray methods and other forms of heat or light activated curing methods 
we may not be able to compete successfully against these competitors in developing  marketing and distributing our services and products  which could result in the loss of customers and could have a material adverse effect on our business 
competitive pressures may also force prices for teeth whitening services down and such price reductions may adversely affect our potential future revenue 
future growth may place strains on our managerial  operational and financial resources and we may be unable to recruit and retain qualified personnel 
if we grow as expected  a significant strain on our managerial  operational and financial resources may occur 
further  as the number of associated centers  customers  advertisers and other business partners grows  we will be required to manage multiple relationships with various center dentists  associated center dentists  customers  strategic partners and other third parties 
future growth or an increase in the number of our strategic relationships may strain our managerial  operational and financial resources  thereby inhibiting our ability to achieve the rapid execution necessary to successfully implement our business plan 
in addition  our future success will also depend on our ability to expand our sales and marketing organization and our support organization commensurate with the growth of our business 
we may experience shortages of the supplies we need because we do not have long term agreements with suppliers 
our success depends to a large degree on our ability to provide our affiliated dentists with our latw systems  and a sufficient supply of teeth whitening gels and maintenance products 
since our bs was first used commercially  we have relied upon manufacturing and supply agreements with multiple suppliers and a single manufacturer of our latw systems 
effective april  the company s latw systems are manufactured by peak industries  longmont  colorado  pursuant to an agreement between the company and peak 
we have no long term purchase contracts or other contractual assurance of continued supply  pricing or access to new products 
while we believe that we have good relationships with our suppliers and our manufacturer  if we are unable to extend or secure manufacturing services or to obtain component parts or finished products from one or more key vendors on a timely basis and on acceptable commercial terms  our results of operations could be seriously harmed 
we need to successfully manage our growth in order for the addition of any new centers and associated centers to be profitable 
our future growth primarily depends upon expansion of the number of our associated centers and centers 
we cannot assure that we will be successful in expanding the number of centers and associated centers  or that such additions will achieve sales levels satisfactory to us 
demand for the company s services and products is driven by consumers whose broad spending patterns are affected by general economic conditions 
over recent years  we have observed some variability in demand as a result of changing economic conditions  which we believe may relate to fluctuations in the level of consumer discretionary spending 
we believe that our performance will continue to be affected by such economic parameters  although our exposure to the strength of any particular economy is mitigated by our geographically diversified revenue base 
britesmile has certain debt 
britesmile had million of debt and capital leases outstanding as of december  the degree to which we are leveraged could have important consequences to the shareholders  including the following our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions or general corporate purposes may be impaired  we must pay interest on our debt  leaving less funds for other purposes  we may be at a competitive disadvantage to our less leveraged competitors  and we may be more vulnerable to a downturn in general economic conditions 
if we were to default on our debt obligations for any reason  there can be no assurance that any assets will remain for our shareholders after payment of amounts owed to debt holders 
see item management s discussion of financial condition and results of operations  liquidity and capital resources 
britesmile does not intend to pay dividends 
we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock to our shareholders for the foreseeable future 
britesmile intends to retain future earnings  if any  for use in the operation and expansion of our business 
in addition  it is possible that any debt financing agreements entered into by us in the future may contain restrictions on our ability to declare dividends 
we cannot guarantee that the patents we have applied for will be granted  or even if granted  that they will not be infringed by competitors 
we have an expansive and growing portfolio of patents to protect our intellectual property rights 
in  two patents relating to the latw systems were granted  including a patent covering a method of whitening teeth by exposing teeth treated with transparent composition including a peroxide and photosensitizing compound to light  comprising of a bleaching composition exposed to light to accelerate whitening  which have been asserted in a patent lawsuit against a major competitor  and a patent covering the light source 
we also have a number of patent applications related to the composition of our whitening gel  tissue isolation useful in light activated teeth whitening  our business method and our unique system of delivery of light to all teeth simultaneously 
we have also filed patent applications related to the britesmile to go pen 
in addition  we have ongoing research and development efforts to expand and improve our current technology  and to develop new teeth whitening compositions and light devices 
although we intend to continue to apply for patents as advised by patent counsel  there can be no assurance that such patents will be issued or that  when they are issued  they will not be infringed upon by third parties or that they will cover all aspects of the product or systems to which they relate 
the rights we rely upon to protect our intellectual property underlying our products and services may not be adequate  which could enable third parties to use our technology and would reduce our ability to compete in the market 
in addition to patents  we rely on a combination of trade secrets  copyright and trademark laws  non disclosure agreements and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our intellectual property rights 
nevertheless  these measures may not be adequate to safeguard the technology underlying our products and services 
if they do not protect our rights  third parties could use our technology  and our ability to compete in the market would be reduced 
in addition  employees  consultants and others who participate in the development of our products and services may breach their agreements with us regarding our intellectual property  and we may not have adequate remedies for the breach 
we also may not be able to effectively protect our intellectual property rights in some foreign countries 
for a variety of reasons  we may decide not to file for additional patent  copyright or trademark protection outside of the united states or in foreign jurisdictions 
we also realize that our trade secrets may become known through other means not currently foreseen by us 
notwithstanding our efforts to protect our intellectual property  our competitors may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or products that are equal or superior to our technology and products without infringing on any of our intellectual property rights or design around our proprietary technologies 
our products or services could infringe on the intellectual property rights of others  which may cause us to engage in costly litigation and  if we are not successful  could also cause us to pay substantial damages and prohibit us from selling our products or services 
third parties may assert infringement or other intellectual property claims against us 
we may have to pay substantial damages  including treble damages  for past infringement if it is ultimately determined that our products or services infringe a third party s proprietary rights 
further  we may be prohibited from selling our products before we obtain a license  which  if available at all  may require us to pay substantial royalties 
even if these claims are without merit  defending a lawsuit takes significant time  may be expensive and may divert management s attention from other business concerns 
notwithstanding the foregoing  we are not aware of any infringement claims asserted against us by others 
we are subject to government regulation regarding the corporate practice of dentistry 
our corporate structure  operation of centers and contractual relationships with the licensed dentists at our centers are subject to government regulation and may be reviewed by applicable state agencies governing the practice of dentistry such as a board of dental examiners 
we believe that our present and contemplated operation of centers is and will be in compliance in all material respects with applicable federal  state and local laws and regulations  and that favorable review of our corporate structure would be obtained from any state agency which chooses to review our operational structure 
however  we cannot assure that such favorable review would be obtained in all instances 
if we are unable to obtain favorable review  we may be subject to penalties 
further  if we are unable to comply with the applicable laws and regulations in any state  we may be limited in those states to offering our latw procedure through associated centers 
we continue to cooperate with state regulatory agencies to respond to any requests for information about our business structure and to obtain any necessary governmental approvals 
we cannot assure that future enactments  amendments or interpretations of government regulations will not be more stringent  and will not require structural  organizational or operational modifications to our existing or future contractual relationships with the licensed dentists at our centers who provide our services 
we may become subject to government regulation regarding our teeth whitening services and products 
the light used in the latw systems is categorized as a class i medical device as defined by the food and drug administration fda 
as long as the light is used specifically to perform cosmetic dental procedures teeth whitening  it is not subject to pre market notification requirements  although we are subject to fda requirements regarding handling of complaints and other general fda record keeping standards 
there can be no assurance that some or all of the existing government regulations will not change significantly or adversely in the future  or that we will not become subject to compliance with additional and stricter government regulations which could  in the future  affect our revenue 
ownership of our common stock is concentrated in a limited number of shareholders 
current directors and executive officers of the company  or their affiliates  own and control more than a majority of the outstanding common stock of the company and  therefore  have ultimate authority to make all major decisions affecting our business  including the identity and make up of the company s board of directors  and any other matters requiring approval of the shareholders of the company 
our efforts to build strong brand identity and customer loyalty may not be successful 
we believe that establishing and maintaining brand identity and brand loyalty is critical to attracting customers  dentists and other strategic partners 
in order to attract and retain these groups and respond to competitive pressures  we intend to continue substantial advertising spending to create and maintain brand loyalty
