item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company is a commercial printer  business forms manufacturer and office products and office furniture supplier in regional markets of the united states of america  east of the mississippi river 
the company has grown through strategic acquisitions and internal growth 
through such growth  the company has realized regional economies of scale  operational efficiencies  and exposure of its core products to new markets 
the company has acquired fifteen printing companies  eight office products and office furniture companies and a paper distribution division which was subsequently sold in since its initial public offering on january  the company s net revenues consist primarily of sales of commercial printing  business forms  tags  other printed products  office supplies  office furniture  data products and office design services 
the company recognizes revenues when products are shipped or ownership is transferred and when services are rendered to the customer 
the company s revenues are subject to seasonal fluctuations caused by variations in demand for its products 
the company s cost of sales primarily consists of raw materials  including paper  ink  pre press supplies and purchased office supplies  furniture and data products  and manufacturing costs including direct labor  indirect labor and overhead 
significant factors affecting the company s cost of sales include the costs of paper in both printing and office supplies  the costs of labor and other raw materials 
the company s operating costs consist of selling  general and administrative expenses 
these costs include salaries  commissions and wages for sales  customer service  accounting  administrative and executive personnel  rent  utilities  legal  audit  information systems equipment costs  software maintenance and depreciation 
critical accounting policies involving significant estimates the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
the discussion and analysis of the financial statements and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the following critical accounting policies affect the company s more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
asset impairment the company is required to test for asset impairment relating to property and equipment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset might not be recoverable 
the company applies statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets statement no 
in order to determine whether or not an asset is impaired 
this standard requires an impairment analysis when indicators of impairment are present 
if such indicators are present  the standard indicates that if the sum of the future expected cash flows from the company s asset  undiscounted and without interest charges  is less than the carrying value  an asset impairment must be recognized in the financial statements 
the amount of the impairment is the difference between the fair value of the asset and the carrying value of the asset 
the company believes that the accounting estimate related to an asset impairment is a critical accounting estimate because it is highly susceptible to change from period to period because it requires management to make assumptions about future cash flows over future years and that the impact of recognizing an impairment could have a significant effect on operations 
management s assumptions about future cash flows requires significant judgment because actual operating levels have fluctuated in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future 
management has discussed the development and selection of this critical accounting estimate with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the company s disclosure relating to it in the md a 
beginning in fiscal year  goodwill is required to be evaluated annually for impairment  according to statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
statement no 

the standard requires a two step process be performed to analyze whether or not goodwill has been impaired 
step one is to test for potential impairment  and requires that the fair value of the reporting unit be compared to its book value including goodwill 
if the fair value is higher than the book value  no impairment is recognized 
if the fair value is lower than the book value  a second step must be performed 
the second step is to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any  and requires that a hypothetical purchase price allocation be done to determine the implied fair value of goodwill 
this fair value is then compared to the carrying value of goodwill 
if the implied fair value is lower than the carrying value  an impairment must be recorded 
as discussed in the notes to the financial statements  goodwill is recorded at the adjusted book value and was analyzed for impairment with the implementation of statement no 
the fair value of the company s goodwill was estimated using discounted cash flow methodologies 
based on the analysis  the company determined that fair value relating to goodwill resulted in an implied fair value greater than the book value recorded for the corresponding goodwill  and therefore no impairment was recognized in either year since the adoption of this statement 
the company believes that the accounting estimate related to the goodwill impairment is a critical accounting estimate because the underlying assumptions used for the discounted cash flow can change from period to period and could potentially cause a material impact to the income statement 
management s assumptions about discount rates  inflation rates and other internal and external economic conditions  such as earnings growth rate  require significant judgment based on fluctuating rates and expected revenues 
additionally  statement no 
requires that the goodwill be analyzed for impairment on an annual basis using the assumptions that apply at the time the analysis is updated 
management has discussed the development of these estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 
additionally  the board of directors has reviewed this disclosure and its relation to md a 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company encounters risks associated with sales and the collection of the associated accounts receivable 
as such  the company records a monthly provision for accounts receivable that are considered to be uncollectible 
in order to calculate the appropriate monthly provision  the company primarily utilizes a historical rate of accounts receivables written off as a percentage of total revenue 
this historical rate is applied to the current revenues on a monthly basis 
the historical rate is updated periodically based on events that may change the rate such as a significant increase or decrease in collection performance and timing of payments as well as the calculated total exposure in relation to the allowance 
periodically  the company compares the identified credit risks with the allowance that has been established using historical experience and adjusts the allowance accordingly 
the company believes that the accounting estimate related to the allowance for doubtful accounts is a critical accounting estimate because the underlying assumptions used for the allowance can change from period to period and could potentially cause a material impact to the income statement and working capital 
management has discussed the development and selection of this estimate with the audit committee of the board of directors  and the board has  in turn  reviewed the disclosure and its relation to md a 
during   and   and  of bad debt expense was incurred and the allowance for doubtful accounts was   and  as of october   and the actual write offs for the periods were   and  during  and general economic conditions and specific geographic concerns are major factors that may affect the adequacy of the allowance and may result in a change in the annual bad debt expense

net income loss for reasons set forth above  net income for increased million to million  or per share on a basic and diluted basis  from a net loss of million for  or per share on a basic and diluted basis 
liquidity and capital resources as of october   the company had million of cash and cash equivalents  a decrease of million from the prior year 
working capital as of october  was million  a increase from million at october  the decrease in cash and cash equivalents is primarily attributable to a decrease in cash provided from operations due primarily to an increase of million in accounts receivable  on a net basis 
the company has historically used cash generated from operating activities and debt to finance capital expenditures and the cash portion of the purchase price of acquisitions 
management plans to continue making significant investments in equipment and to seek appropriate acquisition candidates 
however  to fund the company s continued expansion of operations  additional financing may be necessary 
the company has two available lines of credit totaling million see note of the consolidated financial statements 
for the foreseeable future including through fiscal  management believes it can fund operations  meet debt service requirements  and make the planned capital expenditures based on the available cash and cash equivalents  cash flow from operations  and lines of credit 
even though the company believes that the legal contingency see note of the consolidated financial statements that it faces will be resolved favorably  the possibility for an adverse decision on appeal is also inherent in the legal process 
the company believes that adequate liquidity is available to fund this contingency  if required 
additionally  the company has minimal amounts of future contracted obligations see note and note of the consolidated financial statements 
the company is not a guarantor of indebtedness of others 
the company has no significant off balance sheet arrangements at october  cash flows from operating activities cash flows from operating activities for the years ended october   and were million  million and million

cash flows from financing activities net cash flows used in financing activities for the years ended october    and were million  million and million 
net cash flows used in financing activities decreased in compared to due to an increase in borrowings 
dividends paid in  and were million per year 
inflation and economic conditions management believes that the effect of inflation on the company s operations has not been material and will continue to be immaterial for the foreseeable future 
the company does not have long term contracts  therefore  to the extent permitted by competition  it has the ability to pass through to its customers most cost increases resulting from inflation  if any 
in addition  the company is not particularly energy dependent  therefore  an increase in energy costs should not have a significant impact on the company 
seasonality historically  the company has experienced a greater portion of its profitability in the second and fourth quarters than in the first and third quarters 
the second quarter generally reflects increased orders for printing of corporate annual reports and proxy statements 
a post labor day increase in demand for printing services and office products coincides with the company s fourth quarter 
newly issued accounting standards see note of the consolidated financial statements item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company does not have any significant exposure relating to market risk
