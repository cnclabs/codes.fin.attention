item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading provider of sophisticated software solutions designed specifically to address the demand and supply chain management  business process  decision support  e commerce  inventory optimization  and collaborative planning and forecasting requirements of the retail industry and its suppliers 
our collaborative specific solutions enable retailers and their suppliers to optimize the sharing of plans  information and supply chain decisions between trading partners in such areas of inventory replenishment  marketing promotions  sales planning execution and category management 
we also offer maintenance services to our software customers  and enhance and support our software business by offering implementation and other services that are designed to enable our clients to rapidly achieve the benefits of our solutions 
these services include project management  system planning  system design and implementation  custom configurations  and training services 
demand for our implementation services is driven by  and often trails  sales of our software products 
consulting services revenues are generally more predictable but generate significantly lower gross margins than software license revenues 
our maintenance services revenue stream is the most predictable portion of our business and has grown in excess of in each of the last three years 
during our retention rate for maintenance customers was more than 
significant trends and developments in our business outlook for we see signs of recovery in north america and currently have a strong domestic software sales pipeline 
however  we see no broad signs of economic recovery in europe or asia pacific 
our results in the european region have also been impacted by operational issues and the departure of the regional vice president in fourth quarter we believe this situation may have an adverse impact on the sales effort in europe during the first half of we believe there are a significant number of sales opportunities that will support a sustained level of activity  however  we do not anticipate a substantial increase in software license revenues during we also believe at this time there are a limited number of outstanding prospects in the transaction system market for merchandise management systems and in store systems 
the preponderance of the business in the near term software sales pipeline continues to be for strategic merchandise management solutions 
we currently anticipate sequential increases in maintenance services revenues throughout  and we believe this revenue stream will increasingly dominate our total revenue and profitability 
we also anticipate a sequential increase in consulting service revenues in first quarter compared to fourth quarter due to the seasonal impact of the holidays on fourth quarter results 
we have taken various actions to address the profitability of our consulting services business 
we believe these changes will result in gradually improving service margins during see service revenues continue to decline and we have taken steps to improve our service margins 
other than a minor reduction in costs resulting from the changes we ve made to the incentive compensation programs of our consultants  we expect total costs and expenses for first quarter to be comparable with fourth quarter we expect to invest approximately million per quarter in product development in the first half of to complete our 
net launch initiatives 
we may adjust this spending rate in the second half of depending upon the outlook for it spending and other product specific delivery requirements 
we have reviewed the cost structure in each geographic region and are making appropriate adjustments to better match costs with anticipated revenue results during the quarter ending march  we expect to record a restructuring charge of million to million in first quarter for a workforce reduction and office closure costs 
the workforce reductions associated with this charge will be made by march  and will include approximately full time consulting  sales and product development employees in the americas  europe and asia pacific 
office closure costs pertain to certain us  canadian and european offices that were used primarily by consulting services personnel 
we purchased our corporate office facility on february  for approximately million in cash 
the purchase includes the corporate office building  a new two story parking garage  and approximately acres of land upon which these structures are located 
we believe this purchase will result in a million to million net reduction in our annual operating costs 
economic conditions continue to impact our operating results 
our operating results continue to be impacted by weak economic conditions in our international regions and the continued weakness in the retail industry 
we believe economic conditions in the americas region may have begun to recover  as our customers appear to have improved confidence and willingness to make capital expenditures for information technology 
however  the outlook for the other regions of the world remains inconsistent and we see no broad signs of improvement in europe or asia pacific 
the retail industry continues to exercise significant due diligence prior to making large capital outlays  and the decision making process for investments in information technology remains highly susceptible to deferral 
as a result  our sales cycles remain elongated and we continue to experience uncertainty predicting the size and timing of individual contracts 
for example  we signed no large software licenses million or greater in fourth quarter  as compared to four during both third and second quarter  none during first quarter  and three in fourth quarter although orders for certain of our products can be taken over the telephone  the average sales cycle for larger software license contracts can range from six months to over one year 
we continue to believe that delays in the decision making process have been  and may continue to be  the most significant issue affecting our software license revenue results 
economic conditions have negatively impacted the demand for our merchandise management systems and in store systems over the past two years and we believe there is still no evidence to support a sustained return to the historical levels of activity in the transaction systems market in the near term 
we did  however  sign three new merchandise management systems licenses in fourth quarter and five in third quarter  compared to seven and three in the fourth and third quarters of  respectively 
we believe the next drivers for growth in the transaction systems market will be sustained economic improvement  the introduction and acceptance of portfolio point of sales ppos  our java based in store system that was commercially released in second quarter  and the 
net platform version of our merchandise management systems  which is still under development  that we believe will provide our customers easier implementation of software applications in a modular format and lower total cost of ownership see we continue to invest in new product development and have expanded our markets 
industry surveys indicate that point of sales systems are becoming an increased priority for retailers 
we believe the long term prospects for our new ppos product and in store systems sales are promising  in part because we are positioned to take advantage of any replacement cycle for point of sales systems driven by a shift to new technology platforms 
our competitive environment is changing 
the pace of consolidation in our industry continues to accelerate and we believe there is a continuing trend towards fewer  larger software vendors 
as a result of this consolidation  we could face competition from large  multi industry technology companies that have historically not offered an enterprise solution set to the retail supply chain market 
we believe the jda portfolio provides a competitive advantage as it offers the broadest integrated enterprise solution set in the retail supply chain market today and the deepest functionality in any individual solution area  particularly in those functional areas that are of greatest interest to retailers in the current economic environment 
since  the majority of our software license revenues have been associated with our strategic merchandise management solutions that are less disruptive  have a higher roi and shorter implementation timeframes 
none of our competitors have a comprehensive solution set equivalent to our strategic merchandise management solutions 
we also believe existing and potential customers are exhibiting an increased desire to purchase solutions from a single vendor that provides an integrated enterprise solution set rather than dealing with multiple smaller point solution vendors 
we believe decisions to purchase information technology are currently being driven by the competitive nature of the retail industry 
as a result  we believe retailers may be taking the opportunity now to invest in technologies that will differentiate them from their competitors and position them for improved performance without significant increases in market share 
we also believe that many of our customers now view jda as a long term solution provider with the ability to provide the kind of business solutions partnership for which they re looking 
in  of our software license revenues came from existing customers compared to in we believe this trend will continue and that this metric is a direct result of our large customer base  principally amassed through our acquisition activities in and  and the focus we have and will continue to place on back selling opportunities for jda portfolio products to existing customers through our customer value program 
over the past three years  the addition of strategic merchandise management solutions such as portfolio space management by intactix and portfolio replenishment by e to the jda portfolio have provided significant back selling opportunities in our customer base 
the majority of our customers still only own one jda product 
our business segment revenue mix is changing 
the in store systems business segment provided of our total revenues in compared to in ppos  our java based in store system  was commercially released in second quarter and we are in the early adopter phase for this new platform 
we do not believe the in store systems business segment will grow until early adopters of the ppos application complete their implementations and become reference able 
industry surveys indicate that point of sales systems are becoming an increased priority for retailers 
we believe the long term prospects for our new ppos product and in store systems sales are promising  in part because we are positioned to take advantage of any replacement cycle for point of sales systems driven by a shift to new technology platforms 
in addition  we have recently supplemented this business segment with the acquisition of timera retail solutions on january  timera provides work force management and labor scheduling applications for retailers that will enhance our ability to provide efficiencies in the store environment 
scott d 
hines  our senior vice president  chief technology officer  has assumed additional responsibilities and will focus on the development of the in store systems business segment during the collaborative solutions business segment  which includes sales of software licenses and services to customers outside our traditional retail market  provided of our total revenues in compared to in our collaborative specific solutions enable retailers and their suppliers to optimize the sharing of plans  information and supply chain decisions between trading partners in such areas of inventory replenishment  marketing promotions  sales planning execution and category management 
as of december   there were approximately trading partners worldwide live and operational on our marketplace replenishment cpfr solution that enables manufacturers  distributors and retailers to work from a single  shared demand forecast 
beginning in mid  licenses on the marketplace replenishment cpfr solution have been sold on a subscription basis 
we have identified the collaborative solutions business segment as a growth area and will add a senior vice president position in specifically focused on developing this business 
service revenues continue to decline and we have taken steps to improve our service margins 
service revenues  which include consulting services  training revenues and reimbursed expenses  decreased in compared to  primarily due to a decrease in demand for the implementation of merchandise management systems and in store systems 
we believe retailers have changed their buying behavior and that this has resulted in a fundamental shift in the mix of demand for the various types of products we sell from longer  high dollar infrastructure type projects typically associated with our merchandise management systems and in store systems  to our strategic merchandise management solutions that are less disruptive  have a higher roi  shorter implementation timeframes and a lower total cost of ownership 
we also believe the average implementation times for our software products have shortened due to increased training and expertise in our consulting organization  and as a direct result of the investments we have made over the past few years to increase the functionality  stability  scalability  integration and ease of implementation of the products in the jda portfolio 
furthermore  since the majority of our product demand has been associated with our strategic merchandise management solutions that require lower levels of services to implement  and as a result  it is harder to attain optimum productivity from our consulting staff 
the preponderance of the business in the near term software sales pipeline continues to be for strategic merchandise management solutions 
we believe implementation timeframes will continue to shorten and as a result  our service organization will need to become more efficient while being deployed on multiple short projects instead of more focused longer term engagements 
service revenue margins were in compared to in the decrease resulted from decreased utilization and the resulting lower service revenues  as well as a change in our incentive compensation programs for services personnel to be related in part to software license revenue sales 
the effect of lower service revenues and higher incentive compensation on our service margins was offset in part by a decrease in average consulting services headcount  a million decrease in employee costs in compared to related to consulting services employees who were used to supplement new product development and quality assurance activities  and to assist with business development and client support activities under the customer value program  and a million decrease in occupancy costs 
we have taken various actions to address the profitability of our consulting services business 
we believe these changes will result in gradually improving service margins during specifically  we have implemented changes in the incentive compensation programs of our consultants  increased billing rates on new consulting engagements  and are in the process of restructuring the way we deliver services 
the incentive compensation program for our consultants contained annual software revenue accelerators that resulted in a higher rate of variable compensation being earned during the last half of the accelerators in compensation model are tied to quarterly rather than annual software revenue results 
this will avoid a mismatch between consulting revenues and related costs as the year progresses 
in addition  beginning in fourth quarter  we increased billing rates on new consulting engagements 
we expect our realized rates to trend upward during as we complete work under existing customer billing rate commitments 
finally  we are in the process of restructuring the way we deliver our consulting services in order to leverage web based technology 
this will allow our consultants to provide more services without the need to travel to the customer s site 
we believe this will allow customers to benefit from a reduction in their overall expenses  and reduce the disruptive aspects of today s shorter consulting projects by enabling our consultants to switch from one project to the next with less downtime 
the implementation of the customer value program impacted our operating results 
we reorganized the company in fourth quarter in connection with the implementation of the customer value program cvp effective january  implementation of the cvp caused initial disruptions in our sales  services and training functions that negatively impacted our revenues and operating results in the early months of the most significant negative impact of the cvp implementation is behind us and we believe the transition has been completed 
cvp was designed to i refocus the organization on delivering value to our existing customer base  ii strengthen our competitive position  iii improve the quality  satisfaction and efficiency of our customers experience with jda  iv increase revenues  v better align our cost structure  and vi improve our operating results 
we believe many of these goals are being met  and that the cvp may have resulted in various invitations from customers in recent quarters to participate in their strategic business development activities 
the next phase of the cvp will focus on the execution of back selling opportunities in our customer base since the majority of our customers still only own one jda product 
we recorded a million restructuring charge in fourth quarter for the workforce reduction and office closure costs to reorganize the company in connection with the implementation of the cvp 
in addition  we have incurred million in relocation costs through december   including million and  in and  respectively  to consolidate our development and client support activities at our corporate headquarters 
the relocation costs have been reported in income from continuing operations as incurred 
we continue to invest in new product development and have expanded our markets 
we invested million in  and approximately million from to in new product development and the acquisition of complementary products 
the acquisitions of intactix  zapotec  neovista decision series  e  vista  engage and timera have expanded our product offerings  and provided us with collaborative applications that address new vertical market opportunities with the manufacturers and wholesalers who supply our traditional retail customers 
we believe our strategy of expanding our product portfolio and increasing the scalability of our products has been the key element in attracting larger retail customers  and we believe that it has resulted in a steady pattern of new customers licensing multiple products  as well as enhanced back selling opportunities in our customer base 
we are developing a series of enhancements to the jda portfolio products  based upon the microsoft 
net technology platform 
net platform and the java platform  that we believe will position us uniquely in the retail and collaborative solutions markets 
our goals are to ensure that our solutions offer i increased ease of use  ii increased integration of business processes  iii reduced cost of ownership  iv faster implementation  and v faster return on investment 
we believe our next generation technology will enhance our competitive position since we will be able to offer significant features and functionality using an advanced technology platform 
our goal is to begin delivering applications on the 
net platform in third quarter  starting with portfolio replenishment by e  followed by portfolio planning by arthur  and certain of our intellect applications 
this is a significant investment by the company as we are building our next generation of products  while at the same time  we continue development efforts on our existing products and complete the integration of acquired products 
in addition  we announced the commercial availability of ppos  our java based in store system in second quarter and currently plan to deliver jda portfolio  a fully synchronized  integrated release of all our existing products  in first quarter during second quarter we announced a jda portfolio investment protection program that provides existing customers with an upgrade path to the new 
net platform  if and when available  at no additional license fee under the following conditions i licensee is a current maintenance paying customer on their existing jda applications  ii licensee is not in breach of any terms of their agreements  iii the version of the product that will run on the 
net platform has no more than minimal differences in price  features  and functionality from the licensee s existing jda applications  and iv the licensee relinquishes all rights to use previously licensed software under the terms of the platform transfer right following a reasonable transition period 
if  however  the version of the product that will run on the 
net platform has more than minimal differences in price  features  and functionality  licensee may still exercise this right provided they agree to pay an additional fee equal to the price that would be charged to other existing users of licensee s current products to migrate to the new 
net platform 
customers will pay any required third party charges associated with the new platform 
we expect to invest approximately million per quarter in product development in the first half of to complete our 
net launch initiatives 
we may adjust this spending rate in the second half of depending upon the outlook for it spending and other product specific delivery requirements 
we continue to grow our business through acquisitions 
we believe there are opportunities to grow our business through the acquisition of complementary and synergistic companies  products and technologies 
we look for acquisitions that can be readily integrated and accretive to earnings  although we may pursue smaller non accretive acquisitions that will shorten our time to market with new technologies 
we are primarily interested in acquiring solutions that will increase the breadth of our jda portfolio offerings in the in store systems and collaborative solutions business segments  and believe the general size of cash acquisitions we would currently consider to be in the million to million range 
in april we acquired substantially all the intellectual property of vista software solutions  inc vista  and vista s active customer agreements for a total cost of million  which includes the purchase price of million plus  in direct costs of the acquisition 
vista is a provider of collaborative business to business software solutions that enable retailers and consumer goods manufacturers to more efficiently synchronize and integrate data  including product descriptions  product images  pricing and promotion information throughout their supply and demand chains 
vista s solutions also enable consumer goods manufacturers to manage trade promotions  minimize trade deductions costs and more accurately forecast product demand 
with this acquisition  we have expanded the jda portfolio with complementary software products that leverage the microsoft 
net platform and address the critical need for server to server data synchronization in internet based collaborative commerce

in connection with the vista acquisition  we added new employees  primarily in product development  and recorded  of goodwill in our retail enterprise systems reporting unit  million of goodwill in our collaborative solutions reporting unit  million in software technology  and million for customer lists and other intangibles

software license revenues for decreased to million from million in retail enterprise systems software license revenues decreased in compared to we believe this business segment was negatively impacted in the first half of by the disruption caused by our reorganization under the cvp  the elongation of sales cycles due to heightened risk aversion by retailers for larger it expenditures  and worldwide concerns about the economy and the war in iraq which disrupted it spending patterns 
some of these factors have diminished  and software license sales in the retail enterprise systems business segment increased in the second half of compared to the second half of in store systems software license revenues decreased in compared to we believe this business segment has been negatively impacted by a major platform transition  as market demand moves from window based point of sale applications to java based point of sale applications 
we commercially released our ppos java based point of sale application in second quarter and we are currently in the early adopter phase for this new platform 
we believe the long term prospects for this business segment are promising  in part because we are positioned to take advantage of any replacement cycle for point of sales systems driven by a shift to new technology platforms 
in addition  we have recently supplemented this business segment with the acquisition of timera retail solutions on january  timera provides work force management and labor scheduling applications for retailers that will enhance our ability to provide efficiencies in the store environment 
collaborative solutions software license revenues decreased in compared to although we experienced a decline in initial license fees in this business segment in  we began selling subscriptions on certain of our cpfr solutions and our subscription customer base increased to approximately trading partners at december  compared to at december  we believe the long term prospects for this business segment will be enhanced by the additional collaborative applications acquired from vista and the introduction of merchandise planning and category management solutions for suppliers to retail 
software license revenues in the americas increased to million in compared to million in  as a increase in retail enterprise systems software license revenues was offset by decreases in software license revenues related to in store systems and collaborative solutions applications of and  respectively

this asia pacific region has been impacted by a slow economic recovery and the sars outbreak in early maintenance services 
maintenance services revenue increased to million in from million in  primarily due to increases in the customer base for strategic merchandise management solutions 
in addition  the increase includes  and  in incremental maintenance services revenue from the vista and engage acquisitions  respectively 
maintenance services revenue increased in our retail enterprise systems and collaborative solutions business segments due to continued increases in our install base 
maintenance services revenue decreased in our in store systems business segment due to attrition that we believe results from the transitional period surrounding the introduction and acceptance of ppos  our java based in store system 
many of our in store systems customers have developed their own internal support teams 
we believe a portion of these customers have opted to discontinue maintenance and remain on their existing systems in the near term  rather than incur potentially large system upgrade  training and hardware costs at this time 
service revenues service revenues  which include consulting services  training revenues  and reimbursed expenses  decreased to million in compared to million in  primarily due to a decrease in demand for the implementation of merchandise management systems and in store systems which typically have higher implementation requirements than our strategic merchandise management solutions

we have taken steps to improve our service revenue margins in  including revisions to the incentive compensation programs  increased billing rates on new consulting engagements  and restructuring the way we deliver our consulting services in order to leverage web based technology and enhance productivity

software license revenues for decreased to million from million in excluding the impact of owning e for eight more months in than in  software license revenues decreased in compared to the retail industry appeared to remain cautious with their level of investment in information technology during the difficult economic cycle we experienced in  perhaps due to poor macroeconomic conditions  and uncertainty related to the threat of future terrorist attacks and a us war with iraq 
in addition  subsequent to the september attack and the ensuing deterioration in economic conditions  we believe retailers changed their buying behavior and this resulted in a fundamental shift in the mix of demand for the various types of products we sell away from high dollar projects toward lower cost point solutions 
software license revenues in the retail enterprise systems business segment  excluding the impact of owning e for eight more months in than in  decreased in compared to in store systems software license revenues decreased in compared to collaborative solutions software license revenues  excluding the impact of owning e for eight more months in than in  decreased in compared to software license revenues in the americas decreased in compared to excluding the impact of owning e for eight more months in than in  software license revenues in the americas decreased in compared to this decrease resulted primarily from a decrease in software license revenues related to retail enterprise systems and a decrease in in store systems applications  offset in part by a increase in software license revenues from our collaborative solutions products

consulting services consulting services revenue  including the reclassification of reimbursed expenses  decreased in to million from million in excluding the impact of owning e for eight more months in than in  consulting services revenue decreased in compared to  primarily due to a decrease in demand for the implementation of merchandise management systems and other large projects 
consulting services revenue typically lags the sale of software licenses by as much as one year 
in addition  we believe the average implementation times for our software products declined due to increased training and expertise in our consulting organization  and as a direct result of the investments we made over the past few years to increase the functionality  stability  scalability  integration and ease of implementation of the products in the jda portfolio 
furthermore  in more of the demand for our products was associated with our analytic and optimization products that require lower levels of services to implement 
as a result of these changes in our business and product revenue mix  our consulting services revenue declined sequentially in each of the four fiscal quarters of business segment revenues total revenues in our retail enterprise systems business segment decreased to million in from million in excluding the impact of owning e for eight more months in than in  total revenues in this business segment decreased in compared to  primarily due to a decline in demand for merchandise management systems 
sales of merchandise management systems tend to be more heavily impacted during slow economic periods  as retailers are often reluctant to make substantial investments due to the slower expected return on investment 
in addition  these products typically have longer implementation time frames and our services group often performs the implementation services 
as a result  the decline in software sales for these products also had a negative impact on our consulting services revenue 
the retail enterprise systems business segment represented of our total revenues in compared to in total revenues in our in store systems business segment decreased to million in from million in  primarily due to a decrease in win dss revenues  offset in part by a increase in revenues from the store portal application

cost of maintenance services increased to million  or of maintenance services revenue  in from million  or of maintenance services revenue  in the increase resulted primarily from the acquisition of e in september and the additional headcount in the customer support function to support our growing installed client base  offset in part by lower incentive compensation costs

cost of services cost of services decreased to million in from million in this decrease resulted primarily from a decrease in average consulting services headcount and lower incentive compensation costs in compared to  offset in part by higher travel and training costs 
at december   we had employees in the consulting services function 
gross profit gross profit for increased to million  or of total revenues  from million  or of total revenues in the increase in gross profit dollars and gross margin percentage resulted primarily from the increase in total revenues and the higher mix of product revenues as a percentage of total revenues in compared to software licenses and maintenance services revenue have higher margins than service revenues 
consulting services margins  which include the reclassification of reimbursed expenses in both service revenues and cost of service revenues  remained flat at in compared to as the impact of the decrease in average consulting services headcount  lower incentive compensation costs and higher average billing rates in compared to were offset by lower utilization rates 
the lower utilization rates in resulted from deteriorating economic conditions that decreased the demand for our services  particularly from merchandise management systems implementations and other large projects  together with improved integration and shorter implementation timeframes of the products in the jda portfolio 
during second quarter we reduced our consulting services headcount by approximately in order to stem the decline in our utilization rates  consulting margins and overall profitability with the lower consulting services revenue outlook for during fourth quarter we reduced our consulting services headcount by another in connection with our reorganization and restructuring of the company see the implementation of the customer value program has impacted our operating results

we also believe development of our software is essentially completed concurrent with the establishment of technological feasibility  and accordingly  no costs have been capitalized 
at december   we had employees in the product development function 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses for increased to million from million in sales and marketing expense as a percentage of total revenues was in  which is comparable to the increase in sales and marketing expenses resulted from an increase in quota carrying sales representatives  due primarily to the acquisition of e in september  and higher marketing and travel costs  offset in part by lower commissions and related benefits

restructuring  asset disposition and other merger related charges 
we consistently monitor the impact of the economic environment on the outlook for demand for our products and services  and make adjustments to our workforce as necessary to maintain overall profitability 
in second quarter  we recorded a million restructuring charge for a workforce reduction of full time employees  primarily in the consulting services function in the americas and europe 
all employees potentially impacted by this restructuring were notified of the plan of termination and the related benefits on or before june  in fourth quarter  we recorded another restructuring charge of million for termination and office closure costs associated with the reorganization of the company to implement the cvp initiative 
all employees potentially impacted by this reorganization initiative were notified of the plan of termination and the related benefits on or before december  office closure costs pertain to certain us  latin america  and european offices that were either under performing or became redundant with the relocation initiatives 
we recorded restructuring  asset disposition and other merger related charges of  in first quarter and an additional  in fourth quarter for jda employees made redundant in the e acquisition 
these restructuring initiatives involved a workforce reduction of full time employees in certain implementation service groups  product development activities  sales and marketing  and administrative functions in the united states  europe  canada and latin america

the first quarter charges also include other merger related charges of  for the write off of certain merger and acquisition costs related to a potential acquisition that was abandoned 
relocation costs to consolidate development and support activities 
we incurred  in costs through december   in connection with cvp  to relocate certain product development and client support services employees based in offices around the united states and the united kingdom to our corporate headquarters

provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes was million  or of income before income taxes in compared to million  or in the provision for income taxes for includes million in one time tax benefits related primarily to the resolution of an audit by the inland revenue of our united kingdom subsidiaries for the years through  and the settlement in the united states of an income tax examination by the internal revenue service of our and federal income tax returns 
under the settlement  the internal revenue service agreed to allow the company to take a research and development expense tax credit for most of the qualifying expenses originally reported in the company s corporate income tax returns for those years 
our effective income tax rate takes into account the source of taxable income  domestically by state and internationally by country  and available income tax credits 
the provisions for income taxes for and do not include the tax benefits realized from employee stock options exercised during these years of million net of a million valuation allowance  and  respectively 
these tax benefits reduce our income tax liabilities and are included as an increase to additional paid in capital 
during  we established a valuation allowance of million on foreign tax credit carryovers because we had been operating in an excess credit position 
we charged million of this valuation allowance to additional paid in capital due to the potential loss of foreign tax credits from the exercise of employee stock options 
we feel it is more likely than not that foreign tax credits will not be realized 
if  in the future  the company determines that it is able to utilize the foreign tax credits  a portion of the valuation allowance reversal will be recorded to additional paid in capital 
liquidity and capital resources we had working capital of million at december  compared with million at december  cash and marketable securities at december  were million  an increase of million over the million reported at december  cash and marketable securities balances increased in primarily as a result of cash provided by operating activities and the cash received from the issuance of common stock under our stock option and employee stock purchase plans 
working capital remained flat at december  compared to december  primarily as a result of the increase in cash and marketable securities  an increase in the current portion of a promissory note receivable  and a reduction in accrued expenses and other liabilities  offset by a decrease in accounts receivable and income tax receivable  and an increase in deferred revenue 
our net accounts receivable were million  or days sales outstanding dsos at december  compared to million  or dsos at december  dsos may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis due to a number of factors including seasonality  shifts in customer buying patterns  the timing of annual maintenance renewals  lengthened contractual payment terms in response to competitive pressures  the underlying mix of products and services  and the geographic concentration of revenues 
the significant decrease in accounts receivable balances is due primarily to lower revenues in compared to however  collection of accounts receivable continues to be an area of focus and the amounts outstanding greater than days have decreased more than million since december  operating activities provided cash of million in and million in the decrease in cash provided from operating activities results primarily from i a decrease in total revenues that resulted in a million decrease in net income in compared to  ii a million decrease in the income tax benefits from the exercise of stock options and shares purchased under the employee stock purchase plan as the average market price of our stock was lower in compared to which resulted in fewer options being exercised  iii a  decrease in deferred revenue in compared to a million increase in which resulted primarily from the first full year billing of maintenance on products acquired from e  iv a million smaller decrease in accounts receivable which resulted from lower total revenues and improved collections  v a million decrease in accrued expenses and other liabilities compared to a million increase in  and vi a million lower provision for doubtful accounts 
these decreases in cash flow were partially offset by i a million decrease in income tax receivable in compared to a million increase in  ii a million decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets in compared to a million increase in  and iii a  smaller decrease in deferred income taxes due primarily to our election to capitalize a significant portion of our research and development costs for on our federal income tax return 
investing activities utilized cash of million in and million in cash utilized by investing activities in results primarily from million in capital expenditures which includes approximately million in costs related to the implementation of a new enterprise wide customer support system  the net purchase of million of marketable securities due to our investment of cash in excess of current operating requirements  million in cash expended to acquire vista and pay direct costs related to the acquisition  and million in cash expended to acquire engage and pay direct costs related to the acquisition  offset in part by million in proceeds from the disposal of property and equipment  primarily from the sale of an excess office facility in the united kingdom 
cash utilized by investing activities in includes the net purchase of million of marketable securities  the payment of million in direct costs related to the acquisition of e  million in cash expended to acquire j commerce  and million in capital expenditures 
financing activities provided cash of million in and million in the activity in both periods includes proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our stock option and employee stock purchase plans 
proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our stock option plans decreased million in as the average market price of our stock was lower in compared to  which resulted in fewer options being exercised 
we received approximately million in proceeds from the issuance of stock under our employee stock purchase plan purchase plan in both and this source of cash will not recur in as we terminated the purchase plan in august in addition  in july our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to two million shares of our outstanding common stock on the open market at prevailing market prices during a one year period ended july  we repurchased a total of  shares of our common stock for million under this program  including  shares for  in and  shares for million in changes in the currency exchange rates of our foreign operations had the effect of increasing cash by million in and million in due to the continued weakness of the us dollar against major foreign currencies including the euro and the british pound 
we currently use derivative financial instruments  primarily forward exchange contracts  to manage a majority of the short term foreign currency exchange exposure associated with foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities which exist as part of our ongoing business operations 
we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the forward exchange contracts generally have maturities of less than days  and are not designated as hedging instruments under sfas no 
forward exchange contracts are marked to market at the end of each reporting period  with gains and losses recognized in other income  net  offset by the gains or losses resulting from the settlement of the underlying foreign currency denominated receivables and payables 
we believe there are opportunities to grow our business through the acquisition of complementary and synergistic companies  products and technologies 
we look for acquisitions that can be readily integrated and accretive to earnings  although we may pursue smaller non accretive acquisitions that will shorten our time to market with new technologies 
we are primarily interested in acquiring solutions that will increase the breadth of our jda portfolio offerings in the in store systems and collaborative solutions business segments  and believe the general size of cash acquisitions we would currently consider to be in the million to million range 
any material acquisition could result in a decrease to our working capital depending on the amount  timing and nature of the consideration to be paid 
in addition  any material acquisitions of complementary or synergistic companies  products or technologies could require that we obtain additional equity financing 
there can be no assurance that such additional financing will be available or that  if available  such financing will be obtained on terms favorable to us and would not result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
on january  we acquired the intellectual property and certain other assets of timera retail solutions timera  for a total cost of million  which includes the purchase price of million plus million in direct costs of the acquisition 
the acquisition will be accounted for as a purchase  and accordingly  the operating results of timera will be included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition 
in connection with the timera acquisition  we have extended employment offers to former timera employees  approximately two thirds of which are in product development 
the final purchase price allocation has not been completed  however we currently expect to record approximately million of goodwill  million in software technology  and million for customer lists 
pro forma operating results will not be presented as the acquisition is not material to our consolidated financial statements 
subsequent to december   we purchased our corporate office facility for approximately million in cash 
this transaction closed on february  the purchase includes the corporate office building  a new two story parking garage  and approximately acres of land upon which these structures are located 
we believe this purchase will result in a million to million net reduction in our annual operating costs 
the purchase of our corporate office facility  together with the acquisition of timera  utilized million  or approximately of our december  cash and cash equivalents  and investments in marketable securities balances 
the following summarizes known contractual obligations under capital and operating leases as of december  payment due by period contractual obligations total years in thousands capital lease obligations operating lease obligations      capital lease obligations are included in accrued expenses and other liabilities 
operating lease obligations represent future minimum lease payments under noncancellable operating leases with minimum or remaining lease terms in excess of one year at december   and excludes million in scheduled minimum lease payments on our corporate office facility that we purchased on february  we believe our cash and cash equivalents  investments in marketable securities  and net cash provided from operations will provide adequate liquidity to meet our normal operating requirements for at least the next twelve months 
a major component of our positive cash flow is the collection of accounts receivable 
the collection of accounts receivable continues to be an area of focus and we have tightened up our credit authorization procedures 
further  we invest our excess cash in short term  interest bearing instruments that have a low risk of capital loss  such as us government securities  commercial paper and corporate bonds  and money market securities 
commercial paper must be rated by of the nationally recognized statistical rating organizations 
corporate bonds must be rated aa or aa or better by moody s and s p  respectively 
critical accounting policies we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
the preparation of this annual report on form k requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition 
our revenue recognition policy is significant because our revenue is a key component of our results of operations 
in addition  our revenue recognition determines the timing of certain expenses such as commissions and royalties 
we follow specific and detailed guidelines in measuring revenue  however  certain judgments affect the application of our revenue policy 
we license software under non cancelable agreements and provide related services  including consulting  training and customer support 
we recognize revenue in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended and interpreted by statement of position  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions  as well as technical practice aids issued from time to time by the american institute of certified public accountants  and staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements  that provides further interpretive guidance for public companies on the recognition  presentation  and disclosure of revenue in financial statements 
software license revenue is recognized when a license agreement has been signed  the software product has been delivered  there are no uncertainties surrounding product acceptance  the fees are fixed and determinable  and collection is considered probable 
if a software license contains an undelivered element  the vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value of the undelivered element is deferred and the revenue recognized once the element is delivered 
the undelivered elements are primarily training  consulting and maintenance services 
vsoe of fair value for training and consulting services is based upon hourly rates charged when those services are sold separately 
vsoe of fair value for maintenance is the price the customer will be required to pay when it is sold separately that is  the renewal rate 
in addition  if a software license contains customer acceptance criteria or a cancellation right  the software revenue is recognized upon the earlier of customer acceptance or the expiration of the acceptance period or cancellation right 
payments for our software licenses are typically due in installments within twelve months from the date of delivery 
although infrequent  where software license agreements call for payment terms of twelve months or more from the date of delivery  revenue is recognized as payments become due and all other conditions for revenue recognition have been satisfied 
consulting and training services are separately priced  are generally available from a number of suppliers  and are not essential to the functionality of our software products 
consulting services  which include project management  system planning  design and implementation  customer configurations  and training are billed on both an hourly basis and under fixed price contracts 
consulting services revenue billed on an hourly basis is recognized as the work is performed 
training revenues are recognized when the training is provided and is included in consulting revenues in the company s consolidated statements of income 
under fixed price contracts  consulting services revenue is recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting by relating hours incurred to date to total estimated hours at completion 
we have from time to time provided software and consulting services under fixed price contracts that require the achievement of certain milestones  and the payment terms in these contracts are generally tied to customer acceptance of the milestones 
the revenue under such arrangements is recognized as the milestones are achieved or upon customer acceptance 
we believe that milestones are a proper measure of progress under these contracts  as the milestones approximate the percentage of completion method of accounting 
customer support services include post contract support and the rights to unspecified upgrades and enhancements 
maintenance revenues from ongoing customer support services are billed on a monthly basis and recorded as revenue in the applicable month  or on an annual basis with the revenue being deferred and recognized ratably over the maintenance period 
if an arrangement includes multiple elements  the fees are allocated to the various elements based upon vsoe of fair value  as described above 
accounts receivable 
consistent with industry practice and to be competitive in the retail software marketplace  we typically provide installment payment terms on most software license sales 
software licenses are generally due in installments within twelve months from the date of delivery 
all significant customers are reviewed for creditworthiness before the company licenses its software and we do not sell our software or recognize any license revenue unless we believe that collection is probable in accordance with the requirements of paragraph in sop we have a history of collecting software payments when they come due without providing refunds or concessions 
consulting services are generally billed bi weekly and maintenance services are billed annually or monthly 
if a customer becomes significantly delinquent or its credit deteriorates  we put the accounts on hold and do not recognize any further services revenue and in most cases we withdraw support and or our implementation staff until the situation has been resolved 
we do not have significant billing or collection problems 
we review each past due account and provide specific reserves based upon the information we gather from various sources including our customers  subsequent cash receipts  consulting services project teams  members of each region s management  and credit rating services such as dun and bradstreet 
although infrequent and unpredictable  from time to time certain of our customers have filed bankruptcy and we have been required to refund the pre petition amounts collected and settle for less than the face value of their remaining receivable pursuant to a bankruptcy court order 
in these situations  as soon as it becomes probable that the net realizable value of the receivable is impaired  we provide reserves on the receivable 
in addition  we monitor economic conditions in the various geographic regions in which we operate to determine if general reserves or adjustments to our credit policy in a region are appropriate for deteriorating conditions that may impact the net realizable value of our receivables 
intangible assets 
our business combinations typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets  which affects the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment expense that we will incur 
the determination of the value of such intangible assets and the annual impairment tests require management to make estimates of future revenues  customer retention rates and other assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements 
product development 
the costs to develop new software products and enhancements to existing software products are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been established 
we consider technological feasibility to have occurred when all planning  designing  coding and testing have been completed according to design specifications 
once technological feasibility is established  any additional costs would be capitalized 
we believe our current process for developing software is essentially completed concurrent with the establishment of technological feasibility  and accordingly  no costs have been capitalized income taxes 
our income tax policy records the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets  as well as operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
we follow specific and detailed guidelines regarding the recoverability of any tax assets recorded on the balance sheet and provide any necessary allowances as required 
stock based compensation 
we do not record compensation expense for options granted to our employees as all options granted under our stock option plans have an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant

 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 

the provisions of sfas no 
amend and clarify the accounting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities under sfas no 
sfas no 
is effective for contracts entered into or modified after june  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a significant impact on our financial statements 
we did not engage in any material foreign currency hedging transactions during  however  during fourth quarter we began using derivative financial instruments  primarily forward exchange contracts  to manage a majority of the foreign currency exchange exposure associated with the net short term foreign denominated assets and liabilities which exist as part of our ongoing business operations 
the exposures relate primarily to the gain or loss recognized in earnings from the revaluation or settlement of current foreign denominated assets and liabilities 
we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the forward exchange contracts generally have maturities of less than days  and are not designated as hedging instruments under sfas no 
forward exchange contracts are marked to market at the end of each reporting period  with gains and losses recognized in other income  net  offset by the gains or losses resulting from the settlement of the underlying foreign denominated assets and liabilities

 that have characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
factors that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock we operate in a dynamic and rapidly changing environment that involves numerous risks and uncertainties 
the following section describes some  but not all  of these risks and uncertainties that we believe may adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
this section should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto  and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations as of december  and for the year then ended contained elsewhere in this form k 
regional and or global changes in economic  political and market conditions could cause decreases in demand for our software and related services which could negatively affect our revenue and operating results and the market price of our stock 
our revenue and profitability depend on the overall demand for our software and related services 
a regional and or global change in the economy and financial markets could result in delay or cancellation of customer purchases 
we and most of our competitors recently announced that current economic conditions have negatively impacted financial results 
in addition  recent developments associated with terrorist attacks on united states interests  the us war and continued violence in iraq  and the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars have resulted in economic  political and other uncertainties  which could further adversely affect our revenue growth and operating results 
if demand for our software and related services decrease  our revenues would decrease and our operating results would be adversely affected 
our inability to license software products to new customers may cause our stock price to fall 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly  which could adversely affect the price of our stock 
our quarterly operating results have varied and are expected to continue to vary in the future 
if our quarterly operating results fail to meet management s or analysts expectations  the price of our stock could decline 
many factors may cause these fluctuations  including demand for our software products and services  including the size and timing of individual contracts and our ability to recognize revenue with respect to contracts signed in the quarter  particularly with respect to our significant customers  changes in the length of our sales cycle  competitive pricing pressures and the competitive success or failure on significant transactions  customer order deferrals resulting from the anticipation of new products  economic uncertainty  disappointing operating results by the customer  or otherwise  the timing of new software product and technology introductions and enhancements to our software products or those of our competitors  and market acceptance of our new software products and technology  changes in our operating expenses  changes in the mix of domestic and international revenues  or expansion or contraction of international operations  our ability to complete fixed price consulting contracts within budget  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  operational issues resulting from corporate reorganizations  and lower than anticipated utilization in our consulting services group as a result of reduced levels of software sales  reduced implementation times for our products  changes in the mix of demand for our software products  or other reasons 
our stock price has been and may remain volatile 
the trading price of our common stock has in the past and may in the future be subject to wide fluctuations 
examples of factors that we believe have caused fluctuations in our stock price in the past include the following cancelled or delayed purchasing decisions related to the september terrorist attack and the uncertainty related to potential future terrorist attacks and the war with and continued violence in iraq  the millennium change  conversion to the euro currency  external and internal marketing issues  our announcement of our reduced visibility and increased uncertainty concerning future demand for our products  increased competition  elongated sales cycles  a limited number of reference accounts with implementations in the early years of product release  certain design and stability issues in early versions of our products  and lack of desired features and functionality 
in addition  fluctuations in the price of our common stock may expose us to the risk of securities class action lawsuits 
defending against such lawsuits could result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources 
furthermore  any settlement or adverse determination of these lawsuits could subject us to significant liabilities 
our gross margins may vary significantly or decline 
because the gross margins on product revenues software licenses and maintenance services are significantly greater than the gross margins on consulting services revenue  our combined gross margin has fluctuated from quarter to quarter  and it may continue to fluctuate significantly based on revenue mix 
as a result of the economic downturn  we believe retailers have changed their buying behavior and that this has resulted in a fundamental shift in the mix of demand for the various types of products we sell 
demand for our merchandise management systems and in store systems has declined 
we believe retailers have changed their buying behavior and that this has resulted in a fundamental shift in the mix of demand for the various types of products we sell from longer  high dollar infrastructure type projects typically associated with our merchandise management systems and in store systems  to our strategic merchandise management solutions that are less disruptive  have a higher roi  shorter implementation timeframes and a lower total cost of ownership 
the decline in software sales of merchandise management systems and in store systems is having a corollary negative impact on our service revenues as consulting services revenue typically lags the performance of software revenues by as much as one year 
in addition  our gross margins on consulting services revenue vary significantly with the rates at which we utilize our consulting personnel  and as a result  our overall gross margins will be adversely affected when there is not enough work to keep our consultants busy 
we may face some constraints on our ability to adjust consulting service headcount and expense to meet demand  due in part to our need to retain consulting personnel with sufficient skill sets to implement and maintain our full set of products 
we may misjudge when software sales will be realized 
software license revenues in any quarter depend substantially upon contracts signed and the related shipment of software in that quarter 
it is therefore difficult for us to accurately predict software license revenues 
because of the timing of our sales  we typically recognize the substantial majority of our software license revenues in the last weeks or days of the quarter  and we may derive a significant portion of our quarterly software license revenues from a small number of relatively large sales 
in addition  it is difficult to forecast the timing of large individual software license sales with a high degree of certainty due to the extended length of the sales cycle and the generally more complex contractual terms that may be associated with such licenses that could result in the deferral of some or all of the revenue to future periods 
accordingly  large individual sales have sometimes occurred in quarters subsequent to when we anticipated 
we expect these aspects of our business to continue 
if we receive any significant cancellation or deferral of customer orders  or we are unable to conclude license negotiations by the end of a fiscal quarter  our operating results may be lower than anticipated 
in addition  any weakening or uncertainty in the economy may make it more difficult for us to predict quarterly results in the future  and could negatively impact our business  operating results and financial condition for an indefinite period of time 
we may not be able to reduce expense levels if our revenues decline 
our expense levels are based on our expectations of future revenues 
since software license sales are typically accompanied by a significant amount of consulting and maintenance services  the size of our services organization must be managed to meet our anticipated software license revenues 
as a result  we hire and train service personnel and incur research and development costs in advance of anticipated software license revenues 
if software license revenues fall short of our expectations  or if we are unable to fully utilize our service personnel  our operating results are likely to decline because a significant portion of our expenses cannot be quickly reduced to respond to any unexpected revenue shortfall 
we are dependent upon the retail industry 
historically  we have derived or more of our revenues from the license of software products and the performance of related services to retail customers 
although the acquisitions of arthur  intactix  zapotec  neovista decision series  e  vista and engage have expanded our product offerings to provide collaborative applications that address new vertical market opportunities with the manufacturers and wholesalers who supply our traditional retail customers  our future growth is critically dependent on increased sales to retail customers 
the success of our customers is directly linked to economic conditions in the retail industry  which in turn are subject to intense competitive pressures and are affected by overall economic conditions 
in addition  we believe that the licensing of certain of our software products involves a large capital expenditure  which is often accompanied by large scale hardware purchases or other capital commitments 
as a result  demand for our products and services could decline in the event of instability or potential downturns 
we believe the retail industry remains cautious with their level of investment in information technology during the difficult economic cycle of the last few years  and uncertainty related to the threat of future terrorist attacks and any continued violence in iraq 
we remain concerned about weak and uncertain economic conditions  consolidations and the disappointing results of retailers in certain of our geographic regions 
the retail industry will be negatively impacted if weak economic conditions or fear of additional terrorists attacks and wars persist for an extended period of time 
weak and uncertain economic conditions have in the past  and may in the future  negatively impact our revenues  including a potential deterioration of our maintenance revenue base as customers look to reduce their costs  elongate our selling cycles  and delay  suspend or reduce the demand for our products 
as a result  it is difficult in the current economic environment to predict exactly when specific software licenses will close within a six to nine month time frame 
in addition  weak and uncertain economic conditions could impair our customers ability to pay for our products or services 
any of these factors could adversely impact our business  quarterly or annual operating results and financial condition 
we also believe that the retail industry may be consolidating  and that the industry is currently experiencing increased competition in certain geographical regions that could negatively impact the industry and our customers ability to pay for our products and services 
such consolidation has in the past  and may in the future  negatively impact our revenues  reduce the demand for our products and may negatively impact our business  operating results and financial condition 
there may be an increase in customer bankruptcies due to weak economic conditions 
we have in the past and may in the future be impacted by customer bankruptcies that occur in periods subsequent to the software license sale 
during weak economic conditions  such as those currently being experienced in our international regions  there is an increased risk that certain of our customers will file bankruptcy 
when our customers file bankruptcy  we may be required to forego collection of pre petition amounts owed and to repay amounts remitted to us during the day preference period preceding the filing 
accounts receivable balances related to pre petition amounts may in certain of these instances be large due to extended payment terms for software license fees  and significant billings for consulting and implementation services on large projects 
the bankruptcy laws  as well as the specific circumstances of each bankruptcy  may severely limit our ability to collect pre petition amounts  and may force us to disgorge payments made during the day preference period 
we also face risk from international customers that file for bankruptcy protection in foreign jurisdictions  in that the application of foreign bankruptcy laws may be more difficult to predict 
although we believe that we have sufficient reserves to cover anticipated customer bankruptcies  there can be no assurance that such reserves will be adequate  and if they are not adequate  our business  operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected 
we may have difficulty attracting and retaining skilled personnel 
our success is heavily dependent upon our ability to attract  hire  train  retain and motivate skilled personnel  including sales and marketing representatives  qualified software engineers involved in ongoing product development  and consulting personnel who assist in the implementation of our products and services 
the market for such individuals is competitive 
for example  it may be particularly difficult to attract and retain product development personnel experienced in the microsoft 
net platform since the 
net platform is a new and evolving technology 
given the critical roles of our sales  product development and consulting staffs  our inability to recruit successfully or any significant loss of key personnel would hurt us 
a high level of employee mobility and aggressive recruiting of skilled personnel characterize the software industry 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to retain our current personnel  attract and retain other highly qualified technical and managerial personnel in the future  or be able to assimilate the employees from any acquired businesses 
we will continue to adjust the size and composition of the workforce in our services organization to match the different product and geographic demand cycles 
if we were unable to attract and retain the necessary technical and managerial personnel  or assimilate the employees from any acquired businesses  our business  operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected 
we have only deployed certain of our software products on a limited basis  and have not yet deployed some software products that are important to our future growth 
certain of our software products  including customer ordering  store portal  portfolio point of sales  and certain modules of portfolio crm and intellect  have been commercially released within the last two years 
other modules of portfolio crm and intellect are still in beta or under development 
in addition  we have only recently announced our intentions to develop or acquire a series of business to business e commerce solutions  including products in furtherance of our pursuit of the market for collaborative solutions 
the markets for these products are new and evolving  and we believe that retailers and their suppliers may be cautious in adopting web based and other new technologies 
consequently  we cannot predict the growth rate  if any  and size of the markets for our e commerce products or that these markets will continue to develop 
potential and existing customers may find it difficult  or be unable  to successfully implement our e commerce products  or may not purchase our products for a variety of reasons  including their inability or unwillingness to deploy sufficient internal personnel and computing resources for a successful implementation 
in addition  we must overcome significant obstacles to successfully market our newer products  including limited experience of our sales and consulting personnel 
if the markets for our newer products fail to develop  develop more slowly or differently than expected or become saturated with competitors  or if our products are not accepted in the marketplace or are technically flawed  our business  operating results and financial condition will decline 
we are investing heavily in re writing many of our products for the microsoft 
net platform 
we are developing a series of enhancements to the jda portfolio products  based upon the microsoft 
net technology platform 
net platform  that we believe will position us uniquely in the retail and collaborative solutions markets 
our goals are to ensure that our solutions offer i increased ease of use  ii increased integration of business processes  iii reduced cost of ownership  iv faster implementation  and v faster return on investment 
we believe our next generation technology will enhance our competitive position since we will be able to offer significant features and functionality using an advanced technology platform 
our goal is to begin delivering applications on the 
net platform in third quarter  starting with portfolio replenishment by e  followed by portfolio planning by arthur  and certain of our intellect applications 
this is a significant investment by the company as we are building our next generation of products  while at the same time  we continue development efforts on our existing products and complete the integration of acquired products 
we also plan to develop new products as well as shared code components using the 
net platform 
the risks of our commitment to the 
net platform include  but are not limited to  the following the possibility that it may be more difficult than we currently anticipate to develop our products for the 
net platform  and we could incur costs in excess of our projections to complete the planned transition of our product suite  the possibility that prospective customers will refrain from purchasing the current versions of products to be re written because they are waiting for the 
net platform versions  the possibility that our 
net platform beta customers will not become favorable reference sites  adequate scalability of the 
net platform for our largest customers  the possibility we may not complete the transition to the 
net platform in the time frame we currently expect  the ability of our development staff to learn how to efficiently and effectively develop products using the 
net platform  our ability to transition our customer base onto the 
net platform when it is available  microsoft s ability to achieve market acceptance of the 
net platform  and microsoft s continued commitment to enhancing and marketing the 
net platform 
despite efforts to mitigate the risks of the 
net platform project  there can be no assurances that our efforts to re write many of our current products and to develop new products using the 
net platform will be successful 
if the 
net platform project is not successful  it likely will have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
moreover  we cannot assure you that  even if we successfully re write our products on the 
net platform  our re written products will achieve market acceptance 
we may introduce new lines of business where we are less experienced 
we may introduce new lines of business that are outside our traditional focus on software licenses and related maintenance and implementation services 
introducing new lines of business involves a number of uncertainties  including a lack of internal resources and expertise to operate and grow such new lines of business  immature internal processes and controls  inexperience predicting revenues and expenses for the new lines of business  and the possibility that such new lines of business will divert management attention and resources from our traditional business 
the inability of management to effectively develop and operate these new lines of business could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
moreover  we may not be able gain acceptance of any new lines of business in our markets  penetrate new markets successfully  or obtain the anticipated or desired benefits of such new lines of business 
there are many risks associated with international operations 
our international revenues represented of total revenues in the year ended december  as compared to and in the years ended december  and  respectively 
if our international operations grow  we must recruit and hire a number of new consulting  sales and marketing and support personnel in the countries in which we have or will establish offices 
our entry into new international markets typically requires the establishment of new marketing and distribution channels as well as the development and subsequent support of localized versions of our software 
international introductions of our products often require a significant investment in advance of anticipated future revenues 
the opening of our new offices typically results in initial recruiting and training expenses and reduced labor efficiencies associated with the introduction of products to a new market 
if we are less successful in a new market than we expect  we may not be able to realize an adequate return on our initial investment and our operating results could suffer 
if we have to downsize certain international operations  the costs to do so are typically much higher than downsizing costs in the united states  particularly in europe 
we cannot guarantee that the countries in which we operate will have a sufficient pool of qualified personnel from which to hire  that we will be successful at hiring  training or retaining such personnel  or that we can expand or contract our international operations in a timely  cost effective manner 
our international business operations are subject to risks associated with international activities  including currency fluctuations  higher operating costs due to local laws or regulations  unexpected changes in employment and other regulatory requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers  costs and risks of localizing products for foreign countries  longer accounts receivable payment cycles in certain countries  potentially negative tax consequences  difficulties in staffing and managing geographically disparate operations  greater difficulty in safeguarding intellectual property  licensing and other trade restrictions  ability to negotiate and have enforced favorable contract provisions  repatriation of earnings  the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws  anti american sentiment due to the war with iraq  and other american policies that may be unpopular in certain regions  the effects of regional and global infectious diseases such as sars  and general economic conditions in international markets 
consulting services in support of certain international software licenses typically have lower gross margins than those achieved domestically due to generally lower billing rates and or higher costs in certain of our international markets 
accordingly  any significant growth in our international operations may result in declines in gross margins on consulting services 
we expect that an increasing portion of our international software license  consulting services and maintenance services revenues will be denominated in foreign currencies  subjecting us to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
as we continue to expand our international operations  exposures to gains and losses on foreign currency transactions may increase 
we may choose to limit such exposure from time to time by entering into forward foreign currency exchange contracts or engaging in similar hedging strategies 
we cannot guarantee that any currency exchange strategy would be successful in avoiding exchange related losses 
in addition  revenues earned in various countries where we do business may be subject to taxation by more than one jurisdiction  which would reduce our earnings 
we may face difficulties in our highly competitive markets  particularly if the current weak economic conditions persist 
we encounter competitive products from a different set of vendors in each of our primary product categories 
we believe that while our markets are still subject to intense competition  the number of significant competitors in many of our application markets has diminished over the past five years 
we believe the principal competitive factors in our markets are feature and functionality  product reputation and reference accounts  vendor viability  retail and supply chain industry expertise  total solution cost and quality of customer support 
our retail enterprise systems compete primarily with internally developed systems and other third party developers such as ac nielsen corporation  aldata solutions  alphameric plc formerly compass software group plc  connect systems  inc  island pacific  inc 
formerly svi holdings  inc  marketmax  inc recently acquired by sas  micro strategies incorporated  evant  inc 
formerly nonstop solutions  lawson software  nsb retail systems plc  retek  inc  and sap ag 
in addition  new competitors may enter our markets and offer merchandise management systems that target the retail industry 
the competition for our in store systems is more fragmented than the competition for our retail enterprise systems 
we compete primarily with small point of sale focused companies such as crs business computers  kronos incorporated  micro systems  inc formerly datavantage  inc  radiant systems  inc  commerce  tomax technologies and triversity  inc 
we also compete with other broad solution set providers such as nsb retail systems plc  retek  inc  and sap ag campbell software division 
our current collaborative solutions compete primarily with products from marketmax  inc recently acquired by sas  evant inc 
formerly nonstop solutions  ac nielsen corporation  i technologies  manugistics group  inc  information resources  inc  and synchra systems 
in the market for consulting services  we have pursued a strategy of forming informal working relationships with leading retail systems integrators such as ibm global services  cap gemini ernst young  kurt salmon associates and lakewest consulting 
these integrators  as well as independent consulting firms such as accenture  aig netplex  cft consulting  spl and id applications  also represent competition to our consulting services group 
moreover  because many of these consulting firms are involved in advising our prospective customers in the software selection process  they may successfully encourage a prospective customer to select software from a software company with whom they have a relationship 
examples of such relationships between consulting firms and software companies include the relationships between retek  inc and accenture 
as we continue to develop or acquire e commerce products and expand our business in the collaborative solutions area  we expect to face potential competition from business to business e commerce application providers  including ariba  commerce one  commercialware  i technologies  manugistics group  inc  microsoft  inc  retek  inc  sap ag  synchra systems  ecometry corporation  and others 
a few of our existing competitors  as well as a number of potential new competitors  have significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than we do  which could provide them with a significant competitive advantage over us 
in addition  we could face competition from large  multi industry technology companies that have historically not offered an enterprise solution set to the retail supply chain market 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to compete successfully against our current or future competitors  or that competition will not have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
it may be difficult to identify  adopt and develop product architecture that is compatible with emerging industry standards 
the markets for our software products are characterized by rapid technological change  evolving industry standards  changes in customer requirements and frequent new product introductions and enhancements 
we continuously evaluate new technologies and implement into our products advanced technology such as our current 
net effort 
however  if we fail in our product development efforts to accurately address in a timely manner  evolving industry standards  new technology advancements or important third party interfaces or product architectures  sales of our products and services will suffer 
our software products can be licensed with a variety of popular industry standard platforms  and are authored in various development environments using different programming languages and underlying databases and architectures 
there may be future or existing platforms that achieve popularity in the marketplace that may not be compatible with our software product design 
developing and maintaining consistent software product performance across various technology platforms could place a significant strain on our resources and software product release schedules  which could adversely affect our results of operations 
we may have difficulty implementing our products 
our software products are complex and perform or directly affect mission critical functions across many different functional and geographic areas of the enterprise 
consequently  implementation of our software products can be a lengthy process  and commitment of resources by our clients is subject to a number of significant risks over which we have little or no control 
although average implementation times have recently declined  we believe the implementation of the unix oracle versions of our products can be longer and more complicated than our other applications as they typically i appeal to larger retailers who have multiple divisions requiring multiple implementation projects  ii require the execution of implementation procedures in multiple layers of software  iii offer a retailer more deployment options and other configuration choices  and iv may involve third party integrators to change business processes concurrent with the implementation of the software 
delays in the implementations of any of our software products  whether by our business partners or us  may result in client dissatisfaction  disputes with our customers  or damage to our reputation 
significant problems implementing our software therefore  can cause delays or prevent us from collecting license fees for our software and can damage our ability to get new business 
our fixed price service contracts may result in losses 
we offer a combination of software products  consulting and maintenance services to our customers 
typically  we enter into service agreements with our customers that provide for consulting services on a time and expenses basis 
certain clients have asked for  and we have from time to time entered into  fixed price service contracts  which link services payments  and occasionally software payments  to implementation milestones 
we believe fixed price service contracts may increasingly be offered by our competitors to differentiate their product and service offerings 
as a result  we may need to enter into more fixed price contracts in the future 
if we are unable to meet our contractual obligations under fixed price contracts within our estimated cost structure  our operating results could suffer 
our success depends upon our proprietary technology 
our success and competitive position is dependent in part upon our ability to develop and maintain the proprietary aspect of our technology 
the reverse engineering  unauthorized copying  or other misappropriation of our technology could enable third parties to benefit from our technology without paying for it 
we rely on a combination of trademark  trade secret  copyright law and contractual restrictions to protect the proprietary aspects of our technology 
we seek to protect the source code to our software  documentation and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws 
to date  we have not protected our technology with issued patents 
effective copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries 
we license our software products under signed license agreements that impose restrictions on the licensee s ability to utilize the software and do not permit the re sale  sublicense or other transfer of the source code 
finally  we seek to avoid disclosure of our intellectual property by requiring employees and independent consultants to execute confidentiality agreements with us and by restricting access to our source code 
there has been a substantial amount of litigation in the software and internet industries regarding intellectual property rights 
it is possible that in the future third parties may claim that our current or potential future software solutions or we infringe on their intellectual property 
we expect that software product developers and providers of e commerce products will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlap 
moreover  as software patents become more common  the likelihood increases that a patent holder will bring an infringement action against us  or against our customers  to whom we have indemnification obligations 
in addition  we may find it necessary to initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to protect our trade secrets 
since we now resell hardware we may also become subject to claims from third parties that the hardware  or the combination of hardware and software  infringe their intellectual property 
although we may disclaim certain intellectual property representations to our customers  these disclaimers may not be sufficient to fully protect us against such claims 
we may be more vulnerable to patent claims since we do not have any patents that we can assert defensively against a patent infringement claim 
any claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or license agreements 
royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
if we lose access to critical third party software or technology  our costs could increase and the introduction of new products and product enhancements could be delayed  potentially hurting our competitive position 
we license and integrate technology from third parties in certain of our software products 
for example  we license the uniface client server application development technology from compuware  inc for use in pmm  certain applications from silvon software  inc for use in ideas  ibm s net 
commerce merchant server software for use in customer ordering  and the syncsort application for use in portfolio planning by arthur 
these third party licenses generally require us to pay royalties and fulfill confidentiality obligations 
if we are unable to continue to license any of this third party software  or if the third party licensors do not adequately maintain or update their products  we would face delays in the releases of our software until equivalent technology can be identified  licensed or developed  and integrated into our software products 
these delays  if they occur  could harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
it is also possible that intellectual property acquired from third parties through acquisitions  mergers  licenses or otherwise may not have been adequately protected 
we may face liability if our products are defective or if we make errors implementing our products 
our software products are highly complex and sophisticated 
as a result  they may occasionally contain design defects or software errors that could be difficult to detect and correct 
in addition  implementation of our products may involve customer specific configuration by third parties or us  and may involve integration with systems developed by third parties 
in particular  it is common for complex software programs  such as our unix oracle and e commerce software products  to contain undetected errors when first released 
they are discovered only after the product has been implemented and used over time with different computer systems and in a variety of applications and environments 
despite extensive testing  we have in the past discovered certain defects or errors in our products or custom configurations only after our software products have been used by many clients 
for example  we will likely experience undetected errors in our 
net applications as we begin to implement them for the first time at customer sites 
in addition  our clients may occasionally experience difficulties integrating our products with other hardware or software in their environment that are unrelated to defects in our products 
such defects  errors or difficulties may cause future delays in product introductions and shipments  result in increased costs and diversion of development resources  require design modifications or impair customer satisfaction with our products 
we believe that significant investments in research and development are required to remain competitive  and that speed to market is critical to our success 
our future performance will depend in large part on our ability to enhance our existing products through internal development and strategic partnering  internally develop new products which leverage both our existing customers and sales force  and strategically acquire complementary retail point and collaborative solutions that add functionality for specific business processes to an enterprise wide system 
if clients experience significant problems with implementation of our products or are otherwise dissatisfied with their functionality or performance or if they fail to achieve market acceptance for any reason  our market reputation could suffer  and we could be subject to claims for significant damages 
although our customer agreements contain limitation of liability clauses and exclude consequential damages  there can be no assurances that such contract provisions will be enforced 
any such damages claim could impair our market reputation and could have a material adverse affect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we are dependent on key personnel 
our performance depends in large part on the continued performance of our executive officers and other key employees  particularly the performance and services of james d 
armstrong our chairman and hamish n 
j 
brewer our chief executive officer 
mr 
brewer was promoted to chief executive officer on august  having served as our president since april and as a senior officer of the company since he succeeds mr 
armstrong who continues as chairman of the board 
as chairman  mr 
armstrong retains his active leadership role  focusing on strategic planning  merger and acquisition opportunities  major product decisions and key customer relationships 
we do not have in place key person life insurance policies on any of our employees 
the loss of the services of mr 
armstrong  mr 
brewer  or other key executive officers or employees without a successor in place  or any difficulties associated with our succession  could negatively affect our financial performance 
we may have difficulty integrating acquisitions 
we continually evaluate potential acquisitions of complementary businesses  products and technologies  including those that are significant in size and scope 
in pursuit of our strategy to acquire complementary products  we completed the acquisition of the assets of zapotec software  inc in february  the neovista decision series from accrue software  inc in june  the acquisition of all the common stock of e in september  the acquisition of certain intellectual property from j commerce in april  and the acquisition of certain intellectual property from vista software solutions  inc in april  the acquisition of substantially all remaining intellectual property and certain other assets of engage  inc in august  and the acquisition of substantially all the assets of timera retail solutions on january  the e acquisition was our largest to date  and involved the integration of e s products and operations in countries 
the risks we commonly encounter in acquisitions include we may have difficulty assimilating the operations and personnel of the acquired company  we may have difficulty effectively integrating the acquired technologies or products with our current products and technologies  our ongoing business may be disrupted by transition and integration issues  we may not be able to retain key technical and managerial personnel from the acquired business  we may be unable to achieve the financial and strategic goals for the acquired and combined businesses  we may have difficulty in maintaining controls  procedures and policies during the transition and integration  our relationships with partner companies or third party providers of technology or products could be adversely affected  our relationships with employees and customers could be impaired  our due diligence process may fail to identify significant issues with product quality  product architecture  legal contingencies  and product development  among other things  we may be subject to as a successor  certain liabilities of our acquisition targets  and we may be required to sustain significant exit charges if products acquired in business combinations are unsuccessful 
it may become increasingly expensive to obtain and maintain liability insurance at current levels 
we contract for insurance to cover a variety of potential risks and liabilities 
in the current market  insurance coverage is becoming more restrictive and expensive  and when certain insurance coverage is offered  the deductible for which we are responsible is larger 
in light of these circumstances  it may become more difficult to maintain insurance coverage at historical levels  or if such coverage is available  the cost to obtain or maintain it may increase substantially 
this may result in our being forced to bear the burden of an increased portion of risks for which we have traditionally been covered by insurance  which could negatively impact the company s results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s we are exposed to certain market risks in the ordinary course of our business 
these risks result primarily from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
in addition  our international operations are subject to risks related to differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  and other regulations and restrictions 
foreign currency exchange rates 
our international operations expose us to foreign currency exchange rate changes that could impact translations of foreign denominated assets and liabilities into us dollars and future earnings and cash flows from transactions denominated in different currencies 
international revenues represented of total revenues in the year ended december  as compared to and in the years ended december  and  respectively 
in addition  the identifiable net assets of our foreign operations totaled of consolidated net assets at december  and our exposure to currency exchange rate changes is diversified due to the number of different countries in which we conduct business 
we operate outside the united states primarily through wholly owned subsidiaries in europe  asia pacific  canada and latin america 
we have determined that the functional currency of each of our foreign subsidiaries is the local currency and as such  foreign currency translation adjustments are recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity 
changes in the currency exchange rates of our foreign subsidiaries resulted in our reporting unrealized foreign currency exchange gains of million and million in and  respectively 
we did not engage in any material foreign currency hedging transactions during  however  during fourth quarter we began using derivative financial instruments  primarily forward exchange contracts  to manage a majority of the foreign currency exchange exposure associated with net short term foreign denominated assets and liabilities which exist as part of our ongoing business operations 
the exposures relate primarily to the gain or loss recognized in earnings from the revaluation or settlement of current foreign denominated assets and liabilities 
we no not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the forward exchange contracts generally have maturities of less than days  and are not designated as hedging instruments under sfas no 
forward exchange contracts are marked to market at the end of each reporting period  with gains and losses recognized in other income  net  offset by the gains or losses resulting from the settlement of the underlying foreign denominated assets and liabilities 
at december   we had forward exchange contracts with a notional value of million and an associated net forward contract liability of  which is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities 
at december   we had forward exchange contracts with a notional value of million and an insignificant forward contract liability 
the notional value represents the amount of foreign currencies to be purchased or sold at maturity and does not represent our exposure on these contracts 
we do not anticipate any material adverse impact to our financial statements as a result of these forward exchange contracts 
foreign currency gains and losses will continue to result from fluctuations in the value of the currencies in which we conduct operations as compared to the us dollar  and future operating results will be affected to some extent by gains and losses from foreign currency exposure 
we prepared sensitivity analyses of our exposures from foreign net working capital as of december  to assess the impact of hypothetical changes in foreign currency rates 
based upon the results of these analyses  a adverse change in all foreign currency rates from the december  rates would result in a currency translation loss of million before tax 
interest rates 
we invest our cash in a variety of financial instruments  including bank time deposits  and variable and fixed rate obligations of the us government and its agencies  states  municipalities  commercial paper and corporate bonds 
these investments are denominated in us dollars 
we classify all of our investments as available for sale in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
cash balances in foreign currencies overseas are operating balances and are invested in short term deposits of the local operating bank 
interest income earned on our investments is reflected in our financial statements under the caption other income  net 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates  or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have suffered a decline in market value due to a change in interest rates 
we hold our investment securities for purposes other than trading 
the fair value of securities held at december  was million  which is approximately the same as amortized cost  with interest rates generally ranging between and
