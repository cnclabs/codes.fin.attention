overview we are a leading supplier of automation products and solutions primarily serving the worldwide semiconductor market 
we supply hardware  software and services to both chip manufacturers and original equipment manufacturers  or oems  who make process equipment for semiconductor manufacturing 
our offerings range from hardware and software modules to fully integrated systems and services 
although our core business addresses the increasingly complex automation requirements of the global semiconductor industry  we are also focused on providing automation solutions for a number of related industries  including flat panel display manufacturing  data storage and other complex manufacturing 

table of contents we operate in three major segments equipment automation  factory automation hardware and factory automation software 
equipment or tool automation consists of hardware and software used on or within process tools to move individual wafers in and out of a tool 
factory automation hardware consists of equipment used inside the fab  but external to a process tool  to automate the handling of batches of wafers or other material throughout the production floor  as well as specialized tools for automatically sorting  storing and inspecting material 
factory automation software is used within a factory in computer integrated manufacturing for controlling and managing production and resources in a fab 
we sell our products and services to nearly every major semiconductor chip manufacturer and oem in the world  including all of the top ten chip companies and nine of the top ten semiconductor equipment companies 
we are currently reviewing the capabilities within our jena  germany manufacturing facility 
certain products and functions may be able to be produced and provided at lower costs through third party suppliers 
we are currently evaluating a variety of different alternatives in order to continue to increase efficiency and reduce costs 
the semiconductor industry is cyclical in nature  and the market conditions indicate relatively flat to declining demand 
we are focusing our major efforts in the following areas sustaining our ability to meet our customers requirements on a timely basis through the implementation of flexible manufacturing processes while at the same time improving product quality  controlling costs  and maintaining supply relationships that provide continuing  flexible access to essential components and materials even as demand for our product fluctuates  aligning costs and revenues to sustain profitable levels of operation  including positive operating cash flow  developing the products and services required for future success in the market and assuring that they will be competitively priced  greater expansion into other industries such as flat panel display manufacturing for our hardware products as well as aerospace and defense  automotive  and medical devices for our software products  expanding our sales of equipment automation products to process tool manufacturers that currently produce automation equipment internally  continuing to develop our contract automation systems business with process tool manufacturers  greater expansion of software development capabilities in countries outside of the united states  specifically india  determining how best to improve our customer sales and support structure  evaluating the location of our manufacturing operations  evaluating our strategic direction and value of non core products  and improving the efficiency of our internal information and business systems  which could result in the upgrade or replacement of certain applications 

table of contents in fiscal  our total revenues grew to million compared to growth in fiscal this increase is consistent with and reflective of increased industry demand for semiconductor capital equipment in fiscal our revenue by segment for fiscal and is as follows for the year ended september  equipment automation factory automation hardware factory automation software other our equipment automation revenues increased from the prior year to million 
this increase is primarily attributable to increased shipments to our oem customer base as demand for these products from these customers has increased due to a higher demand for semiconductor capital equipment 
our factory automation hardware revenues increased from the prior year to million 
this increase is also reflective of industry trends of higher demand for semiconductor capital equipment during fiscal we expect fiscal revenues for both our equipment automation and factory automation hardware segments to decrease slightly from current levels as forecasted industry demand has softened 
our factory automation software revenues increased from the prior year to million 
the increase is primarily attributable to increased market demand for our software products along with the completion and acceptance by the customer of a major european software project in fiscal we expect fiscal revenues for our factory automation software segment to slightly decline as compared to present levels due to forecasted increases in base revenues being offset by the absence of the significant european software project recognized in fiscal gross margins increased percentage points to for fiscal in comparison to a percentage point increase in fiscal the increase is primarily attributable to our plant consolidation and other cost reduction measures along with increased sales volumes resulting in more favorable absorption of fixed costs 
we expect our gross margins to remain relatively flat in the near term due to softening market demand not enabling further efficiency gains 
our revenue growth  improving gross margin and reduced operating costs resulted in net income of million or per diluted share in fiscal compared to a net loss of million or per diluted share in fiscal this improvement in operating results  combined with successful working capital management  enabled us to generate million of cash from operations in fiscal compared to cash usage from operations of million in fiscal related parties on june   we appointed joseph r 
martin to our board of directors 
mr 
martin is also vice chairman and a director of fairchild semiconductor international  inc fairchild  one of our customers 
accordingly  fairchild is considered a related party for the period subsequent to june  revenues from fairchild for the years ended september   and were approximately   and  respectively 
the amounts due from fairchild included in accounts receivable at september  and were  and  respectively 
related party transactions and amounts included in accounts receivable and revenue are on standard pricing and contractual terms and manner of settlement for products and services of similar types and at comparable volumes 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of 
table of contents contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  goodwill  income taxes  warranty obligations  the adequacy of restructuring reserves and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  including current and anticipated worldwide economic conditions both in general and specifically in relation to the semiconductor industry  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
as discussed under asset impairments and the year over year comparisons below  actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenues product revenues are associated with the sale of equipment automation systems and components  the sale of factory automation hardware products  and the sale of factory automation software licenses 
service revenues are associated with hardware related field service  training  software maintenance and software related consulting and integration services 
revenue from product sales that do not include significant customization is recorded upon delivery and transfer of risk of loss to the customer provided there is evidence of an arrangement  fees are fixed or determinable  collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured and  if applicable  customer acceptance criteria have been successfully demonstrated 
customer acceptance provisions include final testing and acceptance carried out prior to shipment 
these pre shipment testing and acceptance procedures ensure that the product meets the published specification requirements before the product is shipped 
if the arrangement contains extended payment terms  revenue is recognized as the payments become due 
shipping terms are customarily fob shipping point 
costs incurred for shipping and handling and reimbursable expenses are included in revenues and cost of sales 
a provision for product warranty costs is recorded to estimate costs associated with warranty liabilities 
when significant on site customer acceptance provisions are present in the arrangement  revenue is recognized upon completion of customer acceptance testing 
revenue from the sale of off the shelf software licenses is recognized upon delivery to the customer provided there is evidence of an arrangement  fees are fixed or determinable  collection of the related receivable is probable  and there are no unusual acceptance criteria or extended payment terms 
if the arrangement contains acceptance criteria or testing  then revenue is recognized upon acceptance or the successful completion of the testing 
if the arrangement contains extended payment terms  revenue is recognized as the payments become due 
revenue related to post contract support is deferred and recognized ratably over the contract period 
for tailored software contracts  we provide significant consulting services to tailor the software to the customer s environment 
if we are able to reasonably estimate the level of effort and related costs to complete the contract  we utilize the percentage of completion method 
revisions in revenue and cost estimates are recorded in the periods in which the facts that require such revisions become known 
if our ability to complete the tailored software is uncertain or if we cannot reasonably estimate the level of effort and related costs  completed contract accounting is applied 
losses  if any  are provided for in the period in which such losses are first identified by management 
generally  the terms of long term contracts provide for progress billing based on completion of certain phases of work 
for maintenance contracts  service revenue is deferred based on vendor specific objective evidence of its fair value and is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance contract 
deferred revenue primarily relates to services and maintenance agreements and billings on long term contracts accounted for using the completed contract method and contracts awaiting final customer acceptance 
in transactions that include multiple products and or services  we allocate the sales value among each of the deliverables based on their relative fair values and recognize such revenue when they are delivered 
we enter into two types of significant multi element arrangements tailored software arrangements  described above  and software sales with post contract support 
revenue for undelivered support on software sales with 
table of contents post contract support is deferred based on vendor specific objective evidence of the value of the support and recognized ratably over the support term 
intangible assets and goodwill we have made a number of acquisitions in previous years  and as a result  identified significant intangible assets and generated significant goodwill 
intangible assets are valued based on estimates of future cash flows and amortized over their estimated useful life 
goodwill is subject to annual impairment testing as well as testing upon the occurrence of any event that indicates a potential impairment 
intangible assets and other long lived assets are subject to an impairment test if there is an indicator of impairment 
the carrying value and ultimate realization of these assets is dependent upon estimates of future earnings and benefits that we expect to generate from their use 
if our expectations of future results and cash flows change and are significantly diminished  intangible assets and goodwill may be impaired and the resulting charge to operations may be material 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles or other long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more indicators of impairment  we measure impairment  if any  based on the projected undiscounted cash flow method to determine whether an impairment exists  and then measure the impairment using discounted cash flows 
for goodwill  we assess fair value by measuring discounted cash flows of our reporting units and measure impairment  if any  as the difference between the resulting implied fair value of goodwill and the recorded book value of the reporting unit 
the estimation of useful lives and expected cash flows require us to make significant judgments regarding future periods that are subject to some factors outside of our control 
changes in these estimates can result in significant revisions to the carrying value of these assets and may result in material charges to the results of operations 
accounts receivable we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers or economic conditions were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of our customers ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required  with a resulting charge to results of operations 
restructuring we provide reserves for severance benefits and estimated lease obligations net of estimated sublease income for abandoned and vacated facilities 
should actual severance benefits and lease obligations differ from our original estimates  excess reserves may be identified or additional reserves may be required  with a resulting benefit or charge to the results of operations 
warranty we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates and material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required and may result in additional benefits or charges to results of operations 
inventory we provide reserves for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
we fully reserve for inventories deemed obsolete 
we perform periodic reviews of all inventory items to identify excess inventories on hand by comparing on hand balances to anticipated usage using recent historical activity as well as anticipated or forecasted demand  based upon sales and marketing 
table of contents inputs through our planning systems 
if estimates of demand diminish further or actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
deferred taxes we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
in the event we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in excess of their net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
asset impairments goodwill we elected to early adopt the provisions of fas effective october  accordingly  we ceased the ratable amortization of goodwill on that date 
we have elected to perform our annual impairment testing as required under fas on september of each fiscal year 
the economic downturn beginning in which impacted the semiconductor industry continued throughout fiscal throughout fiscal  we continued to monitor industry forecasts which suggested a recovery would occur in the near term 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  updated industry forecasts indicated that the timing and speed of recovery for the sector would be much slower and later than had previously been anticipated 
we performed our annual assessment of the carrying value of our goodwill under the provisions of fas based on the updated projected industry growth rates and resulting discounted cash flow analyses of expectations of future earnings for each of the four reporting units over the remaining lives of the primary assets of each reporting unit  we concluded that the goodwill related to the equipment automation  factory automation hardware and factory automation software segments was impaired 
this impairment in three segments resulted from reduced future earnings expectations due to the prolonged downturn in the semiconductor industry as well as uncertainty as to the timing and speed of recovery for the sector across all three of our semiconductor related reporting units 
accordingly  we recorded a charge to operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal of million for the write down of goodwill million associated with the equipment automation segment  million associated with the factory automation hardware segment and million associated with the factory automation software segment 
in fiscal  the semiconductor industry downturn continued 
prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal  there were no interim indicators of impairment as the market indicated the recovery of the semiconductor industry 
we performed our annual impairment test under fas in the fourth quarter of fiscal using the present value of expected future cash flows 
during this process estimates of revenue and expense were developed for each of our segments and as a whole based on internal as well as external market forecasts 
based on this analysis  we determined that the implied fair value of the factory automation hardware reporting unit s goodwill was less than its book value and therefore recorded a charge of million to write down the value of this goodwill 
in connection with a recent third party letter of intent to purchase the assets of our specialty equipment and life sciences group  which makes up our other segment  we assessed the potential impairment of goodwill in the segment 
we considered the offer in the letter of intent as an indication of the fair value of the segment 
based on our analysis  we determined that the implied fair value of the other reporting unit s goodwill was million less than its book value and recorded a charge to write down the value of this goodwill in the fourth quarter 
as there were no interim indicators of potential impairment of goodwill in our other segments  we performed our annual impairment test under fas in the fourth quarter of fiscal using the present value of expected cash flows 
during this process detailed estimates of revenue and expense were developed for the segments based on internal as well as external market forecasts 
our analyses indicated no impairment of the goodwill in fiscal in these segments 

table of contents other long lived assets in the fourth fiscal quarter of  we performed an assessment of the carrying values of our intangible assets under the provisions of financial accounting standards board statement no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of fas due to the potential impairment indicated by the write down of our goodwill 
we determined that the lowest level of cash flows for the fas impairment test is each reporting unit 
we performed an impairment analysis based on the undiscounted cash flows of expectations of future earnings for each of the reporting units over the remaining lives of the primary assets of each reporting unit  and determined that the various intangibles were impaired 
accordingly  we recorded a charge to operations of million for the write down of the following intangibles assets million for patents  million for completed technology  million for trademarks and trade names  million for customer relationships and million for license agreements and non competition agreements 
of the total amount written down  million was associated with the equipment automation segment  million was associated with the factory automation hardware segment  million was associated with the factory automation software segment and million was associated with our other segment 
this write down resulted from reduced future earnings expectations due to the prolonged downturn in the semiconductor industry and uncertainty as to the timing and speed of recovery for the sector across all of our reporting units 
the write down of intangible assets of million is included within asset impairment charges in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended september  year ended september   compared to year ended september  revenues we reported revenues of million for the year ended september   compared to million in the previous year  a increase 
the increase is consistent with and reflective of a large increase in demand for semiconductor capital equipment experienced in fiscal the increase in customer demand for our hardware and software products experienced during fiscal may not be indicative of future results as current industry forecasts indicate softening market demand 
our equipment automation segment reported revenues of million in the year ended september   an increase of from the prior year 
this increase is attributable to increased shipments to our oem customer base as demand for products from these customers has increased due to a higher demand for semiconductor capital equipment reflective of current industry trends 
we expect near term revenues for our equipment automation segment to decrease slightly as compared to present levels as forecasted demand decreases 
our factory automation hardware segment reported a increase  to million  in the year ended september   compared to the previous year 
the increase is primarily attributable to an increase in order volume and market demand  reflective of current industry trends of increased demand for semiconductor capital equipment 
we expect near term revenues for our factory automation hardware segment to decrease slightly as compared to present levels as forecasted demand decreases 
our factory automation software segment reported revenues of million  a increase from million in the prior year 
the increase is primarily attributable to strong software license sales driven by increased market demand coupled with the completion and acceptance by the customer of a major european software project for approximately million in the second quarter of fiscal we expect revenues for the next fiscal year for our factory automation software segment to slightly decline as compared to fiscal due to forecasted increases in base revenues offset by the absence of the significant european software project mentioned above that will not repeat in fiscal a significant portion of revenue for the factory automation software segment relates to maintenance contracts 
maintenance revenues are only slightly affected by an 
table of contents economic downturn  as customers typically continue to use previously purchased software products and renew related maintenance arrangements 
product revenues increased million  or  to million  in the year ended september   from million in the previous fiscal year 
this increase is attributable to strong demand for our equipment automation and factory automation hardware products and our factory automation software license revenues reflective of industry trends of increased demand for semiconductor capital equipment in fiscal product revenues for our equipment automation  factory automation hardware and factory automation software segments grew by  and  respectively  from fiscal levels 
service revenues increased million  or  to million 
this increase is primarily attributable to the completion and acceptance by the customer of a major european software project for approximately million in the second quarter of fiscal we were unable to make a reasonable and dependable estimate of the costs to fulfill this contract due to the complexity of the arrangement 
as a result  we concluded that the completed contract method of accounting was required for this contract 
revenues outside the united states were million  or of revenues  and million  or of revenues  in the years ended september  and  respectively 
we expect that foreign revenues will continue to account for a significant portion of total revenues 
the current international component of revenues is not indicative of the future international component of revenues 
deferred revenues of million at september  consisted of million related to deferred maintenance contracts and million related to revenues deferred for completed contract method arrangements and contracts awaiting final customer acceptance 
gross margin gross margin increased to million or for the year ended september   compared to or for the previous year 
our equipment automation segment gross margin increased to million or in the year ended september   from million or in the prior year 
the increase is primarily attributable to our plant consolidation and other cost reduction measures along with increased volumes resulting in more favorable absorption of fixed costs related to this segment 
these improvements were offset by million of contract automation systems revenues which have lower gross margins of 
gross margin for our factory automation hardware segment increased to million or in the year ended september   from million or in the prior year 
the increase is primarily the result of our plant consolidation and other cost reduction measures along with increased volumes resulting in more favorable absorption of fixed costs related to this segment 
in addition  in the prior year  we completed several low margin projects which contributed to lower margins in fiscal our factory automation software segment s gross margin for the year ended september   increased to million or  compared to million or in the prior year 
the increase is primarily the result of additional product mix of license revenue  which yield higher gross margins in the current year period and the favorable impact of our cost reduction measures  offset by the impact of lower gross margins realized on the million of software project revenue recognized upon completion and acceptance by the customer in the second quarter of fiscal there was no area of our business in which pricing pressure exerted an impact which was disproportionate with other competitive factors 
gross margin on product revenues was million or for the year ended september   compared to million or for the prior year 
the increase in product margins is primarily attributable to the impact of our cost reduction measures along with a more favorable mix of oem products and software license revenues which have higher gross margins 
gross margin on service revenues was million or for the year ended september   compared to million or in the previous year 
the decrease is primarily the result of the services revenue mix partially offset by the positive impact of our cost reduction initiatives 
service revenues margins were impacted by lower gross margins realized on the million of software project revenue recognized upon completion and acceptance by the customer in the second quarter of fiscal 
table of contents research and development research and development expenses for the year ended september   were million  a decrease of million  compared to million in the previous year 
research and development expenses also decreased as a percentage of revenues  to  from in the prior year 
the decrease in absolute spending and as a percentage of revenues is primarily the result of our cost reduction actions coupled with higher revenue levels against which these costs were measured 
our plan in hardware is to continue to invest in research and development to enhance existing products and develop new tool and factory hardware for the semiconductor industry 
our plan in software is to continue to invest in research and development to enhance existing factory automation products and develop new products for the semiconductor market  as well as invest in the development of manufacturing software for the flat panel display  high tech electronics  medical instrumentation  aerospace and defense  and automotive manufacturing industries 
these investments will be focused on those research and development projects that are most consistent with our business realignment 
we expect our future research and development expenses will continue at the present levels for fiscal selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended september   a decrease of million  compared to million in the prior year 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of revenues  to in the year ended september   from in the previous year 
apart from the higher revenue levels against which these costs were measured  the decrease in absolute spending and as a percentage of revenues is primarily the result of our cost containment and reduction initiatives as well as the reversal of excess bad debt reserves of million in fiscal as collections of overdue receivables have improved 
this decrease is offset by higher expenses for incentive compensation plans that we have established  coupled with higher revenue levels against which these costs were measured 
we expect that selling  general and administrative expense in fiscal will be relatively flat compared to fiscal amortization of acquired intangible assets amortization expense for acquired intangible assets totaled million for the year ended september   compared to million for the same prior year period 
the reduction in amortization of acquired intangible assets is primarily attributable to certain assets reaching the end of their useful lives 
goodwill impairment charges goodwill impairment charges totaled million for the year ended september  and consisted of the impairment of our goodwill related to our other segment that is pertaining to specialty equipment and life sciences products and services  as described previously in asset impairments 
goodwill impairment charges totaled million for the year ended september  and consisted of the impairment of our goodwill related to our factory automation hardware segment  as described previously in asset impairments 
restructuring and acquisition related charges we recorded a charge to operations of million in the year ended september   of which million related to acquisitions and million to restructuring costs 
the million related to acquisitions is comprised of million of legal and consulting costs to integrate and consolidate acquired entities into our existing entities 
the million of restructuring costs consisted of million related to workforce reductions of approximately employees world wide  across all functions of the business and million related to excess facilities 
excess facilities charges of million consisted of million for excess facilities identified in fiscal that were recorded to recognize the expected amount of the remaining lease obligations 
these costs have been estimated from the time when the space is vacant  and there are no plans to utilize the facility 
costs incurred prior to vacating the facilities were charged to operations 
final exit costs for facilities abandoned in previous restructurings amounted to million 
the remaining million 
table of contents represents a reevaluation of the assumptions used in determining the fair value of certain lease obligations related to facilities abandoned in a previous restructuring 
the revised assumptions  including lower estimates of expected sub rental income over the remainder of the lease terms  are based on management s evaluation of the rental space available 
we believe that the cost reduction programs implemented will align costs with revenues at present levels 
in the event we are unable to achieve this alignment  additional cost cutting programs may be required in the future 
the accruals for workforce reductions are expected to be paid over the first six months of fiscal the facilities charges are expected to be paid over the remaining lease periods  expiring in fiscal these charges helped better align our cost structure 
we estimate that salary and benefit savings in principally the selling  general and administrative functions as a result of these actions will be approximately million annually 
the impact of these cost reductions on our liquidity is not significant  as these cost savings yield actual cash savings within twelve months 
we recorded a charge to operations of million in the year ended september   of which million related to acquisitions  million related to the write off of capitalized costs associated with cancelled internal systems applications and infrastructure programs  and million to restructuring costs 
of this amount  million related to workforce reductions of approximately  employees and million related to excess facilities 
excess facilities charges of million consisted of million for excess facilities identified in fiscal that were recorded to recognize the remaining lease obligations  net of any sublease rentals 
these costs have been estimated from the time when the space is vacant and there are no plans to utilize the facilities 
costs incurred prior to vacating the facilities were charged to operations 
the remaining million represents a reevaluation of assumptions used in determining the fair value of certain lease obligations related to facilities abandoned in a previous restructuring 
the revised assumptions  including lower estimates of expected sub rental income over the remainder of the lease terms are based on management s evaluation of the rental space available 
periodically  the accruals related to restructuring charges are reviewed and compared to their respective cash requirements 
as a result of those reviews  the accruals are adjusted for changes in cost and timing assumptions of previously accrued and recorded initiatives 
during fiscal  we identified million of excess accruals associated with headcount reduction plans previously announced and implemented and million of excess accruals for other restructuring costs 
the final costs associated with these actions were lower than originally anticipated and accrued 
as a result  the excess accruals for these actions were reversed  with a corresponding reduction to restructuring expense 
the million related to acquisitions is comprised of the million loss on the disposition of our swiss subsidiary  associated legal costs of million and million of legal  relocation and consulting costs to integrate and consolidate acquired entities into our existing entities 
these charges helped better align our cost structure 
we estimate that salary and benefit savings across all expense categories as a result of these actions were approximately million annually 
the impact of these reduction activities on our liquidity is not significant  as these cost savings yield actual cash savings within twelve months 
we estimate annual facilities savings were approximately million principally within our cost of sales as a result of these actions 
interest income and expense interest income increased by million  to million  in the year ended september   from million the previous year 
this increase is due primarily to higher cash balances that were available for investment offset by lower interest rates that were realized on our investment balances 
interest expense of million and million for the years ended september  and  respectively  relates primarily to the convertible subordinated notes 
other income expense other expense decreased by million  to million  in the year ended september   from million the previous year 
other expense for the year ended september  consisted primarily of the settlement of an arbitration proceeding in israel of million and realized losses on foreign currency transactions during the year 
other expense in the year ended september  consisted primarily of losses 
table of contents we incurred as a result of the disposal of the shinsung warrants and shares in the amount of million and million  respectively  and realized losses on foreign currency transactions 
income tax provision we recorded an income tax provision of million in the year ended september  and an income tax provision of million in the year ended september  the tax provision recorded in fiscal and is attributable to foreign income and withholding taxes 
as a result of recognizing an operating loss during the year ended september   and the continuing uncertainty in the semiconductor sector  we determined that it was more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would not be realized and recorded a full valuation allowance at september  we continued to provide a full valuation allowance for our net deferred tax assets at september  and  as we believe it is more likely than not that the future tax benefits from accumulated net operating losses and deferred taxes will not be realized 
if we generate future taxable income against which these tax attributes may be applied  some portion or all of the valuation allowance would be reversed and a corresponding increase in net income would be reported in future periods 
year ended september   compared to year ended september  revenues we reported revenues of million for the year ended september   compared to million in the previous year  a increase 
the increase in revenues was principally attributable to a full year of incremental revenue from the acquisitions consummated during fiscal of million offset by the downturn that affected the semiconductor industry throughout the year

table of contents our equipment automation segment gross margin increased to million or in the year ended september   from million or in the prior year 
gross margin for our factory automation hardware segment increased to million or in the year ended september   from million or in the prior year 
the increases above were primarily the result of our plant consolidation and other cost reduction measures 
our cost reduction programs included a reduction in field service personnel as well as certain fixed costs  such as facility costs which principally improved our services margin 
we also experienced an increased volume of spare parts revenue as a result of our additional product offerings arising from the pri acquisition and the resulting larger installed base of customers 
our factory automation software segment s gross margin for the year ended september   increased to million or  compared to million or in the prior year 
the change was not significant 
gross margin on product revenues was million or for the year ended september   compared to million or for the prior year 
the decrease in gross margin percent was primarily attributable to the lower manufacturing utilization we experienced in connection with the continuing downturn in the semiconductor industry 
we experienced low gross margins on our factory automation hardware products primarily as the result of the completion of several low margin projects acquired as a result of the pri acquisition

restructuring and acquisition related charges we recorded a charge to operations of million in the year ended september   of which million related to acquisitions  million related to the write off of capitalized costs associated with cancelled internal systems applications and infrastructure programs  and million related to restructuring costs 
of this amount  million related to workforce reductions of approximately  employees and million related to excess facilities 
excess facilities charges of million consisted of million for excess facilities identified in fiscal that were recorded to recognize the remaining lease obligations  net of any sublease rentals 
these costs have been estimated from the time when the space is expected to be vacated and there are no plans to utilize the facilities 
costs incurred prior to vacating the facilities were charged to operations 
the remaining million represents a reevaluation of assumptions used in determining the fair value of certain lease obligations related to facilities abandoned in a previous restructuring 
the revised assumptions  including lower estimates of expected sub rental income over the remainder of the lease terms are based on management s evaluation of the rental space available 
periodically  the accruals related to restructuring charges are reviewed and compared to their respective cash requirements 
as a result of those reviews  the accruals are adjusted for changes in cost and timing assumptions of previously accrued and recorded initiatives 
during fiscal  we identified million of excess accruals associated with headcount reduction plans previously announced and implemented and million of excess accruals for other restructuring costs 
the final costs associated with these actions were lower than originally anticipated and accrued 
as a result  the excess accruals for these actions were reversed  with a corresponding reduction to restructuring expense 
the million related to acquisitions is comprised of the million loss on the disposition of our swiss subsidiary  associated legal costs of million and million of legal  relocation and consulting costs to integrate and consolidate acquired entities into our existing entities 
these charges helped better align our cost structure 
we estimate that salary and benefit savings across all expense categories as a result of these actions were approximately million annually 
the impact of these cost reduction activities on our liquidity is not significant  as these cost savings yield actual cash savings within twelve months 
we estimate annual facilities savings were approximately million principally within our cost of sales as a result of these actions 
in september  we approved a formal plan of restructure in response to the ongoing downturn in the semiconductor industry  which continued to exert downward pressure on our revenues and cost structure 
to that effect  we recorded restructuring charges of million in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 
of this amount  million was related to workforce reductions of approximately employees  which was paid in fiscal  million was for the consolidation of several of our facilities  and million was for other restructuring costs 
these measures were largely intended to further align our capacity and infrastructure to anticipated customer demand  which was adversely affected by the continuing downturn in the semiconductor industry 
workforce related charges  consisting principally of severance costs  were recorded based on specific identification of employees to be terminated  along with their job classifications or functions and their locations 
the charges for our excess facilities were recorded to recognize the remaining lease obligations  net of any sublease rentals 
these costs have been estimated from the time when the space was expected to be vacated and there are no plans to utilize the facility in the future 
costs incurred prior to vacating the facilities were charged to operations 
as part of the plan to integrate the pri acquisition  certain sales  technical support and administrative functions were combined and headcount and related costs reduced 
accordingly  during the third quarter of fiscal  we recorded million of restructuring charges comprised of million for workforce reduction related costs for our existing employees  million related to our excess existing facilities and million of other restructuring costs 
the million for our excess facilities was recorded to recognize the remaining lease obligations  net of any sublease rentals 

table of contents restructuring costs of million for former pri employees  million for pri facilities and million for other costs were accrued as part of the purchase accounting for the pri acquisition  relating to the consolidation and elimination of certain pri duplicate facilities and redundant pri personnel 
we anticipated headcount reductions of approximately people across all functional areas of the combined company and  as such  included an estimated accrual for workforce reductions of million comprised of severance  employee benefits and outplacement support 
the former chief executive officer of pri entered into a non competition agreement with us  which became effective upon completion of the combination and required a total payment of million over a two year period 
we also identified redundant facilities consisting of sales and support offices  manufacturing facilities and administrative offices 
as such  an accrual of million to terminate lease obligations under these agreements was provided 
these payments represent the fair value of the minimum rental commitment on facilities with lease terms to as discussed above  we accrued an additional million in fiscal related to these facilities 
in addition  we accrued million for amounts to be incurred subsequent to the acquisition related to legal costs to close subsidiaries of pri 
interest income and expense interest income decreased by million  to million  in the year ended september   from million the previous year 
this decrease is due primarily to lower cash balances that were available for investment and lower interest rates that were realized on our investment balances 
interest expense of million for the year ended september  relates primarily to the convertible subordinated notes 
interest expense of million in the prior year relates primarily to the convertible subordinated notes and imputed interest on notes payable related to the e diagnostics and simcon acquisitions 
the notes issued for these acquisitions were settled on july  and may   respectively 
other income expense other expense increased by million  to million  in the year ended september   from million of net other income the previous year 
we incurred losses as a result of the disposal of the shinsung warrants and shares in the amount of million and million  respectively 
income tax provision benefit we recorded a net income tax provision of million in the year ended september  and net income tax provision of million in the year ended september  the tax provision recorded in fiscal was primarily due to foreign withholding taxes 
the tax provision recorded in fiscal was primarily due to the recording of a full valuation allowance of million against our net deferred tax assets 
during  we monitored the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
we completed the acquisitions of gpi  tec sem  zygo  fab air  ias  hermos and pri during the year ended september  the acquisition of pri  the most significant of these transactions  was effective on may  the enlarged company was expected to be profitable based on the implementation of restructuring and cost cutting measures designed to realize the synergies from the combined companies and accordingly we determined the realizability of our deferred tax assets at this time to be more likely than not 
the economic slowdown in the semiconductor industry continued into our fourth quarter of fiscal and updated industry forecasts at this time indicated that the timing and speed of recovery for the sector would be much slower and later than had previously been anticipated  resulting in a downturn of longer and deeper magnitude than had previously been experienced in the semiconductor sector 
given these updated industry forecasts in our fourth fiscal quarter of a continuing state of lower expectations of future revenues and earnings for the foreseeable future  together with the determination that the merger with pri required significantly more consolidation and restructuring activity than anticipated  our updated projections forecasted a loss in fiscal given the magnitude of the loss in fiscal  the loss in fiscal and the projected loss in fiscal 
table of contents  we determined that it was more likely than not that deferred tax assets would not be realized 
accordingly  we recorded a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets in the fourth quarter of fiscal liquidity and capital resources our business is significantly dependent on capital expenditures by semiconductor manufacturers and oem s that are  in turn  dependent on the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductors 
demand for semiconductors is cyclical and has historically experienced periodic downturns 
the semiconductor industry experienced such a downturn that extended from well into the downturn affected revenues  gross margins and operating results 
in response to this downturn  we have implemented cost reduction programs aimed at aligning our ongoing operating costs with our currently expected revenues over the near term 
these cost management initiatives have included consolidating facilities  reductions to headcount  salary and wage reductions and reduced spending 
we believe that the cost reduction programs implemented have aligned costs with revenues 
in the event we are unable to sustain this alignment  additional cost cutting programs may be required in the future 
the cyclical nature of the industry make estimates of future revenues  results of revenues  results of operations and net cash flows inherently uncertain 
at september   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities aggregating million 
this amount was comprised of million of cash and cash equivalents  million of investments in short term marketable securities and million of investments in long term marketable securities 
at september   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities aggregating million 
this amount was comprised of million of cash and cash equivalents  million of investments in short term marketable securities and million of investments in long term marketable securities 
cash and cash equivalents were million at september   an increase of million from september  this increase in cash and cash equivalents was primarily due to cash provided by operations of million and million of net proceeds from the issuance of common stock offset by net purchases of marketable securities of million and million used for capital additions 
cash provided by operations was million for the year ended september   and was primarily attributable to our net income of million  adjusted for non cash depreciation and amortization of million  a charge for the impairment of goodwill of million  compensation expense related to common stock and options of million 
these adjustments were offset by net working capital changes resulting in a usage of cash of million 
this change in working capital was primarily the result of increased accounts receivable balances of million and an increased inventory balance of million 
the increase in accounts receivable is a result of our increased revenue levels in the current fiscal year 
our days sales outstanding decreased to days at september  from days at september   as a result of our continued emphasis on collection efforts 
increased inventory levels of million are a result of the increased need for inventory to manage current revenue levels and are reflective of increased balances of deferred inventory located at customer sites waiting for acceptance 
net payments for restructuring costs of million represent continued payments of severance benefits and lease payments on our vacated facilities 
other changes in working capital included increased accounts payable levels of million  increased accrued compensation and benefits of million resulting from accruals for variable cash compensation plans and decreases in prepaid expenses and other current assets of million as a result of the recognition of deferred project costs in the current year resulting from the completion and acceptance by the customer of a major project for our factory automation software segment 
cash used by investing activities was million for the year ended september   and is principally comprised of net purchases of marketable securities of million and million used for capital additions 
cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended september   and is primarily comprised of million of proceeds from issuances of our common stock of million 
table of contents related to the common stock offering during the year and million from the issuance of stock under our employee stock purchase plan and the exercise of options to purchase our common stock offset by million for the payment of long term debt 
on may   we completed the private placement of million aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated notes due in interest on the notes is paid on june and december of each year 
we made its first interest payment on december  the notes will mature on june  we may redeem the notes at stated premiums 
holders may require us to repurchase the notes upon a change in control of us in certain circumstances 
the notes are convertible at any time prior to maturity  at the option of the holders  into shares of our common stock  at a conversion price of per share  subject to certain adjustments 
the notes are subordinated to our senior indebtedness and structurally subordinated to all indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries 
while we have no significant capital commitments  as we expand our product offerings  we anticipate that we will continue to make capital expenditures to support our business and improve our computer systems infrastructure 
we may also use our resources to acquire companies  technologies or products that complement our business 
at september   we had approximately million of an uncommitted demand promissory note facility still in use  all of it for letters of credit 
our contractual obligations consist of the following in thousands less than one to four to total one year three years five years thereafter contractual obligations operating leases continuing operating leases exited facilities retirement benefit purchase commitments debt interest on convertible subordinated notes total contractual obligations we have an accrual of million related to the retirement benefit to be paid to our former chief executive officer under the terms of his employment agreement 
the amount payable is earned over time and due immediately upon his retirement 
in accordance with his current employment contract  the full retirement benefit as determined by the employment agreement of million is due january  we have non cancelable contracts and purchase orders for inventory of million at september  we believe that our existing resources will be adequate to fund our currently planned working capital and capital expenditure requirements for both the short and long term 
however  the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry makes it difficult for us to predict future liquidity requirements with certainty 
we may be unable to obtain any required additional financing on terms favorable to us  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms  we may be unable to fund our expansion  successfully develop or enhance products  respond to competitive pressure or take advantage of acquisition opportunities  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
recent accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
revised december  consolidation of variable interest entities fin r  which clarifies the application of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  to certain 
table of contents entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support and replaces fasb interpretation no 
fin r provides guidance on the identification of entities for which control is achieved through means other than through voting rights variable interest entities or vies and how to determine when and which business enterprise should consolidate the vie 
in addition  fin r requires that both the primary beneficiary and all other enterprises with a significant variable interest in a vie make additional disclosures 
this interpretation was effective in financial statements of public entities that have interests in variable interest entities or potential variable interest entities commonly referred to as special purpose entities for periods ending after december  application of this pronouncement by public entities for all other types of entities  subject to fin r  is required in financial statements for periods ending after march  the adoption of fin r did not have an impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in september  the emerging issues task force issued eitf no 
 the effect of contingently convertible debt on diluted earnings per share eitf which addressed issuances of contingently convertible debt instruments ccdis  exactly which periods a ccdi impacts eps when the conversion trigger is tripped and the condition that should be used to determine whether the if converted method should be applied if the conversion condition changes 
these securities should be treated as convertible securities and included in a dilutive eps calculation if dilutive  regardless of whether the market price trigger has been met 
the provisions of this issue are expected to be effective for periods ending after december  this consensus would be applied retroactively to instruments outstanding at the date of adoption  effectively restating previously reported eps 
the adoption of the provisions of eitf will reduce diluted eps to the extent our convertible debt is dilutive but is not expected to have any impact on our previously reported eps 
in november  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter fas 
fas amends arb  chapter  to clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted materials spoilage should be recognized as current period charges 
in addition  this statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the provisions of this statement are effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  the adoption of the provisions of fas is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
factors that may affect future results you should carefully consider the risks described below and the other information in this report before deciding to invest in shares of our common stock 
these are the risks and uncertainties we believe are most important for you to consider 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us  which we currently deem immaterial or which are similar to those faced by other companies in our industry or business in general  may also impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks or uncertainties actually occurs  our business  financial condition and operating results would likely suffer 
in that event  the market price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment 
risks relating to our industry due in part to the cyclical nature of the semiconductor manufacturing industry and related industries  we have recently incurred substantial operating losses and may have future losses 
our business is largely dependent on capital expenditures in the semiconductor manufacturing industry and other businesses employing similar manufacturing technology 
the semiconductor manufacturing industry in turn depends on current and anticipated demand for integrated circuits and the products that use them 
in recent years  these businesses have experienced unpredictable and volatile business cycles due in large part to rapid changes in demand and manufacturing capacity for semiconductors 
the semiconductor industry 
table of contents experienced a prolonged downturn  which negatively impacted us from the third quarter of fiscal until the beginning of calendar as a result of that downturn  our oem and end user customers significantly reduced the rate at which they purchased our products and services 
that reduced demand adversely affected our sales volume and gross margins and resulted in substantial operating losses during fiscal  and these losses were due to  among other things  writedowns for obsolete inventory and expenses related to investments in research and development and global service and support necessary to maintain our competitive position 
although our business became profitable during  there appears to be a downward trend again developing in the semiconductor industry 
we could experience future operating losses during an industry downturn and any period of uncertain demand 
if an industry downturn continues for an extended period of time  our business could be materially harmed 
conversely  if demand improves rapidly  we could have insufficient inventory and manufacturing capacity to meet our customer needs on a timely basis  which could result in the loss of customers and various other expenses that could reduce gross margins and profitability 
we cannot assure you as to whether we will be able to sustain the profitability we have recently achieved 
risks relating to brooks our operating results could fluctuate significantly  which could negatively impact our business 
our revenues  operating margins and other operating results could fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter depending upon a variety of factors  including demand for our products as a result of the cyclical nature of the semiconductor manufacturing industry and the markets upon which it depends or otherwise  changes in the timing and terms of product orders by our customers as a result of our customer concentration or otherwise  changes in the mix of products and services that we offer  timing and market acceptance of our new product introductions  delays or problems in the planned introduction of new products  our competitors announcements of new products  services or technological innovations  which can  among other things  render our products less competitive due to the rapid technological change in our industry  the timing and related costs of any acquisitions  divestitures or other strategic transactions  our ability to reduce our costs due to decreased demand for our products and services  disruptions in our manufacturing process or in the supply of components to us  write offs for excess or obsolete inventory  and competitive pricing pressures 
as a result of these risks  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our revenue and operating results may not be meaningful  and that these comparisons may not be an accurate indicator of our future performance 
if our quarterly results fluctuate significantly  our business could be harmed 
our restructuring activities and cost reduction measures may be insufficient to offset reduced demand for our products and may have materially harmed our business 
primarily in response to reduced demand for our products  during the recent downturn in the semiconductor industry  we implemented cost reductions and other restructuring activities throughout our organization 
these cost saving measures included several reductions in workforce  salary and wage reductions  reduced inventory levels  consolidation of our manufacturing facilities to our chelmsford  massachusetts facilities and the discontinuation of certain product lines and information technology projects 
although we 
table of contents had net income in fiscal when the semiconductor industry rebounded  we cannot assure you that these cost reductions will be sufficient to offset the reduced sales levels we may experience in fiscal in the face of a potential new downturn 
our failure to adequately reduce our costs  without our products sales levels staying at least level with fiscal  could materially harm our business and prospects and our ability to maintain our competitive position 
our restructuring activities may have harmed us because they may have resulted in reduced productivity by our employees and increased difficulty in retaining and hiring a sufficient number of qualified employees familiar with our products and processes and the locales in which we operate 
delays and technical difficulties in our products and operations may result in lost revenue  lost profit  delayed or limited market acceptance or product liability claims 
as the technology in our systems and manufacturing operations has become more complex and customized  it has become increasingly difficult to design and integrate these technologies into our newly introduced systems  procure adequate supplies of specialized components  train technical and manufacturing personnel and make timely transitions to volume manufacturing 
due to the complexity of our manufacturing processes  we have on occasion failed to meet our customers delivery or performance criteria  and as a result we have deferred revenue recognition  incurred late delivery penalties and had higher warranty and service costs 
we cannot guarantee that we will not experience these problems in the future 
we may be unable to recover expenses we incur due to changes or cancellations of customized orders 
there are also substantial unanticipated costs associated with ensuring that new products function properly and reliably in the early stages of their life cycle 
these costs have been and could in the future be greater than expected as a result of these complexities 
our failure to control these costs could materially harm our business and profitability 
because many of our customers use our products for business critical applications  any errors  defects or other performance or technical problems could result in financial or other damage to our customers and could significantly impair their operations 
our customers could seek to recover damages from us for losses related to any of these issues 
a product liability claim brought against us  even if not successful  would likely be time consuming and costly to defend and could adversely affect our marketing efforts 
if we do not continue to introduce new products and services that reflect advances in technology in a timely manner  our products and services will become obsolete and our operating results will suffer 
our success is dependent on our ability to respond to the rapid rate of technological change present in the semiconductor manufacturing industry 
the success of our product introduction and development depends on our ability to accurately identify and define new market opportunities and products  obtain market acceptance of our products  such as onefab amhs  timely innovate  develop and commercialize new technologies and applications  adjust to changing market conditions  differentiate our offerings from our competitors offerings  continue to develop a comprehensive  integrated product and service strategy  and properly price our products and services 
if we cannot succeed in responding in a timely manner to technological and or market changes  we could lose our competitive position which could materially harm our business and our prospects 
the global nature of our business exposes us to multiple risks 
for the year ended september   approximately of our revenues were derived from sales outside north america 
we expect that international sales  including increased sales in asia  will continue to 
table of contents account for a significant portion of our revenues 
as a result of our international operations  we are exposed to many risks and uncertainties  including difficulties in staffing  managing and supporting operations in multiple countries  longer sales cycles and time to collection  tariff and international trade barriers  fewer legal protections for intellectual property and contract rights abroad  different and changing legal and regulatory requirements in the jurisdictions in which we operate  government currency control and restrictions on repatriation of earnings  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange and interest rates  and political and economic changes  hostilities and other disruptions in regions where we operate 
negative developments in any of these areas in one or more countries could result in a reduction in demand for our products  the cancellation or delay of orders already placed  threats to our intellectual property  difficulty in collecting receivables  and a higher cost of doing business  any of which could materially harm our business and profitability 
our business could be materially harmed if we fail to adequately integrate the operations of the businesses that we may acquire 
we have made in the past  and may make in the future  acquisitions or significant investments in businesses with complementary products  services and or technologies 
our acquisitions present numerous risks  including difficulties in integrating the operations  technologies  products and personnel of the acquired companies and realizing the anticipated synergies of the combined businesses  defining and executing a comprehensive product strategy  managing the risks of entering markets or types of businesses in which we have limited or no direct experience  the potential loss of key employees  customers and strategic partners of acquired companies  unanticipated problems or latent liabilities  such as problems with the quality of the installed base of the target company s products  problems associated with compliance with the target company s existing contracts  difficulties in managing geographically dispersed operations  and the diversion of management s attention from normal daily operations of the business 
if we acquire a new business  we may be required to expend significant funds  incur additional debt or issue additional securities  which may negatively affect our operations and be dilutive to our stockholders 
in periods following an acquisition  we will be required to evaluate goodwill and acquisition related intangible assets for impairment 
when such assets are found to be impaired  they will be written down to estimated fair value  with a charge against earnings 
for example  we were required to record impairment charges on acquired intangible assets and goodwill aggregating million in fiscal the failure to adequately address these risks could materially harm our business and financial results 
failure to retain key personnel could impair our ability to execute our business strategy 
the continuing service of our executive officers and essential engineering  technical and management personnel  together with our ability to attract and retain such personnel  is an important factor in our continuing ability to execute our strategy 
there is substantial competition to attract such employees and the 
table of contents loss of any such key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
the same could be true if we were to experience a high turnover rate among engineering and technical personnel and we were unable to replace them 
risks relating to our customers we face substantial competition which may lead to price pressure and otherwise adversely affect our sales 
we face substantial competition throughout the world in each of our product areas 
our primary competitors range from large companies such as asyst shinko  daifuku  hp compaq  ibm  murata  rorze  tdk and yaskawa to smaller  regional companies 
we also compete with oem manufacturers  such as applied materials  that satisfy their semiconductor and flat panel display handling needs internally rather than by purchasing systems or modules from a supplier like us 
some of our competitors have substantially greater financial resources and more extensive engineering  manufacturing  marketing and customer support capabilities than we do 
we expect our competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products and to introduce new products and technologies that could adversely affect sales of our current and future products and services 
new products and technologies developed by our competitors or more efficient production of their products could require us to make significant price reductions to avoid losing orders 
if we fail to respond adequately to pricing pressures or fail to develop products with improved performance or developments with respect to the other factors on which we compete  we could lose customers or orders 
if we are unable to compete effectively  our business and prospects could be materially harmed 
because we rely on a limited number of customers for a large portion of our revenues  the loss of one or more of these customers could materially harm our business 
we receive a significant portion of our revenues in each fiscal period from a relatively limited number of customers  and that trend is likely to continue 
sales to our ten largest customers accounted for approximately of our total revenues in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal as the semiconductor manufacturing industry continues to consolidate and further shifts to foundries which manufacture semiconductors designed by others  the number of our potential customers could decrease  which would increase our dependence on our limited number of customers 
the loss of one or more of these major customers or a decrease in orders from one of these customers could materially affect our revenue  business and reputation 
because of the lengthy sales cycles of many of our products  we may incur significant expenses before we generate any revenues related to those products 
our customers may need several months to test and evaluate our products 
this increases the possibility that a customer may decide to cancel or change plans  which could reduce or eliminate our sales to that customer 
as a result of this lengthy sales cycle  we may incur significant research and development expenses  and selling  general and administrative expenses before we generate the related revenues for these products  and we may never generate the anticipated revenues if our customer cancels or changes its plans 
in addition  many of our products will not be sold directly to the end user but will be components of other products 
as a result  we rely on oems of our products to select our products from among alternative offerings to be incorporated into their equipment at the design stage  so called design ins 
the oem s decisions often precede the generation of volume sales  if any  by a year or more 
moreover  if we are unable to achieve these design ins from oems  we would have difficulty selling our products to that oem because changing suppliers involves significant cost  time  effort and risk on the part of that oem 
customers generally do not make long term commitments to purchase our products and our customers may cease purchasing our products at any time 
sales of our products are often made pursuant to individual purchase orders and not under long term commitments and contracts 
our customers frequently do not provide any assurance of minimum or future 
table of contents sales and are not prohibited from purchasing products from our competitors at any time 
accordingly  we are exposed to competitive pricing pressures on each order 
our customers also engage in the practice of purchasing products from more than one manufacturer to avoid dependence on sole source suppliers for certain of their needs 
the existence of these practices makes it more difficult for us to gain new customers and to win repeat business from existing customers 
other risks we may be subject to claims of infringement of third party intellectual property rights  or demands that we license third party technology  which could result in significant expense and prevent us from using our technology 
we rely upon patents  trade secret laws  confidentiality procedures  copyrights  trademarks and licensing agreements to protect our technology 
due to the rapid technological change that characterizes the semiconductor and flat panel display process equipment industries  we believe that the improvement of existing technology  reliance upon trade secrets and unpatented proprietary know how and the development of new products may be as important as patent protection in establishing and maintaining competitive advantage 
to protect trade secrets and know how  it is our policy to require all technical and management personnel to enter into nondisclosure agreements 
we cannot guarantee that these efforts will meaningfully protect our trade secrets 
there has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the semiconductor related industries 
we have in the past been  and may in the future be  notified that we may be infringing intellectual property rights possessed by other third parties 
we cannot guarantee that infringement claims by third parties or other claims for indemnification by customers or end users of our products resulting from infringement claims will not be asserted in the future or that such assertions  if proven to be true  will not materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
particular elements of our technology could be found to infringe on the intellectual property rights or patents of others 
other companies may hold or obtain patents on inventions or otherwise claim proprietary rights to technology necessary to our business 
for example  twice in and once in we received notice from general signal corporation that it believed that certain of our tool automation products infringed general signal s patent rights 
we believe the matters identified in the notice from general signal were also the subject of a dispute between general signal and applied materials  inc  which was settled in november there are also claims that have been made by asyst technologies inc that certain products we acquired through acquisition embody intellectual property owned by asyst 
to date no action has been instituted against us directly by general signal  applied materials or asyst 
we cannot predict the extent to which we might be required to seek licenses or alter our products so that they no longer infringe the rights of others 
we also cannot guarantee that the terms of any licenses we may be required to seek will be reasonable 
similarly  changing our products or processes to avoid infringing the rights of others may be costly or impractical and could detract from the value of our products 
if a judgment of infringement were obtained against us  we could be required to pay substantial damages and a court could issue an order preventing us from selling one or more of our products 
further the cost and diversion of management attention brought about by such litigation could be substantial  even if we were to prevail 
any of these events could result in significant expense to us and may materially harm our business and our prospects 
our failure to protect our intellectual property could adversely affect our future operations 
our ability to compete is significantly affected by our ability to protect our intellectual property 
existing trade secret  trademark and copyright laws offer only limited protection  and certain of our patents could be invalidated or circumvented 
in addition  the laws of some countries in which our products are or may be developed  manufactured or sold may not fully protect our products 
we cannot guarantee that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property will be adequate to prevent the misappropriation of our technology 
other companies could independently develop similar or superior technology without violating our 
table of contents intellectual property rights 
in the future  it may be necessary to engage in litigation or like activities to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights of others  including our customers 
this could require us to incur significant expenses and to divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from our business operations 
if the site of the majority of our manufacturing operations were to experience a significant disruption in operations  our business could be materially harmed 
most of our manufacturing facilities are concentrated in one location 
if the operations of these facilities were disrupted as a result of a natural disaster  fire  power or other utility outage  work stoppage or other similar event  our business could be seriously harmed because we may be unable to manufacture and ship products and parts to our customers in a timely fashion 
our business could be materially harmed if one or more key suppliers fail to deliver key components 
we currently obtain many of our key components on an as needed  purchase order basis from numerous suppliers 
we do not generally have long term supply contracts with these suppliers  and many of them have undertaken cost containment measures in light of the recent downturn in the semiconductor industry 
in the event of an industry upturn these suppliers could face significant challenges in delivering components on a timely basis 
our inability to obtain components in required quantities or of acceptable quality could result in delays or reductions in product shipments to our customers 
this could cause us to lose customers  result in delayed or lost revenue and otherwise materially harm our business 
our stock price is volatile 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated widely 
for example  between may  and september   the closing price of our common stock dropped from approximately to per share and between april  and september   the price of our common stock rose from approximately to per share 
during fiscal our stock price fluctuated between a high of per share and a low of per share 
the market price of our common stock reached a low of approximately on april  consequently  the current market price of our common stock may not be indicative of future market prices  and we may be unable to sustain or increase the value of an investment in our common stock 
factors affecting our stock price may include variations in operating results from quarter to quarter  changes in earnings estimates by analysts or our failure to meet analysts expectations  changes in the market price per share of our public company customers  market conditions in the semiconductor industry or the industries upon which it depends  general economic conditions  political changes  hostilities or health risks such as sars  low trading volume of our common stock  and the number of firms making a market in our common stock 
in addition  the stock market has recently experienced significant price and volume fluctuations 
these fluctuations have particularly affected the market prices of the securities of high technology companies like ours 
these market fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

table of contents provisions in our organizational documents  contracts and convertible subordinated notes due may make it difficult for someone to acquire control of us
