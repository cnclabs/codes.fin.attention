item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in addition to historical information  the following discussion contains forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ substantially from those referred to herein due to a number of factors  including but not limited to risks described under risk factors  and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we design  develop and manufacture innovative microelectronic and display components and systems for inclusion in high technology products used in the military  industrial  and commercial markets 
our microelectronic solutions include advanced semiconductor and state of the art multi chip packaging  as well as our proprietary process for applying anti tamper protection to mission critical semiconductor components in military applications 
our display solutions include enhanced flat panel display products  interface devices and electromechanical assemblies 
our customers  which include military prime contractors in the united states and europe as well as commercial oems  outsource many of their microelectronic and display components and systems to us as a result of the combination of our design  development and manufacturing expertise 
we were formed as a result of the merger between bowmar and edi in october at the time of the merger  bowmar was a manufacturer of high reliability electronic components and interface and mechanical devices  mainly for military applications 
edi was a manufacturer of commercial memory products for the telecommunications and networking markets and also had a small ruggedized display business serving the military and industrial markets 
this merger provided us with a diversified platform to expand our product offerings within both the military and commercial markets 
in order to complement our military industrial display business  we acquired panelview  a designer and manufacturer of enhanced commercial flat panel display products  in january following the acquisition  we consolidated our display operations into our panelview subsidiary 
in january  we acquired ids  a designer and manufacturer of membrane keypads  flexible circuits  sensors  control panels  and handheld and desktop electronic devices 
this acquisition allowed us to expand our interface device product offerings and enhance our subsystem solutions 
in addition  with ids s design and manufacturing capabilities we can now offer fully integrated system level solutions 
executive summary net sales for the fiscal year ended october  were approximately million  compared to net sales of million for fiscal the decrease in fiscal was primarily caused by a decline of approximately million in sales of our commercial display products 
the decline in commercial display net sales was attributable to a reduction in orders from garmin and ge medical as they changed their manufacturing strategies during the fourth quarter of fiscal we have expanded our customer base to replace net sales to garmin and ge medical 
our risk mitigation plan for our display business continues to show the positive results we were expecting 
backlog for the display segment increased million to million at october  as compared to million at september  for the year ended october   we had new orders of approximately million  which equates to a book to bill ratio of for the year 
display segment orders were approximately million and orders for the microelectronic segment were approximately million 
new orders for our microelectronic segment s anti tamper process technology were approximately million for the year and we had sales of approximately million 
we currently expect to see growth for anti tamper technology products over the next several years 
we believe our financial results for the year  especially the latter half  were impacted by a shift in military spending priorities 
we believe a reallocation of government funds to other military priorities resulted in a delay of orders of military products for our microelectronic segment 
this delay caused lower year over year sales and profits for our microelectronic segment and may cause lower year over year comparisons for the next several quarters 
our gross margins decreased year over year to approximately for fiscal from approximately for fiscal the primary reason for this decrease was lower margins in our microelectronic segment  which decreased from in fiscal to in the reason for the decline was due to a shift in product mix to lower margin memory products from higher margin microprocessor products  lower sales of military microelectronic 
table of contents products  higher production costs for our military products  and a higher percentage of commercial memory products as a percent of microelectronic segment sales 
the trend of lower margin percentages may continue in fiscal if sales of commercial products  both in the display and microelectronic segment  increase during the year  and sales of military microelectronic products stay the same  or decrease 
display segment gross margins also decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal gross margins for our display segment products continue to come under pressure from both domestic and asian competition  and  while we are implementing manufacturing strategies to improve our competitive position  it may be difficult to continue to maintain current gross margins in the future 
our overall production has  at times  been affected by longer lead times for certain components  which may affect the timing and cost of sales during the year 
the availability and price of memory components  based on supply and demand  will go up and down on a monthly or quarterly basis 
when demand exceeds supply  prices will rise and lead times will lengthen 
when supply exceeds demands  prices will fall and lead times will shorten 
overall  the semiconductor market is expected to be soft through the first half of and is expected to rise slowly in the second half of at this time  memory components are available and prices have stablized 
the availability of liquid crystal displays has increased and prices have significantly decreased 
this is expected to last for the first half of fiscal net income for fiscal year was approximately million compared to net income of approximately million for fiscal the decline was primarily due to the decline in net sales and gross margin described above 
segments our product and market diversification as well as our broad customer base have allowed us to maintain relative sales stability and profitability during the recent economic downturn 
the following table shows our historical net sales and the percent of net sales by our two business segments and the markets they serve in thousands microelectronic segment military industrial market commercial market display segment military industrial market commercial market total microelectronic segment military industrial market commercial market display segment military industrial market commercial market total for the year ended october   ids contributed approximately million of net sales to the commercial market of our microelectronic segment and approximately million of net sales to the commercial market of our display segment 
for the year ended september   ids contributed approximately million of net sales to the commercial market of our microelectronic segment and approximately million of net sales to the commercial market of our display segment 
the foregoing information includes ids s net sales from the date of acquisition on january  
table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the most significant accounting estimates inherent in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements include the following items we sell microelectronic and display products primarily to military prime contractors and commercial original equipment manufacturers 
a small portion of our products are also sold through distributors or resellers 
we recognize revenue on product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement with the customer exists  title to the product has passed to the customer  which usually occurs at time of shipment  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility of the related billing is reasonably assured 
advance payments from customers are deferred and recognized when the related products are shipped 
revenue relating to products sold to distributors or resellers who either have return rights or where the company has a history of accepting product returns are deferred and recognized when the distributor or reseller sells the product to the end customer 
we also provide limited design services pursuant to related customer purchase orders and generally recognize the associated revenue as such services are performed 
however  it may be deferred until certain elements are completed 
we may from time to time enter into certain arrangements that contain multiple elements such as performing limited design services accompanied with follow on manufacturing of related products 
we allocate revenue to the elements based on relative fair value  and recognize revenue for each element when the there is evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
arrangements with multiple elements that are not considered separate units of accounting require deferral of revenue until certain other elements have been delivered or the services have been performed 
the amount of the revenue recognized is impacted by our judgment as to whether an arrangement includes multiple elements  and whether the elements are considered separate units of accounting 
historically  we have experienced fluctuations in the demand for our products based on cyclical fluctuations in the microelectronic and display markets 
these fluctuations may cause inventory on hand to lose value or become obsolete 
in order to present the appropriate inventory value on our financial statements  we identify slow moving or obsolete inventories and record provisions to write down such inventories to net realizable value 
these provisions are based on management s comparison of the value of inventory on hand against expected future sales 
if future sales are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
we record trade accounts receivable at the invoiced amount and they do not bear interest 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we make these estimates based on an analysis of accounts receivable using available information on our customers financial status and payment histories 
historically  bad debt losses have not differed materially from our estimates 
write offs against the allowance totaled approximately  in fiscal   in fiscal and  in fiscal we maintain a pension plan for eligible union employees at our fort wayne  indiana facility 
to account for the cost of this plan  we make estimates concerning the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  and discount rates to be used to calculate future benefit obligations 
changes in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets affect the amount of investment income expected to be earned in the future 
we base our related estimates using historical data on the rate of return from equities and fixed income investments  as well as projections for future returns on such investments 
if the actual returns on plan assets do not equal the estimated amounts  we may have to fund future benefit obligations with additional contributions to the plan 
changes in the discount rate affect the value of the plan s future benefit obligations 
a lower discount rate increases the liabilities of the plan because it raises the value of future benefit obligations 
this will also cause an increase in pension expense recognized 
we use published bond yields to estimate the discount rate used for calculating the value of future benefit obligations 
we account for goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which requires goodwill to be tested for impairment on an annual basis and more frequently in certain circumstances and written down when impaired 
we completed our transitional testing for goodwill impairment upon adoption of sfas  and our annual testing for fiscal and and determined that our recorded goodwill was not impaired 
goodwill recorded was million and million at october  and september   respectively 
furthermore  sfas requires purchased intangible assets other than goodwill to be amortized over their useful lives unless these lives are determined to be indefinite 

table of contents purchased intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization 
amortization is computed over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets  generally two to fifteen years 
we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets are recognized  net of any valuation allowance  for deductible temporary differences and net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and  if necessary  establish a valuation allowance 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain operating data expressed as a percentage of net sales net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses selling  general and administrative research and development amortization of goodwill amortization of intangible assets total operating expenses operating income interest expense interest income income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income fiscal year ended october  compared to fiscal year ended september  net sales net sales were million for the year ended october   a decrease of million  or  from million for the year ended september  military industrial sales in the microelectronic segment were million for the year ended october   a decrease of million  or approximately  from million for the year ended september  the decrease in sales was primarily due to a significant one time order of approximately million in fiscal to a military prime contractor related to the falcon edge program and as a result of the shift in military spending priorities which lowered the volume of sales 
we expect sales to military customers to remain flat or decrease slightly in fiscal as compared to fiscal commercial sales in the microelectronic segment were million for the year ended october   an increase of million  or approximately from million for the year ended september  the growth was primarily attributable to products used in the high end server applications and product sold to a hotel industry supplier for their entertainment video systems 
we expect commercial sales in the microelectronic segment to grow in fiscal 
table of contents military industrial sales in the display segment were million for the year ended october   an increase of million  or approximately  from million for the year ended september  the increase was due to increased requirements for products used in the commercial aviation industry  which resulted in more product being sold 
we expect military industrial sales in the display segment in fiscal to be consistent with sales in fiscal commercial sales in the display segment were million for the year ended october   a decrease of million  or approximately  from million for the year ended september  the decrease primarily comes from the loss of orders from ge medical and garmin  both of whom changed their manufacturing strategies in the fourth quarter of this was offset by increases in sales of displays for portable patient monitors  tablet personal computers and point of service terminals 
we expect commercial sales in the display segment to remain flat in fiscal northrup grumman accounted for approximately million  or  of our microelectronic segment sales compared to approximately million  or  of our microelectronic segment sales 
no other customer accounted for more than of segment or total net sales for these periods 
in  approximately million  or  of our display segment net sales came from whirlpool corporation 
approximately million  or  of net sales for our display segment came from garmin  compared to million  or  of net sales while ge medical accounted for approximately million  or  of display segment net sales compared to approximately million  or  of display segment net sales 
our sales to garmin and ge medical declined significantly during fiscal due to a shift in their manufacturing strategies 
the majority of our sales are not subject to seasonal fluctuations over the course of a year 
sales of our membrane keypad products  which totaled approximately million in fiscal and million in fiscal year  are subject to seasonal fluctuations relating to home appliance sales in the spring and fall 
gross profit gross profit was million for the year ended october   a decrease of million or approximately from million for the year ended september  gross margin as a percentage of net sales was approximately for the year ended october   compared to approximately for the year ended september  gross profit for the microelectronic segment was million for the year ended october   a decrease of million  or approximately  from million for the year ended september  the majority of the decrease in gross profit came from a decrease in military industrial sales in the microelectronic segment 
gross margin as a percentage of microelectronic segment sales was approximately for the year ended october   compared to approximately for the year ended september  the product mix in the microelectronic segment shifted to a greater number of commercial products  which have a lower selling price and lower gross margin than military products 
gross profit for the display segment was million for the year ended october   a decrease of million  or approximately  from million for the year ended september  gross margin as a percentage of display segment sales was approximately for the year ended october   compared to approximately for the year ended september  gross margins continue to come under pressure from both domestic and asian competition 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses consist mainly of compensation expense  selling expenses  including commissions  information technology expenses and corporate administrative expenses 
selling  general and 
table of contents administrative expenses were million for the year ended october   an increase of million  or approximately  from million for the year ended september  this increase was primarily due to a million increase in general and administrative expenses  and an increase in selling expenses of million over the comparable period 
general and administrative expenses increased mainly because of higher professional fees in connection with sarbanes oxley requirements  a million insurance deductible payment for legal fees charged in connection with the shareholder litigation  a fixed asset write off of million  an accounts receivable reserve of million pertaining to display shipments to a commercial customer  and million incurred in residual transition costs related to the shut down of our massachusetts location 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to approximately for the year ended october  from for the year ended september   the result of higher expenses and lower revenue 
we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in fiscal due to costs associated with sarbanes oxley and to anticipated insurance premium adjustments as a result of our shareholder litigation 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist primarily of compensation for our engineering personnel  consulting expenses and project materials 
research and development expenses were million for the year ended october   consistent with the million for the year ended september  expenses in the microelectronic segment decreased by million primarily due to the closure of our massachusetts location  and increased million in the display segment due to the continued investment in new products to offset the loss of orders from ge medical and garmin 
as a percentage of sales  research and development expenses have remained consistent and average approximately of net sales 
we are committed to research and development of new and existing products and expect research and development expenses to remain at approximately the same percentage of net sales in the future 
ongoing product development projects for the microelectronic segment include new packaging designs for memory products including synchronous dynamic random access memory sdram  and synchronous static random access memory ssram  as well as the latest technology  double data rate ddr ii memory modules  along with microprocessor modules and ball grid array products  continuing development of anti tamper technology for microelectronic products  next generation memory and power personal computer products assembled in various multichip packages to be used in both commercial and military markets  and qualification of new semiconductor products

we paid off the ids debt in the fourth quarter of fiscal and have no borrowings outstanding as of october  interest income interest income consists of interest earned on our cash balances in various types of interest bearing accounts  and interest earned on investments in short term marketable securities 
interest income was  for the year ended october   an increase of  compared to  for the year ended september  this increase was attributable to the increase in cash equivalents between periods primarily as a result of cash flows from operations and the proceeds received from our stock offering which was completed in july amortization of intangible assets we adopted sfas on september   and discontinued amortization of goodwill at that time 
intangible asset amortization for the year ended october  totaled million almost entirely related to intangible assets acquired from ids 

table of contents income taxes income tax expense consists of current and deferred federal and state income taxes 
income tax expense was million for the year ended october   compared to million for the year ended september  the effective tax rate was approximately for the year ended october   compared to approximately for the year ended september  the decrease in the effective tax rate in was a result of additional available research and development credits 
in october  president bush signed into law the working families tax relief act of the act 
included as part of the act is a provision that reinstates the research tax credit that expired on june  the reinstatement is retroactive in june   however  since the act was signed subsequent to october   research tax credits subsequent to june  will be recognized in the company s first quarter of fiscal this amount is not expected to be material 
in october  congress passed the american jobs creation act of the act  which will eliminate the extraterritorial income exclusion  and will provide a deduction from taxable income equal to a stipulated percentage of qualified income from domestic production activities  referred to as the manufacturer deduction 
the extraterritorial income exclusion will be phased out through  and the manufacturer deduction will be phased in through the company does not believe the act will have a significant impact on its effective rate in fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september net sales net sales were million for the year ended september   an increase of million  or  from million for the year ended september  net sales for the year ended september  included million from ids

recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fin no 
r  consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb this interpretation  which replaces fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  provides guidance on the identification of entities of which control is achieved through means other than voting rights variable interest entities or vies and how to determine when and which business enterprise should consolidate the vie the primary beneficiary 
special provisions apply to enterprises that have fully or partially applied interpretation prior to issuance of this interpretation 
otherwise  application of this interpretation or interpretation is required in financial statements of public entities that have interests in variable interest entities or potential variable interest entities commonly referred to as special purpose entities for periods ending after december  application by public entities other than small business issuers for all other types 
table of contents of entities is required in financial statements for periods ending after march  in some instances  enterprises have the option of applying or continuing to apply interpretation for a short period of time before applying this interpretation 
the implementation of this interpretation did not have a material impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
in december  fasb issued sfas  inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter this statement amends the guidance in arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage 
this statement requires that those items be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of abnormal 
in addition  this statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the provisions of this statement shall be effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  the implementation of this statement is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of october   we had no borrowings on our revolving line of credit with bank one 
should we borrow against the line  interest charged on these borrowings would be at either the bank s prime rate or libor plus 
during fiscal  the bank s prime rate averaged and was as of october  we are subject to changes in the prime rate based on federal reserve actions and general market interest fluctuations 
we are also subject to fluctuations in the libor rate 
as of october   the libor rate was approximately 
should we begin borrowing against the credit line  annual interest expense at would be approximately  for every million borrowed 
a hypothetical increased rate change of would increase interest expense by approximately  per million borrowed on an annual basis 
we believe that moderate interest rate increases will not have a material adverse impact on our results of operations  liquidity or financial position 
we believe that we are not subject in any material way to other forms of market risk  such as foreign currency exchange risk on foreign customer purchase orders we accept payment in us dollars only or commodity price risk
