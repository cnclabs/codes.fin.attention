item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are the result of the merger of smartforce plc smartforce or smartforce plc and skillsoft corporation 
the new combined skillsoft plc is a global leader in corporate e learning and brings together smartforce s leading portfolio of information technology it e learning content with skillsoft corporation s extensive suite of business skills e learning courseware  as well as its it and business referenceware libraries 
the merger of smartforce and skillsoft corporation the merger closed on september  for accounting purposes  the merger was accounted for as a reverse acquisition  with skillsoft corporation as the accounting acquirer 
the historical financial statements of skillsoft corporation have become our historical financial statements  and the results of operations of skillsoft plc formerly known as smartforce plc are included in our results of operations only from september  for accounting purposes  the purchase price was approximately million which consisted of the value of stock and options issued  and transaction and merger costs 
the excess purchase price over the net tangible assets was primarily allocated to goodwill  content and customer base 
a primary reason for the increase in our revenue and operating expenses from the fiscal year ended january  to the fiscal year ended january  is the inclusion of the operating results of skillsoft plc for the full year ended january  we operate as two reporting segments multi modal learning and retail certification 
these reporting units are not discussed separately as the impact on the comparison of financial results from period to period is not significant 
we are a leading global provider of comprehensive  multi modal e learning content and software products for business and it professionals 
multi modal learning mml solutions offer powerful tools to support and enhance the speed and effectiveness of both formal and informal learning processes 
mml solutions integrate our in depth courseware  learning management platform technology and support services to meet our customers learning needs 
we primarily derive revenue from license agreements under which customers license our products and services 
the pricing for our courses varies based upon the number of course titles or the courseware bundle licensed by a customer  the number of users within the customer s organization and the length of the license agreement generally one  two or three years 
our license agreements permit customers to exchange course titles  generally  on the contract anniversary date 
additional product features  such as hosting and on line mentoring services  are separately licensed for an additional fee 
the pricing for our mml licenses varies based on the choice of mml  content offering selected by the customer  the number of users within the customer s organization and the length of the license agreement 
our mml license provides customers access to a full range of learning products including courseware  referenceware  simulations  mentoring and prescriptive assessment 
a referenceware license from our subsidiary  booksxcom books gives users access to the full library within one or more collections itpro  businesspro  financepro and officeessentials 
the pricing for our referenceware licenses varies based on the collections specified by a customer  the number of users within the customer s organization and the length of the license agreement 
we offer discounts from our ordinary pricing  and purchasers of licenses for larger numbers of courses  for larger user bases or for longer periods generally receive discounts 
generally  customers may amend their license agreements  for an additional fee  to gain access to additional courses or product lines and or to increase the size of the user base 
we also derive revenue from hosting fees for clients that use our solutions on an application service provider asp basis  on line mentoring services and professional services 
in selected circumstances  we derive revenue on a pay for use basis under which some customers are charged based on the number of courses accessed by users 
revenue derived from pay for use contracts has been minimal to date 
we recognize revenue ratably over the license period if the number of courses that a customer has access to is not clearly defined  available  or selected at the inception of the contract  or if the contract has additional undelivered elements for which we do not have vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of the fair value of the various elements 
this may occur if the customer does not specify all licensed courses at the outset  the customer chooses to wait for future licensed courses on a when and if available basis  the customer is given exchange privileges that are exercisable other than on the contract anniversaries  or the customer licenses all courses currently available and to be developed during the term of the arrangement 
nearly all of our contractual arrangements result in the recognition of revenue ratably over the license period  consequently  substantially all of our revenue is recognized on a ratable basis 
we also derive revenue from extranet hosting asp services and online mentoring services 
we recognize revenue related to extranet hosting asp services and online mentoring services on a straight line basis over the period the services are provided 
we generally bill the annual license fee for the first year of a multi year agreement in advance and license fees for subsequent years of multi year license arrangements are billed on the anniversary date of the agreement 
in some circumstances  we offer payment terms of up to six months from the initial shipment date or anniversary date for multi year agreements to our customers 
to the extent that a customer is given extended payment terms  revenue is recognized as cash becomes due  assuming all of the other elements of revenue recognition have been satisfied 
we recognize revenue on referenceware and mml licenses ratably over the term of the agreement  which matches the period the future products or services are delivered 
we commence the recognition of revenue from resellers upon both the final sale to the end user and the receipt of cash from the reseller 
with respect to reseller agreements with minimum commitments  we recognize revenue related to the portion of the minimum commitment that exceeds end user sales at the expiration of the commitment period provided we have received payment 
we provide professional services  including instructor led training  customized content  websites and implementation services 
we recognize professional service revenue as the services are performed 
we record deferred revenue when amounts have been billed in advance of products or services provided 
deferred revenue includes the unrecognized portion of revenue associated with license fees for which we have received payment or for which amounts have been billed and are currently due for payment in days or less for resellers and days or less for direct customers 
in addition  deferred revenue includes amounts  which have been billed and not collected  for which revenue is being recognized ratably over the license period 
in addition  in connection with the merger  we acquired approximately million of deferred revenue which was valued based upon the estimated cost to fulfill the remaining contractual and performance obligations plus a normal operating profit on fulfilling such obligations 
the remaining amount of the acquired deferred revenue as of january  was approximately cost of revenue includes the cost of materials such as storage media  packaging  shipping and handling  cd duplication  the cost of online mentoring and hosting services  royalties and certain infrastructure and occupancy expenses 
we generally recognize these costs as incurred 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits  certain infrastructure and occupancy expenses  fees to consultants and course content development fees 
we account for software development costs in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed  which requires the capitalization of certain computer software development costs incurred after technological feasibility is established 
to date  development costs after establishment of technological feasibility have been immaterial  and we have expensed all software development costs as incurred 
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and benefits  advertising and promotion  travel and certain infrastructure and occupancy expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits  consulting and service expenses  legal expenses  other public company costs and certain infrastructure and occupancy expenses 
deferred compensation consists of two components the value of unvested options assumed in the books acquisition and the merger  and the aggregate difference between the exercise or sale price of common stock options granted or restricted common stock sold during the year ended january  and the fair market value of the common stock as determined for accounting purposes 
the deferred compensation is amortized over the vesting period of the underlying stock option or stock 
amortization of intangibles represents the amortization of intangibles  such as customer value and content  from the books acquisition  the merger and the acquisition of gotrain corp 
restructuring and other non recurring charges consist of compensation costs of severed smartforce employees for services rendered from the date of the merger through january  and prior to such employees termination dates and certain other non recurring compensation costs to terminated and continuing employees 
in addition  in fiscal and  these charges related primarily to the restatement of smartforce s historical financial statements and related sec investigation see risks related to legal proceedings section and consist primarily of professional fees  including legal  accounting and consulting fees 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
however  we believe the accounting policies described below are particularly important to the portrayal and understanding of our financial position and results of operations and require application of significant judgment by our management 
in applying these policies  management uses its judgment in making certain assumptions and estimates 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop no 
software revenue recognition  as amended by sop no 
and sop no 
additionally  for agreements under which we are selling licenses and services  we recognize revenue under eitf application of aicpa statement of position to arrangements that include the right to use software stored on another s hardware and staff accounting bulletin sab no 
revenue recognition 
these statements require that four basic criteria must be satisfied before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement between us and a third party exists  delivery of our product has occurred  the sales price for the product is fixed or determinable  and collection of the sales price is probable 
our management uses its judgment concerning the satisfaction of these criteria  particularly the criteria relating to the determination of when delivery has occurred and the criteria relating to the collectibility of the receivables relating to such sales 
should changes and conditions cause management to determine that these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for any period could be adversely affected 
however  this is mitigated by the fact that the majority of our revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the respective license 
please see the discussion under the overview section concerning how we recognize revenue 
impairment of goodwill we review the carrying value of goodwill on an annual basis based upon the expected future discounted operating cash flows of our business 
our cash flow estimates are based on historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future markets and operating conditions 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates 
the timing and size of impairment charges involves the application of management s judgment and could significantly affect our operating results 
as a result of the merger  one of our largest assets is goodwill 
in response to several factors in the fourth quarter of fiscal  under fas we evaluated the fair value of the goodwill established in connection with the merger and the books acquisition and recorded an impairment charge of approximately million as part of our annual impairment test 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we evaluated the fair value of goodwill and determined that there was no further impairment 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
legal contingencies we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings 
in connection with these legal proceedings  which we discuss in part i item  and in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  management periodically reviews estimates of potential costs to be incurred by us in connection with the adjudication or settlement  if any  of these proceedings 
these estimates are developed in consultation with our outside counsel and are based on an analysis of potential litigation outcomes and settlement strategies 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  loss contingencies are accrued if  in the opinion of management  an adverse outcome is probable and such outcome can be reasonably estimated 
in accordance with sfas no 
 gain contingencies are accrued if  in the opinion of management  a favorable outcome is probable and such outcome can be reasonably estimated 
we note that legal costs are expensed as incurred

as combined company revenue is only included after the closing of the merger the fiscal year ended january  does not include a full year of combined company revenue 
for the fiscal year ended january  renewal rates improved reflecting increased customer satisfaction  partially offset by a cautious corporate spending environment 
we exited the year ended january  with noncancellable backlog  consisting of deferred revenue and committed contracts  of approximately million as compared to million a year ago 
the increase in noncancellable backlog is due primarily to improved renewal rates  expanded offerings for multi modal learning customers and new customers 
fiscal year ended january  change revenue united states    international    total    revenue increased by and in the year ended january  in the united states and internationally  respectively  as compared to the year ended january  the united states represented and of revenue for the years ended january  and  respectively 
fiscal year ended january  change revenue multi modal learning    retail certification    total    the multi modal learning segment represented of revenues for both the year ended january  and  respectively 
costs and expenses cost of revenue increased million  or to million in the fiscal year ended january  from million in the fiscal year ended january  cost of revenue as a percentage of total revenue was in the fiscal year ended january  versus in the fiscal year ended january  the increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to the increase in revenue from fiscal to fiscal  increased costs of supporting the legacy smartforce hosting business and royalty fees associated with the legacy smartforce it product line 
the decrease in percentage of revenue was primarily due to cost efficiencies  primarily from reduced infrastructure costs  achieved as a result of the merger 
research and development increased million  or to million in the fiscal year ended january  from million in the fiscal year ended january  this increase was due in part to the addition of smartforce s research and development organization 
in addition  we incurred million in incremental costs associated with modifying the smartforce content to be compliant with skillsoft standards and practices and million in incremental research and development costs associated with our initiatives related to content offerings and improvements and platform improvements 
we believe that these incremental costs are substantially complete at january  we believe our outsourcing strategy for some of our courses  which allows us to offer a broader set of content  provides us significant flexibility to control these costs 
research and development expenses as a percentage of total revenue decreased to in the fiscal year ended january  from in the fiscal year ended january  with the substantial completion of the incremental investment in research and development we expect research and development expenses to decrease in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenue in the fiscal year ending january  selling and marketing expenses increased million  or to million in the fiscal year ended january  from million in the fiscal year ended january  selling and marketing expenses increased due to the addition of smartforce s sales and marketing organization and related costs 
selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenue decreased to in the fiscal year ended january  from in the fiscal year ended january  the large percentage decrease was primarily due to the significant increase in revenue from fiscal to fiscal we believe that a significant investment in selling and marketing to expand our distribution channels worldwide is required to remain competitive  and we therefore expect selling and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars  but decrease as a percentage of total revenue over the next twelve months 
general and administrative expenses increased million  or to million in the fiscal year ended january  from million in the fiscal year ended january  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue decreased to in the fiscal year ended january  from in the fiscal year ended january  general and administrative expenses increased in absolute dollars primarily due to approximately million of increased costs associated with being a public company  including legal  audit  insurance and sarbanes oxley act compliance 
the remainder of the increase was primarily due to the impact of a full year of additional personnel related costs due to the merger 
the large percentage decrease from fiscal to fiscal was mainly due to a significant increase in revenue in fiscal we anticipate that general and administrative expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars due primarily to increases in the costs of operating as a public company partially offset by a decrease in litigation related legal expenses over the next twelve months 
litigation settlement expenses were million in the fiscal year ended january  this related primarily to the settlements of the securities class action litigation million  the netg litigation million  the class action litigation million and the iplearn litigation million 
stock based compensation expense increased  or to million in the fiscal year ended january  from million in the fiscal year ended january  the expense relates to amortization of deferred compensation resulting from granting of stock options to employees at exercise prices below the fair market value of the stock and the sales of restricted common stock with sales prices below the fair market value of the stock 
the stock options granted and restricted stock sold at prices below fair market value of the stock were granted by skillsoft corporation prior to its initial public offering and by books prior to its acquisition by skillsoft corporation in december in addition we recorded a one time compensation charge of  in the fiscal year ended january  due to the extension of certain option agreements until the registration statement on form s covering such option agreements  which was suspended as a result of our delay in filing a form k a containing the historical smartforce financial statements  was again available for use 
amortization of intangible assets increased million  or  to million in the fiscal year ended january  from million in the fiscal year ended january  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements restructuring and other non recurring charges decreased million  or  to million in the year ended january  from million in the fiscal year ended january  the restructuring and non recurring charges relate to the merger 
the restructuring costs primarily consist of compensation costs for certain terminated smartforce employees 
the other non recurring charges primarily consist of costs directly related to the restatement of the smartforce historical financial statements which was completed in the fiscal year ended january  in addition  other non recurring charges include costs related to the ongoing sec investigation and the securities class action lawsuits 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we evaluated the fair value of goodwill related to the merger 
we prepared a cash flow analysis by reporting segment comparing the discounted cash flows to the net book values of the direct assets  goodwill and intangibles associated with the two reporting units multi modal learning and retail certification 
the discounted cash flows supported the direct assets  goodwill and intangibles of the multi modal learning business unit and the retail certification reporting unit 
at january   we concluded there was no additional impairment of goodwill 
interest income expense  net interest income  net decreased to  in the year ended january  from million in the year ended january  this decrease was primarily due to less funds available for investment and lower interest rates on our cash and cash equivalents and investments 
other income expense  net other income expense  net increased to  in the year ended january  from  in the year ended january   this increase was primarily due to foreign currency fluctuations and secondarily due to gains on sales of certain capital assets

the provision consists of income taxes payable in certain foreign locations  which cannot be offset through net operating loss carryforwards 
comparison of the fiscal years ended january  and revenue revenue increased million  or to million in the fiscal year ended january  from million in the fiscal year ended january  this increase was due primarily to the addition of revenue from smartforce s historical customer base 
to a lesser extent  this increase resulted from our new customers and increased revenue from our existing customers and a full year of revenues from books

the stock options granted at exercise prices below fair market value of the stock were granted by skillsoft corporation prior to its initial public offering and by books prior to it being acquired in december amortization of intangible assets increased to million in the fiscal year ended january  from  in the fiscal year ended january  the increase was primarily due to the intangible assets acquired in the merger and the books acquisition in december see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements

in response to several factors in the fourth quarter of fiscal and as part of our annual impairment test  we re evaluated the fair value of the goodwill established in connection with the merger and the books acquisition 
we prepared a cash flow analysis by reporting segment comparing the discounted cash flows to the net book values of the direct assets  goodwill and intangibles associated with the two reporting units multi modal learning and retail certification 
the discounted cash flows did not support the direct assets  goodwill and intangibles of the multi modal learning reporting unit 
however  the discounted cash flows did support the value of the retail certification reporting unit 
the enterprise value of the two reporting units and the identifiable intangible assets were based on valuations prepared by a third party appraisal firm using assumptions provided by management 
the enterprise value was based upon a discounted cash flow analysis prepared by our management 
the discounted cash flow analysis included many factors including a reduction in expected revenues for the fiscal year ended january  due to the elimination of three non core businesses telcom  prokoda services and custom global services and to a lesser extent  lower than anticipated revenues 
although market analysts continue to indicate strong growth in the e learning sector  we have assumed it to be a lower growth rate than originally considered at the time of the merger 
we have also valued our current customer base  including the synergies from cross selling our products  content  technology  trademarks and net operating loss carryforwards 
the cash flow analysis indicated the discounted cash flows were not sufficient to recover the assets 
accordingly  we have recorded a million impairment to goodwill in the fourth quarter of fiscal in connection with the merger  we decided to exit the telcom business and sold the business as of january  as more fully described in note c of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  other income expense includes the results of operations for the period from september  through january  of the telcom business

letters of credit are subject to commission fees of as well as administrative costs 
we have paid approximately  in letters of credit fees for the fiscal year ended january  we are in the process of negotiating certain terms of the line of credit with the bank in anticipation of the june  expiration of the existing line of credit 
as of january   we had us federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million  which are subject to potential limitations based upon change in control provisions of section of the internal revenue code  available to reduce future income taxes  if any 
we also had us federal tax credit carryforwards of approximately million at january  additionally  we had approximately million of net operating loss carryforwards in jurisdictions outside of the us if not utilized  these carryforwards expire at various dates through the year ending january  included in the million are approximately million of us net operating loss carryforwards and  of us tax credit carryforwards that were acquired in the merger and the purchase of books 
in addition  included in the million is approximately million of net operating loss carryforwards in jurisdictions outside the us acquired in the merger and the purchase of books 
we will realize the benefits of these acquired net operating losses through reductions to goodwill and non goodwill intangibles during the period that the losses are utilized 
at january   we have approximately million of net operating loss carryforwards in the united states resulting from disqualifying dispositions 
we will realize the benefit of these losses through increases to stockholder s equity in the periods in which the losses are utilized to reduce tax payments 
we lease certain of our facilities and certain equipment and furniture under operating lease agreements that expire at various dates through future minimum lease payments  net of estimated rentals  under these agreements are as follows in thousands payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations      purchase obligations total      we have entered into agreements to settle certain litigation matters  future minimum commitments under these agreements are as follows in thousands payments due by period less than litigation settlement commitments total year years netg   securities class action   securities class action    total    we expect to continue to experience growth in capital expenditures and operating expenses  particularly sales and marketing  in the fiscal year ending january  as compared to the fiscal year ended january  in order to execute our business plan and achieve expected revenue growth 
to the extent that our execution of the business plan results in increased sales  we expect to experience corresponding increases in deferred revenue  cash flow and prepaid expenses 
in addition  we are required to make litigation settlement payments totaling million 
we are in discussions with our insurers to determine how much  if any  of the settlement related to the securities class action lawsuits will be paid by them see item legal proceedings 
capital expenditures for the fiscal year ending january  are expected to be approximately million 
also  we expect to disburse approximately million throughout the fiscal year ending january  against exit and restructuring plan accruals recorded in the fiscal years ended january  and we expect that the principal sources of funding for our operating expenses  capital expenditures  litigation settlement payments and other liquidity needs will be a combination of our available cash and cash equivalents and short term investments which totaled approximately million as of january   our bank credit agreement and funds generated from operations 
we believe our current funds  available borrowings and expected cash flows from operating activities will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next months 
however  there are a number of factors that may negatively impact our available sources of funds 
in addition  our cash needs may increase due to factors such as unanticipated developments in our business or significant acquisitions 
the amount of cash generated from operations will be dependent upon the successful execution of our business plan and worldwide economic conditions 
although we do not foresee the need to raise additional capital  any unanticipated economic or business events could require us to raise additional capital to support operations

risks related to legal proceedings in connection with our restatement of the historical financial statements of smartforce  class action lawsuits have been filed against us and additional lawsuits may be filed  and we are the subject of a formal order of private investigation entered by the sec 
while preparing the closing balance sheet of smartforce as at september   the date on which we closed our merger with skillsoft corporation  certain accounting matters were identified relating to the historical financial statements of smartforce which  following the merger  are no longer our historical financial statements see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
on november   we announced our intent to restate the smartforce financial statements for   and the first two quarters of following this announcement  several lawsuits claiming to be class actions were commenced against us and certain of our current and former directors and officers  by or on behalf of persons claiming to be our shareholders and persons claiming to have purchased or otherwise acquired our securities at specified periods beginning as early as october  and continuing after september  these lawsuits have been consolidated 
on october   plaintiffs filed two amended complaints in the consolidated lawsuit  one on behalf of a purported class of purchasers of our adss between april  through november   and another on behalf of a purported class of skillsoft corporation shareholders who acquired our adss in connection with the merger 
in march  we reached a settlement of these class action lawsuits for total settlement payments to the plaintiffs of million 
the settlement is subject to court approval 
additional lawsuits may be filed against us 
we are the subject of a formal order of private investigation entered by the sec 
we are cooperating with the sec in connection with this investigation 
we will likely incur substantial costs in connection with the sec investigation  which could cause a diversion of management time and attention 
in addition  we could be subject to substantial penalties  fines or regulatory sanctions  which could adversely affect our business 
claims that we infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others could result in costly litigation or royalty payments to third parties  or require us to reengineer or cease sales of our products or services 
third parties have in the past and could in the future claim that our current or future products infringe their intellectual property rights 
any claim  with or without merit  could result in costly litigation or require us to reengineer or cease sales of our products or services  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
infringement claims could also result in an injunction in the use of our products or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to the combined company or at all 
from time to time we learn of parties that claim broad intellectual property rights in the e learning area that might implicate our offerings 
these parties or others could initiate actions against us in the future 
we could incur substantial costs resulting from product liability claims relating to our customers use of our products and services 
many of the business interactions supported by our products and services are critical to our customers businesses 
any failure in a customer s business interaction or other collaborative activity caused or allegedly caused in the future by our products and services could result in a claim for substantial damages against us  regardless of our responsibility for the failure 
although we maintain general liability insurance  including coverage for errors and omissions  there can be no assurance that existing coverage will continue to be available on reasonable terms or will be available in amounts sufficient to cover one or more large claims  or that the insurer will not disclaim coverage as to any future claim 
we could be subjected to legal actions based upon the content we obtain from third parties over whom we exert limited control 
it is possible that we could become subject to legal actions based upon claims that our course content infringes the rights of others or is erroneous 
any such claims  with or without merit  could subject us to costly litigation and the diversion of our financial resources and management personnel 
the risk of such claims is exacerbated by the fact that our course content is provided by third parties over whom we exert limited control 
further  if those claims are successful  we may be required to alter the content  pay financial damages or obtain content from others 
risks related to the merger between skillsoft corporation and smartforce we have identified significant deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls 
during the process of integrating the business processes  human resources  disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls of smartforce plc and skillsoft corporation following the merger  significant deficiencies in disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls were identified predominantly with respect to financial and regulatory compliance reporting at non us subsidiaries of the former smartforce plc and our ability to process the consolidated financial closing cycle 
our independent auditors have informed us that they believe we have these two reportable conditions in internal controls in certain of these areas 
these deficiencies have resulted in a significant strain to the internal resources and on the infrastructure of the finance organization and adversely impacted both the year end and quarter end financial closing processes 
while permanent resources and accounting process improvements have been and will continue to be added and implemented to improve the non us finance operations  the financial closing process and the overall internal control environment  additional changes to the disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls will be on going 
our independent auditors have informed us that they believe we have no material weaknesses at this time 
risks related to the operation of our business some of our international subsidiaries have not complied with regulatory requirements relating to their financial statements and tax returns 
we operate our business in various foreign countries through subsidiaries organized in those countries 
due to our restatement of the historical smartforce financial statements  some of our subsidiaries have not filed their audited statutory financial statements and have been delayed in filing their tax returns in their respective jurisdictions 
as a result  some of these foreign subsidiaries may be subject to regulatory restrictions  penalties and fines 
we and skillsoft corporation have experienced net losses in the past  and we may be unable to achieve or maintain profitability 
smartforce incurred substantial net losses both recently and in the past  including net losses of million in the six months ended june  skillsoft corporation incurred substantial net losses in every fiscal quarter prior to its fiscal quarter ended january  in addition  the combined company recorded a net loss of million for the fiscal year ended january  and million for the fiscal year ended january  we expect to incur significant expenses in connection with the completion of the migration to a unified platform and the continued expansion of this combined business  and  as a result  the business will need to generate significant revenues to achieve and maintain profitability 
we cannot guarantee whether our combined business will achieve or sustain profitability in any future period 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly 
this limits your ability to evaluate historical financial results and increases the likelihood that our results will fall below market analysts expectations  which could cause the price of our adss to drop rapidly and severely 
we have in the past experienced fluctuations in our quarterly operating results  and we anticipate that these fluctuations will continue 
as a result  we believe that our quarterly revenue  expenses and operating results are likely to vary significantly in the future 
if in some future quarters our results of operations are below the expectations of public market analysts and investors  this could have a severe adverse effect on the market price of our adss 
our operating results have historically fluctuated  and our operating results may in the future continue to fluctuate  as a result of factors  which include without limitation the size and timing of new renewal agreements and upgrades  royalty rates  the announcement  introduction and acceptance of new products  product enhancements and technologies by us and our competitors  the mix of sales between our field sales force  our other direct sales channels and our telesales channels  general conditions in the us or the international economy  the loss of significant customers  delays in availability of new products  product or service quality problems  seasonality due to the budget and purchasing cycles of our customers  we expect our revenue and operating results will generally be strongest in the second half of our fiscal year and weakest in the first half of our fiscal year  the spending patterns of our customers  litigation costs and expenses  including the costs related to the restatement of the smartforce financial statements  non recurring charges related to acquisitions  growing competition that may result in price reductions  and currency fluctuations 
most of our expenses  such as rent and most employee compensation  do not vary directly with revenue and are difficult to adjust in the short term 
as a result  if revenue for a particular quarter is below our expectations  we could not proportionately reduce operating expenses for that quarter 
any such revenue shortfall would  therefore  have a disproportionate effect on our expected operating results for that quarter 
demand for our products and services may be especially susceptible to adverse economic conditions 
our business and financial performance may be damaged by adverse financial conditions affecting our target customers or by a general weakening of the economy 
companies may not view training products and services as critical to the success of their businesses 
if these companies experience disappointing operating results  whether as a result of adverse economic conditions  competitive issues or other factors  they may decrease or forego education and training expenditures before limiting their other expenditures or in conjunction with lowering other expenses 
we rely on a limited number of third parties to provide us with educational content for our courses and referenceware  and our alliances with these third parties may be terminated or fail to meet our requirements 
we rely on a limited number of independent third parties to provide us with the educational content for a majority of our courses based on learning objectives and specific instructional design templates that we provide to them 
we do not have exclusive arrangements or long term contracts with any of these content providers 
if one or more of our third party content providers were to stop working with us  we would have to rely on other parties to develop our course content 
in addition  these providers may fail to develop new courses or existing courses on a timely basis 
we cannot predict whether new content or enhancements would be available from reliable alternative sources on reasonable terms 
in addition  books relies on third party publishers to provide all of the content incorporated into its referenceware products 
if one or more of these publishers were to terminate their license with us  we may not be able to find substitute publishers for such content 
in addition  we may be forced to pay increased royalties to these publishers to continue our licenses with them 
in the event that we are unable to maintain or expand our current development alliances or enter into new development alliances  our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
furthermore  we will be required to pay royalties to some of our development partners on products developed with them  which could reduce our gross margins 
we expect that cost of revenues may fluctuate from period to period in the future based upon many factors  including the revenue mix and the timing of expenses associated with development alliances 
in addition  the collaborative nature of the development process under these alliances may result in longer development times and less control over the timing of product introductions than for e learning offerings developed solely by us 
our strategic alliance partners may from time to time renegotiate the terms of their agreements with us  which could result in changes to the royalty or other arrangements  adversely affecting our results of operations 
the independent third party strategic partners we rely on for educational content and product marketing may compete with us  harming our results of operations 
our agreements with these third parties generally do not restrict them from developing courses on similar topics for our competitors or from competing directly with us 
as a result  our competitors may be able to duplicate some of our course content and gain a competitive advantage 
we rely on strategic alliances for marketing  which alliances are not exclusive  may be terminated or may fail to meet our requirements in the future 
we have developed strategic alliances to market many of our products 
however  these relationships are not exclusive  and our marketing partners could market other products in preference to  and in competition with  those developed by us 
in addition  we may be unable to continue to market future products through these alliances or may be unable to negotiate additional alliances in the future on acceptable terms  if at all 
the marketing efforts of our strategic partners may also disrupt our direct sales efforts 
our success depends on our ability to meet the needs of the rapidly changing market 
the market for education and training software is characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards  changes in customer requirements and preferences and frequent introductions of new products and services embodying new technologies 
new methods of providing interactive education in a technology based format are being developed and offered in the marketplace  including intranet and internet offerings 
in addition  multimedia and other product functionality features are being added to educational software 
our future success will depend upon the extent to which we are able to develop and implement products which address these emerging market requirements in a cost effective and timely basis 
product development is risky because it is difficult to foresee developments in technology  coordinate technical personnel and identify and eliminate design flaws 
any significant delay in releasing new products could have a material adverse effect on the ultimate success of our products and could reduce sales of predecessor products 
we may not be successful in introducing new products on a timely basis 
in addition  new products introduced by us may fail to achieve a significant degree of market acceptance or  once accepted  may fail to sustain viability in the market for any significant period 
if we are unsuccessful in addressing the changing needs of the marketplace due to resource  technological or other constraints  or in anticipating and responding adequately to changes in customers software technology and preferences  our business and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
the e learning market is a developing market  and our business will suffer if e learning is not widely accepted 
the market for e learning is a new and emerging market 
corporate training and education have historically been conducted primarily through classroom instruction and have traditionally been performed by a company s internal personnel 
many companies have invested heavily in their current training solutions 
although technology based training applications have been available for several years  they currently account for only a small portion of the overall training market 
accordingly  our future success will depend upon the extent to which companies adopt technology based solutions for their training activities  and the extent to which companies utilize the services or purchase products of third party providers 
many companies that have already invested substantial resources in traditional methods of corporate training may be reluctant to adopt a new strategy that may compete with their existing investments 
even if companies implement technology based training or e learning solutions  they may still choose to design  develop  deliver or manage all or part of their education and training internally 
if technology based learning does not become widespread  or if companies do not use the products and services of third parties to develop  deliver or manage their training needs  then our products and service may not achieve commercial success 
the success of our e learning strategy depends on the reliability and consistent performance of our information systems and internet infrastructure 
the success of our e learning strategy is highly dependent on the consistent performance of our information systems and internet infrastructure 
if our web site fails for any reason or if it experiences any unscheduled downtimes  even for only a short period  our business and reputation could be materially harmed 
we have in the past experienced performance problems and unscheduled downtime  and these problems could recur 
we currently rely on third parties for proper functioning of computer infrastructure  delivery of our e learning applications and the performance of our destination site 
our systems and operations could be damaged or interrupted by fire  flood  power loss  telecommunications failure  break ins  earthquake  financial patterns of hosting providers and similar events 
any system failures could adversely affect customer usage of our solutions and user traffic results in any future quarters  which could adversely affect our revenues and operating results and harm our reputation with corporate customers  subscribers and commerce partners 
accordingly  the satisfactory performance  reliability and availability of our web site and computer infrastructure is critical to our reputation and ability to attract and retain corporate customers  subscribers and commerce partners 
we cannot accurately project the rate or timing of any increases in traffic to our web site and  therefore  the integration and timing of any upgrades or enhancements required to facilitate any significant traffic increase to the web site are uncertain 
we have in the past experienced difficulties in upgrading our web site infrastructure to handle increased traffic  and these difficulties could recur 
the failure to expand and upgrade our web site or any system error  failure or extended down time could materially harm our business  reputation  financial condition or results of operations 
because many users of our e learning solutions will access them over the internet  factors adversely affecting the use of the internet or our customers networking infrastructures could harm our business 
many of our customer s users access our e learning solutions over the internet or through our customers internal networks 
any factors that adversely affect internet usage could disrupt the ability of those users to access our e learning solutions  which would adversely affect customer satisfaction and therefore our business 
for example  our ability to increase the effectiveness and scope of our services to customers is ultimately limited by the speed and reliability of both the internet and our customers internal networks 
consequently  the emergence and growth of the market for our products and services depends upon the improvements being made to the entire internet as well as to our individual customers networking infrastructures to alleviate overloading and congestion 
if these improvements are not made  and the quality of networks degrades  the ability of our customers to use our products and services will be hindered and our revenues may suffer 
additionally  a requirement for the continued growth of accessing e learning solutions over the internet is the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks 
failure to prevent security breaches into our products or our customers networks  or well publicized security breaches affecting the internet in general could significantly harm our growth and revenue 
advances in computer capabilities  new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments may result in a compromise of technology we use to protect content and transactions  our products or our customers proprietary information in our databases 
anyone who is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate proprietary and confidential information or could cause interruptions in our operations 
we may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against such security breaches or to address problems caused by security breaches 
the privacy of users may also deter people from using the internet to conduct transactions that involve transmitting confidential information 
our restructuring plans may be ineffective or may limit our ability to compete 
since the merger  we have recorded an aggregate of million in merger and exit costs and an aggregate of million of restructuring and other non recurring charges 
there are several risks inherent in these efforts to transition to a new cost structure 
these include the risk that we will not be successful in restoring profitability  and hence we may have to undertake further restructuring initiatives that would entail additional charges and create additional risks 
in addition  there is the risk that cost cutting initiatives will impair our ability to effectively develop and market products and remain competitive 
each of the above measures could have long term effects on our business by reducing our pool of talent  decreasing or slowing improvements in our products  making it more difficult for us to respond to customers  limiting our ability to increase production quickly if and when the demand for our products increases and limiting our ability to hire and retain key personnel 
these circumstances could cause our earnings to be lower than they otherwise might be 
we depend on a few key personnel to manage and operate the business and must be able to attract and retain highly qualified employees 
our success is largely dependent on the personal efforts and abilities of our senior management 
failure to retain these executives  or the loss of certain additional senior management personnel or other key employees  could have a material adverse effect on our business and future prospects 
we are also dependent on the continued service of our key sales  content development and operational personnel and on our ability to attract  train  motivate and retain highly qualified employees 
in addition  we depend on writers  programmers  web designers and graphic artists 
we may be unsuccessful in attracting  training  retaining or motivating key personnel 
in particular  the negative consequences including litigation of having to restate smartforce s historical financial statements  uncertainties surrounding the merger  and our recent adverse operating results and stock price performance could create uncertainties that materially and adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key personnel 
the inability to hire  train and retain qualified personnel or the loss of the services of key personnel could have a material adverse effect upon our business  new product development efforts and future business prospects 
changes in accounting standards regarding stock option plans could limit the desirability of granting stock options  which could harm our ability to attract and retain employees  and could also reduce our profitability 
the financial accounting standards board is considering whether to require all companies to treat the value of stock options granted to employees as an expense 
the united states congress and other governmental and regulatory authorities have also considered requiring companies to expense stock options 
if this change were to become mandatory  we and other companies would be required to record a compensation expense equal to the value of each stock option granted 
this expense would be spread over the vesting period of the stock option 
currently  we are generally not required to record compensation expenses in connection with stock option grants 
if we were required to expense stock option grants  it could reduce the attractiveness of granting stock options because the additional expense associated with these grants would reduce our profitability 
however  stock options are an important employee recruitment and retention tool  and we may not be able to attract and retain key personnel if we reduce the scope of our employee stock option program 
accordingly  in the event we are required to expense stock option grants  either our profitability  or our ability to use stock options as an employee recruitment and retention tool would be adversely impacted 
increased competition may result in decreased demand for our products and services  which may result in reduced revenues and gross profits and loss of market share 
the market for corporate education and training solutions is highly fragmented and competitive 
we expect the market to become increasingly competitive due to the lack of significant barriers to entry 
in addition to increased competition from new companies entering into the market  established companies are entering into the market through acquisitions of smaller companies  which directly compete with us  and this trend is expected to continue 
we may also face competition from publishing companies and vendors of application software  including those vendors with whom we have formed development and marketing alliances 
our primary sources of direct competition are third party suppliers of instructor led information technology  business  management and professional skills education and training  suppliers of computer based training and e learning solutions  internal education and training departments of potential customers  and value added resellers and network integrators 
growing competition may result in price reductions  reduced revenue and gross profits and loss of market share  any one of which would have a material adverse effect on our business 
many of our current and potential competitors have substantially greater financial  technical  sales  marketing and other resources  as well as greater name recognition  and we expect to face increasing price pressures from competitors as managers demand more value for their training budgets 
accordingly  we may be unable to provide e learning solutions that compare favorably with new instructor led techniques  other interactive training software or new e learning solutions 
our business is subject to currency fluctuations that could adversely affect our operating results 
due to our multinational operations  our operating results are subject to fluctuations based upon changes in the exchange rates between the currencies in which revenues are collected or expenses are paid 
in particular  the value of the us dollar against the euro and related currencies will impact our operating results 
our expenses will not necessarily be incurred in the currency in which revenue is generated  and  as a result  we will be required from time to time to convert currencies to meet our obligations 
these currency conversions are subject to exchange rate fluctuations  and changes to the value of the euro  pound sterling and other currencies relative to the us dollar could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
we may be unable to protect our proprietary rights 
unauthorized use of our intellectual property may result in development of products or services that compete with ours 
our success depends to a degree upon the protection of our rights in intellectual property 
we rely upon a combination of patent  copyright  and trademark laws to protect our proprietary rights 
we have also entered into  and will continue to enter into  confidentiality agreements with our employees  consultants and third parties to seek to limit and protect the distribution of confidential information 
however  we have not signed protective agreements in every case 
although we have taken steps to protect our proprietary rights  these steps may be inadequate 
existing patent  copyright  and trademark laws offer only limited protection 
moreover  the laws of other countries in which we market our products may afford little or no effective protection of our intellectual property 
additionally  unauthorized parties may copy aspects of our products  services or technology or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
other parties may also breach protective contracts we have executed or will in the future execute 
we may not become aware of  or have adequate remedies in the event of  a breach 
litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce or to determine the validity and scope of our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others 
even if we were to prevail  such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and technical resources 
our non us operations are subject to risks which could negatively impact our future operating results 
we expect that international operations will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues 
operations outside of the united states are subject to inherent risks  including difficulties or delays in developing and supporting non english language versions of our products and services  political and economic conditions in various jurisdictions  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign subsidiary operations  longer sales cycles and account receivable payment cycles  multiple  conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  protectionist laws and business practices that may favor local competitors  difficulties in finding and managing local resellers  potential adverse tax consequences  and the absence or significant lack of legal protection for intellectual property rights 
any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our future operations outside of the united states  which could negatively impact our future operating results 
the market price of our adss may fluctuate and may not be sustainable 
the market price of our adss has fluctuated significantly since our initial public offering and is likely to continue to be volatile 
in addition  in recent years the stock market in general  and the market for shares of technology stocks in particular  have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations  which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies 
the market price of our adss may continue to experience significant fluctuations in the future  including fluctuations that are unrelated to our performance 
as a result of these fluctuations in the price of our adss  it is difficult to predict what the price of our adss will be at any point in the future  and you may not be able to sell your adss at or above the price that you paid for them 
our sales cycle may make it difficult to predict our operating results 
the period between our initial contact with a potential customer and the purchase of our products not including smartcertify by that customer typically ranges from three to twelve months or more 
factors that contribute to our long sales cycle  include our need to educate potential customers about the benefits of our products  competitive evaluations by customers  the customers internal budgeting and approval processes  the fact that many customers view training products as discretionary spending  rather than purchases essential to their business  and the fact that we target large companies  which often take longer to make purchasing decisions due to the size and complexity of the enterprise 
these long sales cycles make it difficult to predict the quarter in which sales may occur 
delays in sales could cause significant variability in our revenues and operating results for any particular period 
our business could be adversely affected if our products contain errors 
software products as complex as ours contain known and undetected errors or bugs that result in product failures 
the existence of bugs could result in loss of or delay in revenues  loss of market share  diversion of product development resources  injury to reputation or damage to efforts to build brand awareness  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
the conviction of arthur andersen llp on obstruction of justice charges may adversely affect arthur andersen llp s ability to satisfy any claims arising from the provision of auditing services to skillsoft corporation and may impede our access to capital markets after the merger 
arthur andersen llp audited skillsoft corporation s financial statements for the fiscal years ended january   january  and january  on march   an indictment was unsealed charging it with federal obstruction of justice arising from the government s investigation of enron corp 
on june   arthur andersen llp was convicted of these charges 
it is possible that the effect of this conviction on arthur andersen llp s financial condition may adversely affect the ability of arthur andersen llp to satisfy any claims arising from its provision of auditing services to skillsoft corporation 
should we seek to access the public capital markets  sec rules will require us to include or incorporate by reference in any prospectus three years of audited financial statements 
the sec s current rules would require us to present audited financial statements for one or more fiscal years audited by arthur andersen llp and use reasonable efforts to obtain its consent until the audited financial statements for the fiscal year ending january  become available 
if prior to that time the sec ceases accepting financial statements audited by arthur andersen llp  it is possible that the available audited financial statements for the fiscal years ended january   january  and january  audited by arthur andersen llp might not satisfy the sec s requirements 
in that case  we would be unable to access the public capital markets unless ernst young llp  our current independent accounting firm  or another independent accounting firm  is able to audit the financial statements originally audited by arthur andersen llp 
any delay or inability to access the public capital markets caused by these circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business  profitability and growth prospects 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of january   we did not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
interest rate risk our general investing policy is to limit the risk of principal loss and to ensure the safety of invested funds by limiting market and credit risk 
we currently use a registered investment manager to place our investments in highly liquid money market accounts and government backed securities 
all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents 
interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates 
based on the short term nature of our investments  we have concluded that there is no significant market risk exposure 
foreign currency risk due to our multinational operations  our business is subject to fluctuations based upon changes in the exchange rates between the currencies in which we collect revenues or pay expenses and the us dollar 
our expenses are not necessarily incurred in the currency in which revenue is generated  and  as a result  we are required from time to time to convert currencies to meet our obligations 
these currency conversions are subject to exchange rate fluctuations  in particular changes to the value of the euro  canadian dollar  australian dollar  new zealand dollar  singapore dollar  and pound sterling relative to the us dollar  which could adversely affect our business and the results of operations
