this transaction has been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and accordingly  the operating results of lci have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the effective date of the acquisition

we expect to realize annualized cost savings of approximately million 
our integration activities in will also address lci s product lines  including efforts to de emphasize lower volume and lower margin product lines 
sales 
our sales are primarily derived from the sale of collectibles and toys and are recognized upon transfer of title of product to our customers 
we market our products through a variety of distribution channels including chain retailers  specialty and hobby wholesalers and retailers  oem dealers  corporate promotional accounts and direct to consumers 
for the years ended december   and  sales to chain retailers comprised  and  respectively  of our net sales 
our products are marketed and distributed in north america  europe  australia and asia pacific 
international sales including canada and mexico constituted of our net sales in and and of our net sales in we expect international sales to increase over the next several years as we expand our geographic reach 
our net sales have not been materially impacted by foreign currency fluctuations 
we derive a significant portion of our sales from some of the world s largest retailers and oem dealers 
our top five customers accounted for   and of our net sales in  and  respectively 
wal mart  our largest customer  accounted for  and of total net sales in  and  respectively 
the john deere dealer network accounted for and of total net sales in and  respectively 
other than wal mart and the john deere dealer network  no customer accounted for more than of our total net sales in and in  other than wal mart  no customer accounted for more than of our total net sales 
we provide certain customers the option to take delivery of our products either in the united states  united kingdom  australia  canada or germany with credit terms ranging from to days or directly in china with payment made by irrevocable letter of credit or wire transfer 
we generally grant price discounts of to on direct sales from china resulting in lower gross margins 
however  shipments direct from china lower our distribution and administrative costs  so we believe that our operating income margin is comparable for products delivered in china versus products shipped in the united states  united kingdom  australia  canada or germany 
for the years ended december   and  direct sales from china constituted  and  respectively  of our net sales 
we do not ordinarily sell our products on consignment  and we ordinarily accept returns only for defective merchandise

expenses 
our products are manufactured by third parties  principally located in china 
cost of sales primarily consists of purchases of finished products  which accounted for  and of our cost of sales in  and  respectively 
the remainder of our cost of sales primarily includes tooling depreciation  freight in from suppliers and concept and design expenses 
substantially all of our purchases of finished products from the far east are denominated in hong kong dollars  and therefore  subject to currency fluctuations 
historically  we have not incurred substantial exposure due to currency fluctuations because the hong kong government has maintained a policy of linking the hong kong dollar and us dollar since a fut ure increase in the value of the hong kong dollar relative to the us dollar may increase our cost of sales and decrease our gross margins 
additionally  if our suppliers experience increased raw materials  labor or other costs and pass along such cost increases to us through higher prices for finished goods  our cost of sales would increase and  to the extent we are unable to pass such price increases along to our customers  our gross margins would decrease 
our quarterly gross margins can also be affected by the mix of product that is shipped during each quarter 
while overall  all of our product categories approximate a similar gross margin  individual product lines within a category can carry gross margins that vary significantly and cause quarterly fluctuations  based on the timing of these individual shipments throughout the year 
however  the gross margin on an annual basis generally is more stable  historically falling within the general range of to

thirty million dollars of the term loan has an interest rate of plus applicable margin through the maturity of the agreement 
the remaining term loan and revolving loan bear interest  at the company s option  at the base rate or at a libor rate plus applicable margin

the following table summarizes our significant contractual commitments at december  in thousands payment due by period contractual obligations total and beyond long term debt including current portion operating leases minimum royalty guarantees total contractual cash obligations we believe that our cash flows from operations  cash on hand and available borrowings will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements and provide us with adequate liquidity to meet anticipated operating needs in working capital financing requirements are usually highest during the third and fourth quarters due to seasonal increases in demand for our collectibles and toys

the company s management reviews for indicators that might suggest an impairment loss could exist 
testing for impairment requires estimates of expected cash flows to be generated from the use of the assets 
various uncertainties  including changes in consumer preferences  deterioration in the political environment or changes in general economic conditions  could impact the expected cash flows to be generated by an asset or group of assets

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk is limited to interest rate risk associated with our credit agreement and foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with our foreign operations 
the company s previous credit agreement required that the company maintain an interest rate protection agreement 
effective june   the company entered into an interest rate collar transaction covering million of its debt  with a cap based on day libor rates of and a floor of 
the agreement  which had quarterly settlement dates  expired on june  for the years ended december  and  the company paid approximately  and  respectively  which is included in interest expense on the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings 
additionally  a charge of approximately  and a benefit of approximately  were recorded in net interest expense related to the change in fair value of the company s interest rate collar during the years ended december  and  respectively 
based on the company s interest rate exposure on variable rate borrowings at december   a one percentage point increase in average interest rates on the company s borrowings would increase future interest expense by approximately  per month and a five percentage point increase would increase future interest expense by approximately  per month 
the company determined these amounts based on approximately million of variable rate borrowings at december  multiplied by and  respectively  and divided by since the expiration of the collar transaction described in the preceding paragraph  the company has not used any interest rate collars  hedges or other derivative financial instruments to manage or reduce interest rate risk 
as a result  any increase in interest rates on the company s variable rate borrowings would increase interest expense and reduce net income 
the company s net sales are primarily denominated in us dollars  except for a small amount of net sales denominated in uk pounds  australian dollars  euros and canadian dollars 
the company s purchases of finished goods from chinese manufacturers are primarily denominated in hong kong dollars 
expenses for these manufacturers are primarily denominated in chinese renminbi 
the hong kong dollar and the chinese renminbi are currently pegged to the us dollar 
if the hong kong dollar or the chinese renminbi ceased to be pegged to the us dollar  a material increase in the value of the hong kong dollar or the chinese renminbi relative to the us dollar or the uk pound would increase our expenses and therefore could adversely affect our profitability 
a change in the exchange rate of the us dollar with respect to the hong kong dollar for the year ended december  would have changed the tot al dollar amount of our gross profit by approximately 
a change in the exchange rate of the us dollar with respect to the uk pound  the australian dollar  the euro or the canadian dollar for the year ended december  would not have had a significant impact on the company s earnings 
the company is also subject to exchange rate risk relating to transfers of funds denominated in uk pounds  australian dollars  canadian dollars or euros from its foreign subsidiaries to the united states 
historically  the company has not used any hedges or other derivative financial instruments to manage or reduce exchange rate risk
