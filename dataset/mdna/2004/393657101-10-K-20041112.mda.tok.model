item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary greenbrier currently operates in two primary business segments manufacturing and leasing services 
from operations in the united states  canada  mexico and europe  the manufacturing segment produces double stack intermodal railcars  conventional railcars  tank cars  marine vessels and performs railcar repair  refurbishment and maintenance activities 
the company may also manufacture new freight cars through the use of unaffiliated subcontractors 
the leasing services segment owns approximately  railcars and provides management services for approximately  railcars for railroads  shippers  carriers and other leasing and transportation companies 
the two business segments are operationally integrated 
segment performance is evaluated based on margin 
in  the company benefited from the continued economic recovery and growth in demand for railroad freight cars 
improvements in the north american economy have created increased rail traffic  which combined with the aging of the industry s railcar fleet  has resulted in an increased demand for railcars 
north american industry railcar orders for the first three quarters of calendar year were  cars  compared to  cars in the entire calendar year and  cars in the entire calendar year greenbrier was able to obtain of these orders for the first three quarters of calendar  and and of all new orders in calendar years and north american industry backlog at september  was  cars  the highest level since greenbrier has approximately of this backlog  which exceeds the company s estimated industry capacity of 
prices for steel  the primary component of railcars and barges  have risen sharply this year and remain volatile as a result of increased costs of raw materials  strong demand  limited availability of scrap metal for steel processing and reduced capacity 
availability of scrap metal has been further limited by exports to china 
as a result  steel providers are charging scrap surcharges 
in addition  the price and availability of other railcar components  which are a product of steel  have been adversely affected by the steel issues 
a portion of the sales agreements for railcars in backlog are fixed price contracts which do not contain escalation clauses in the event of increased prices for steel or other component parts 
greenbrier has initiated a plan to aggressively manage steel and scrap surcharge issues with customers and suppliers through negotiation and pass through of costs where possible 
increases in prices  surcharges or availability of raw materials may impact the company s margins and production schedules in future periods 
the available supply of rail castings to the industry has been adversely affected during the past two years as a result of the reorganization and consolidation of domestic suppliers 
during  in an effort to minimize castings supply shortages  the company acquired a minority ownership interest in a joint venture  accounted for under the equity method  which leases and operates a foundry in cicero  illinois to produce castings for freight cars 
this joint venture also acquired a foundry in alliance  ohio which began casting production in january the supply of castings from these two facilities has helped the company maintain levels of production despite industry wide castings shortages 
in august  the company s board of directors committed to a plan to recapitalize european operations which consist of a railcar manufacturing plant in swidnica  poland and a railcar sales  design and engineering operation in siegen  germany 
following discussions with various potential investors  the company signed a letter of intent with a private equity group which was subject to certain contingencies and final negotiations 
during the second quarter of  greenbrier discontinued discussions with the group  as the final negotiations proved unsatisfactory 
as a result  greenbrier has retained the european operations and the related financial results have been reclassified from discontinued operations to continuing operations for all periods presented 
results of operations overview total revenue was million  million and million for the years ended august   and earnings for and were million or per diluted common share and million or per diluted common share 
net loss for was million or per diluted common share 

table of contents manufacturing segment manufacturing revenue includes new railcar  marine  refurbishment and maintenance activities 
new railcar delivery and backlog information disclosed herein includes all facilities  including subcontracted production and the mexico joint venture that is accounted for by the equity method 
manufacturing revenue was million  million and million for the years ended  and railcar deliveries  which are the primary source of manufacturing revenue  were approximately  units in compared to  units in and  units in deliveries in  and include approximately  and units delivered from the mexican joint venture accounted for under the equity method 
current year deliveries also include units produced in the prior year for which revenue recognition had been deferred pending removal of contractual contingencies that were removed in manufacturing revenue increased million  or  in from principally due to increased new railcar deliveries offset by units with a lower average sales value 
deliveries in consisted of intermodal railcars and conventional railcars compared to intermodal railcars and conventional railcars in intermodal railcars generally have selling prices that average to of that of conventional railcars 
manufacturing revenue increased million  or  in from due to increased deliveries in response to improvements in the demand for railcars  obtaining certification on certain railcars which were produced in a prior period  slightly offset by a product mix with a lower average unit sales value 
as of august   the company s backlog of new railcars to be manufactured for sale and lease was approximately  railcars with an estimated value of million 
even with increasing production and deliveries  backlog has increased significantly over the prior year as the railcar market continues to recover 
backlog as of august  was  railcars with a value of million 
manufacturing margin increased to in from in due to efficiencies associated with higher volumes and long production runs and an improved pricing environment  offset partially by steel price increases and steel scrap surcharges 
the primary factors for the increase in margin from in to in were efficiencies associated with higher production rates  a favorable shift in product mix and lower depreciation and amortization  offset somewhat by costs related to production delays associated with a patent litigation 
the factors influencing cost of revenue and gross margin in a given period include order size which affects economies of plant utilization  production rates  product mix  changes in manufacturing costs  product pricing and currency exchange rates 
leasing services segment leasing services revenue was million  million and million for the years ended  and the increase in revenue in from was primarily the result of margin realized on the sale of new railcars produced by an unconsolidated subsidiary  growth of the operating lease portfolio  increased utilization of the lease fleet and reductions in rental assistance guarantees  offset partially by the effects of the maturation of the direct finance lease portfolio 
the decrease in leasing services revenue from to is due to a number of factors including maturation of the direct finance lease portfolio  increased pressure on lease renewal rates and a reduction of gains on sale of equipment from the lease fleet  offset partially by reductions of accruals for rental assistance guarantees and increased utilization of the car hire lease fleet 
pre tax earnings realized on the disposition of leased equipment amounted to million during compared to million in and million in assets from greenbrier s lease fleet are periodically sold in the normal course of business in order to take advantage of market conditions  manage risk and maintain liquidity 
approximately one third of the owned equipment in the lease fleet was acquired through an agreement with union pacific  which contains a fixed price purchase option exercisable upon lease expiration 
union pacific has notified greenbrier of their intention to exercise this option on all remaining railcars in this program 
as these leases mature over the next three years  related leasing revenue will continue to decline 
revenue may be replaced by growth of the lease fleet and management services 
approximately one third of leasing services revenue is derived from car hire which is a fee that a railroad pays for the use of railcars owned by other railroads or third parties 
there is some risk that car hire rates could be negotiated or arbitrated to lower levels in the future 
this could reduce future car hire revenue 
car hire revenue amounted to million  million and million in  and 
table of contents leasing services margin  as a percentage of revenue  was in compared to in both and margins have increased in as a result of margins realized on the sale of railcars produced by an unconsolidated subsidiary  increased utilization of the owned lease fleet  growth of the operating lease fleet with leases that are higher margin than maturing direct finance leases and reductions in rental assistance guarantee costs 
other costs selling and administrative expense was million  million and million in  and the million increase from to is primarily the result of consulting associated with strategic initiatives  compliance with sarbanes oxley legislation  increases in incentive compensation associated with improved financial results and other employee costs 
the million increase from to is primarily the result of professional fees associated with strategic initiatives and litigation  partially offset by reduction of amortization as a result of the revaluation to fair market value of certain assets in europe 
selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue in was compared to in and in the declining ratio is primarily due to continued efforts to control costs and increasing revenues 
interest and foreign exchange was million  million and million in  and decreases were primarily the result of lower outstanding debt balances due to scheduled repayments of debt 
special charges of million were incurred in these charges consist of a million write off of the remaining balance of european designs and patents partially offset by a million reduction of purchase price liabilities associated with the settlement of arbitration on the acquisition of european designs and patents 
pre tax special charges of million were incurred during these costs included million for severance costs associated with north american operations and legal and professional fees  million associated with a restructuring plan to decrease operating expenses  consolidate offices and reduce the scale of european operations  a million impairment write down of european railcar designs and patents and million for various european asset write downs to fair market value 
income tax expense or benefit for all periods presented represents a statutory tax rate of on united states operations and varying effective tax rates on foreign operations 
the effective tax rate was  and for  and the fluctuations in effective tax rates are due to the geographical mix of pre tax earnings and losses 
the polish operations generated loss carry forwards in prior periods that were utilized to offset current year earnings in poland 
no tax benefit was recognized in prior periods for these losses 
in addition  special charges in include a million non taxable purchase price adjustment relating to the purchase of european designs and patents 
equity in loss of unconsolidated subsidiaries increased million from to this is a result of startup costs and temporary plant shutdowns associated with equipment issues at the castings joint venture that began production in  partially offset by improved operating results from the mexican railcar manufacturing joint venture due to higher production levels as the plant was operating for the entire year 
equity in loss of unconsolidated subsidiaries decreased million for as compared to as a result of higher production levels and favorable exchange rates at the mexican railcar manufacturing joint venture 
the plant resumed deliveries in may after a shutdown that began in january liquidity and capital resources greenbrier has been financed through cash generated from operations and borrowings 
at august   cash decreased million to million from million at the prior year end 
the million decrease was due to million used in operating activities  million used in investing activities and million used in financing activities 
cash used in operations for the year ended august   was million compared to cash provided by operations of million in and million in the increase in usage from to is primarily due to a million participation payment in accordance with the defined payment schedule under an agreement with union pacific  increases in inventory and accounts receivable  offset partially by increases in accounts payable 
inventory increases resulted from higher production levels  certification issues on certain cars in europe  two barges in process that are accounted for under the completed contract method and railcars that will be sold to third party customers in the normal course of business 
increases in the accounts receivable balances are due to increases in production levels  varying customer payment terms and a million receivable from an unconsolidated subsidiary for inventory purchases 
increases in accounts payable balances are associated with inventory purchases to support increased production levels and for purchases made in august for an unconsolidated subsidiary to take advantage of centralized purchasing opportunities 

table of contents cash used in investing activities for the year ended august  of million compared to cash provided by investing activities of million in and million in the increased usage in was primarily the result of million in purchases of railcars for the lease fleet to replace the maturing direct finance lease portfolio compared to purchases of million and million in and cash used for lease fleet additions was offset by proceeds from equipment sales of million in and million in both and and reduced principal payments received on finance leases due to the maturation of the portfolio 
cash used in financing activities of million for the year ended august compared to million in the same period in and million for the reduction was primarily due to lower scheduled repayments of borrowings as million in term debt and subordinated debt was repaid in compared to million in and million in all amounts originating in foreign currency have been translated at the august  exchange rate for the following discussion 
credit facilities aggregated million as of august  available borrowings under the credit facilities are principally based upon defined levels of receivables  inventory and leased equipment  which at august  levels would provide for maximum borrowing of million 
a million revolving line of credit is available through january to provide working capital and interim financing of equipment for the leasing services operations 
a million line of credit to be used for working capital is available through march for united states manufacturing operations 
a million line of credit is available through october for working capital for canadian manufacturing operations 
lines of credit totaling million are available principally through june for working capital for european manufacturing operations 
advances under the lines of credit bear interest at rates that vary depending on the type of borrowing and certain defined ratios 
at august   there were no borrowings outstanding under the united states manufacturing  canadian manufacturing and leasing services lines 
outstanding borrowings under the european manufacturing line were million 
in accordance with customary business practices in europe  the company has million in bank and third party performance  advance payment and warranty guarantee facilities  of which million has been utilized as of august  to date no amounts have been drawn under these performance  advance payment and warranty guarantee facilities 
in  an agreement was entered into for the purchase  refurbishment and lease of over  used railcars between and the agreement provides that  under certain conditions  the seller will receive a percentage of defined earnings of a subsidiary  and further defines the period when such payments are to be made 
such amounts  referred to as participation  are accrued when earned  charged to leasing services cost of revenue  and unpaid amounts are included as participation in the consolidated balance sheets 
participation expense was million  million and million in  and payment of participation was million in and is estimated to be million in  million in  million in  million in and million in and million thereafter 
the company has entered into contingent rental assistance agreements  aggregating a maximum of million  on certain railcars subject to leases that have been sold to third parties 
these agreements guarantee the purchasers a minimum lease rental  subject to a maximum defined rental assistance amount  over remaining periods that range from one to eight years 
a liability is established and revenue is reduced in the period during which a determination can be made that it is probable that a rental shortfall will occur and the amount can be estimated 
for the year ended august  no accruals were made to cover estimated future obligations  as the remaining liability of million was believed to be adequate 
for the years ended august  and  million and million was accrued 

table of contents the company has advanced million in long term advances to unconsolidated subsidiaries for working capital needs 
the advances are secured by accounts receivable and inventory 
the company has also guaranteed million in third party debt for an unconsolidated subsidiary

approximately million  million and million of capital expenditures for  and were attributable to manufacturing operations 
capital expenditures for manufacturing are expected to be approximately million in foreign operations give rise to risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
greenbrier utilizes foreign currency forward exchange contracts with established financial institutions to hedge a portion of that risk 
no provision has been made for credit loss due to counterparty non performance 
a dividend of 
per share was declared and paid in the fourth quarter of no dividends were paid during  consistent with the company s policy to manage cash flow and liquidity during the downturn in the railcar industry 
a dividend of 
per share was declared in the first quarter and paid in the second quarter of future dividends are dependent upon the market outlook as well as earnings  capital requirements and financial condition of the company 
certain loan covenants restrict the transfer of funds from subsidiaries to the parent company in the form of cash dividends  loans or advances 
the restricted net assets of subsidiaries amounted to million as of august  consolidated retained earnings of million at august  were restricted as to the payment of dividends 
management expects existing funds and cash generated from operations  together with borrowings under existing credit facilities and long term financing  to be sufficient to fund dividends  if any  working capital needs  planned capital expenditures and scheduled debt repayments for the foreseeable future 
the following table shows the company s estimated future contractual cash obligations as of august  year ending in thousands total thereafter notes payable participation railcar operating leases other operating leases revolving notes purchase commitments 
table of contents off balance sheet arrangements the company does not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are likely to have a material current or future effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires judgment on the part of management to arrive at estimates and assumptions on matters that are inherently uncertain 
these estimates may affect the amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses reported in a given period 
estimates and assumptions are periodically evaluated and may be adjusted in future periods 
impairment of long lived assets when changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of certain long lived assets may not be recoverable  the assets will be evaluated for impairment 
if the forecast undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the assets  an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the assets to fair value will be recognized 
income taxes for financial reporting purposes  income tax expense is estimated based on planned income tax return filings 
the amounts anticipated to be reported in those filings may change between the time the financial statements are prepared and the time the tax returns are filed 
further  because tax filings are subject to review by taxing authorities  there is also the risk that a position taken in preparing a tax return may be challenged by a taxing authority 
if the taxing authority is successful in asserting their position  differences in tax expense or between current and deferred tax items may arise in future periods 
such differences  which could have a material impact on greenbrier s financial statements  would be reflected in the financial statements when management considers them probable of occurring and the amount reasonably estimable 
valuation allowances reduce deferred assets to an amount that will more likely than not be realized 
management s estimates of the company s ability to realize deferred tax assets is based on the information available at the time the financial statements are prepared and may include estimates of future income and other assumptions that are inherently uncertain 
maintenance obligations the company is responsible for maintenance on a portion of the managed and owned lease fleet under the terms of maintenance obligations defined in the underlying lease or management agreement 
the estimated liability is based on maintenance histories for each type and age of car 
the liability is periodically reviewed and updated based on maintenance trends and known future repair or refurbishment requirements 
warranty accruals warranty accruals are estimated and charged to operations to cover a defined warranty period 
the estimated warranty cost is based on historical warranty claims for each particular product type 
for new product types without a warranty history  preliminary estimates are based on historical information for similar product types 
the warranty accrual is periodically reviewed and updated based on warranty trends 
contingent rental assistance the company has entered into contingent rental assistance agreements on certain railcars  subject to leases  that have been sold to third parties 
these agreements guarantee the purchasers a minimum lease rental  subject to a maximum defined rental assistance amount  over remaining periods that range from one to eight years 
a liability is established when management believes that it is probable that a rental shortfall will occur and the amount can be estimated 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
railcars are generally manufactured  repaired or refurbished under firm orders from third parties  and revenue is recognized when the cars are completed  accepted by an unaffiliated customer and contractual contingencies removed 
greenbrier may also manufacture railcars prior to receipt of firm orders  build railcars under lease which are then sold to a third party leasing company and may also build railcars for its own lease fleet 
railcars produced in a given period may be delivered in subsequent periods  delaying revenue recognition 
revenue does not include sales of new railcars to  or refurbishment services performed for  the leasing services segment since intercompany transactions are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements 
the margin generated from such sales or refurbishment activity is realized by the leasing services segment over the related life of the asset or upon sale of the equipment to a third party 

table of contents marine revenues are either recognized on the percentage of completion method during the construction period or completed contract method based on the terms of the contract 
direct finance lease revenue is recognized over the lease term in a manner that produces a constant rate of return on the net investment in the lease 
operating lease revenue is recognized as earned under the lease terms 
certain leases are operated under car hire arrangements whereby revenue is earned based on utilization  car hire rates and terms specified in the lease agreement 
car hire revenue is reported from a third party source two months in arrears  however  such revenue is accrued in the month earned based on estimates of use from historical activity and is adjusted to actual as reported 
such adjustments have historically not been significantly different from the estimates 
initial adoption of accounting policies statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity  was adopted as of september  the statement establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity and generally requires an entity to classify a financial instrument that falls within this scope as a liability 
other than the change in description of a preferred stock interest in a subsidiary that had been previously described as minority interest to subsidiary shares subject to mandatory redemption  the adoption of sfas no 
had no effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  as amended by fin r was adopted during the third quarter of fin requires consolidation where there is a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity  previously referred to as a special purpose entity and certain other entities 
the adoption of fin r had no effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk greenbrier has operations in canada  mexico  germany and poland that conduct business in their local currencies as well as other regional currencies 
to mitigate its exposure to transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of each entity  the company enters into forward exchange contracts to protect the margin on a portion of forecast foreign currency sales 
at august   the company has entered into million of forward exchange contracts 
because of the variety of currencies in which purchases and sales are transacted  it is not possible to predict the impact of a movement in foreign currency exchange rates on future operating results 
in addition to exposure to transaction gains or losses  the company is also exposed to foreign currency exchange risk related to the net asset position of foreign subsidiaries 
at august   the net assets of foreign subsidiaries aggregated million and a uniform strengthening of the united states dollar relative to the foreign currencies would result in a decrease in stockholders equity of million  or of total stockholders equity 
this calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the united states dollar 
interest rate risk the company has managed its floating rate debt with interest rate swap agreements  effectively converting million of variable rate debt to fixed rate debt 
at august   the exposure to interest rate risk is limited since approximately of the company s debt has fixed interest rates 
as a result  greenbrier is only exposed to interest rate risk relating to its revolving debt and a small portion of term debt 
at august   a uniform increase in interest rates would result in approximately million of additional annual interest expense
