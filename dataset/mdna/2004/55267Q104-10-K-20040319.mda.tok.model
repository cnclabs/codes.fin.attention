item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the selected consolidated financial data set forth above and the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
overview revenues and expenses since its founding  the company has been engaged in the business of investing in  owning and operating second hand vessels 
as of december   the company s fleet included seven liquid petroleum gas lpg carriers  four containerships and two multipurpose seariver vessels 
each of the company s vessels is owned by a separate wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
the company generally employs its vessels on time charter  bareboat charter or spot charter 
with time charters  the company receives a fixed charterhire per on hire day and is responsible for meeting all the operating expenses of the vessels  such as crew costs  voyage expenses  insurance  repairs and maintenance 
in the case of bareboat charters  the company receives a fixed charterhire per day for the vessel and the charterer is responsible for all the costs associated with the vessel s operation during the bareboat charter period 
in the case of voyage charters  the vessel is contracted only for a voyage between two ports the company is paid for the cargo transported and pays all voyage costs 
in all chartering arrangements  both shipowner and charterer will generally employ the services of one or more brokers  who are paid a commission on the total value of the daily charterhire or a lump sum payable under the charterparty or contract 
the level of the company s revenues and expenses will vary from year to year depending on  inter alia  the number of vessels controlled by the company during each year 
shipping markets during  the market for small lpg carriers remained weak  while the large lpg vessels were able to fare somewhat better 
the lpg market demonstrated slightly greater strength towards the very end of the year management feels that increased import requirements in the far east and the lack of new building orders for lpg carriers will help this trend to continue into management is therefore cautiously optimistic for the year to come 
the company owns six small lpg carriers of the fully pressurised type 
in addition  the company owns a very large lpg carrier  which is fixed on a long term charter ending in september during that same period  the market for containerships enjoyed strong growth  buoyed by dynamism in chinese trade  and the slowdown of new vessel deliveries 
the company is not taking advantage of this strong market  since its four container vessels are on fixed charters until september to maersk sealand 
accumulated deficit 
as of december   the company s accumulated deficit was  this amount consisted of total accumulated losses net of accumulated profits of  since the company s inception and dividends declared of  over the same period 
an additional  of dividends were paid and accounted for as a reduction of paid in capital over the same period 
the majority of such dividends were paid prior to when the company was a self liquidating fund with a dividend policy based on cash flow generation 
results of operations for the years ended december  and december  significant events during in february  the company repurchased notes having a total face value of  and recorded a gain of  on the transaction 
in july  the company sold four second hand container vessels to a non related third party for a total sale price of  and recorded a gain of  revenue the company had gross revenue from charterhire and other sources of  for the year ended december   a decrease from gross revenue of  in the revenue decrease resulted mainly from the sale of four vessels in july and the fact that days of hire were lost in as eight vessels underwent dry docking 
vessels on time charter the average rate per day on hire computed as total revenues divided by total number of days on hire for the vessels on time charter was  in  in 
the reduction is mainly due to the reduction in charterhire of the four remaining containerships in october in  the company s on hire performance of the vessels on time charter was on a potential  days on a potential  days in 
the decrease in on hire performance was mainly due to the large number of dry docks in in  the vessels on time charter experienced off hire time for the following reasons i of the total available days were lost due to technical reasons operating off hire  ii of the total available days were lost due to dry docking and planned repair time  and iii of the total available days represented time spent in positioning for subsequent employment 
vessels on bareboat charter the average rate per day on hire for the vessels on bareboat charter was  per day in 
bareboat charter rates are generally lower than time charter rates since the vessel operating expenses are paid by the charterer see item business general 
the on hire performance was 
the vessels on bareboat charter were sold in july costs and expenses commission on charterhire was  in  an decrease from the  incurred during this decrease is a direct result of decreased revenues 
vessel operating expenses plus amortisation of dry docking costs totalled  for the year ended december   representing a decrease of from vessel operating expenses plus amortisation of dry docking which amounted to  vessel operating expenses comprise vessel running costs  direct costs such as fuel costs  port charges and canal dues incurred directly while vessels are unemployed or are employed on voyage charters and management fees 
as a percentage of revenue  vessel operating expenses plus amortisation of dry docking costs were equal to in compared to in the increase in vessel operating expenses as a percentage of revenues in is due to the sale of vessels operated on a bareboat basis which do not have any operating expenses see item overview 
depreciation was  for the year ended december   compared to  in the decrease resulted from the reduced fleet size 
general and administrative expenses were  for the year ended december   compared to  in this represented of revenue in as compared to of revenue in the increase in percentage is due to the fact that these expenses are rather stable and revenues were down 
other income and expenses interest expense amounted to  for the year ended december  as compared to  in  and represented of revenue as compared with in the decrease in interest expense resulted from a reduction in interest expense on the notes due to the repurchases and to lower interest rates in on the company s existing credit facility with fortis bank and banque nationale de paris bnp 
interest income totalled  in  a decrease from interest income of  in the decrease in interest earnings was due to the reduction in the general level of interest rates and lower cash balances 
in  the company repurchased notes having a total face value of  and recorded a gain of  on the transaction 
in  the company repurchased notes having a total face value of  and recorded a gain of  on the transactions 
the repurchased notes have been retired 
the company recognised a  gain on the sale of four container vessels in july impairment loss in  a provision for estimated impairment loss of  was recorded as the values of two vessels earmarked for sale in december were adjusted to market value 
these vessels were reclassified from held for sale to held and used at the end of they were reinstated at the carrying amount  before they were classified as held for sale  adjusted for any depreciation expense that would have been recognised had the vessels been continuously classified as held and used  which amount was lower than fair value at year end 
in march  the board approved the sale of two other vessels 
the vessels were written down to the lower of book value or fair market value less costs to sell 
since these vessels could not be sold  they were reclassified from held for sale to held and used at the end of the provision for estimated impairment loss recorded in was  as of december   the company had no vessels earmarked for sale 
in january  the company received appraisals for its fleet from leading independent shipbrokers 
the appraised value of the company s fleet was approximately million 
this indicated that the aggregate market value of the vessels was approximately equal to the carrying values 
the aggregate market value of the container carriers were approximately million above their carrying values while the aggregate market value of the gas carriers were million below their carrying values 
the company s estimates of undiscounted cash flows indicated at that time that such carrying values were expected to be recovered 
evaluating recoverability requires management to make estimates and assumptions regarding future cash flows see critical accounting estimates 
actual results could differ from those estimates  which could have a material effect on the recoverability of vessels 
management regularly obtains valuations of its vessels and will continue to monitor such valuations in order to determine if any permanent impairment in asset values occurs  and whether any write downs in asset values are necessary 
net income the net income for the year ended december  was  as compared to a net income of  for the year ended december  impact of inflation management believes that inflation did not have a material impact upon the company s business during the year ended december  subsequent events in march  the company repurchased notes having a total face value of  and recorded a net gain of  on the transactions 
the repurchased notes will be retired 
results of operations for the years ended december  and december  significant events during in april  the company purchased four second hand container vessels from a non affiliated third party  each with a two and a half year bareboat charter back

actual results could differ from those estimates  which could have a mate rial effect on the recoverability of vessels 
management regularly obtains valuations of its vessels and will continue to monitor such valuations in order to determine if any permanent impairment in asset values occurs  and whether any write downs in asset values are necessary 
net income the net income for the year ended december  was  as compared to a net income of  for the year ended december  impact of inflation management believes that inflation did not have a material impact upon the company s business during the year ended december  critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the company s financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires that management make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the following is a discussion of the accounting policies applied by the company that are considered to involve a higher degree of judgment in their application 
in accordance with sfas accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the company s long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
in evaluating the carrying values of long lived assets  management reviews valuations performed by leading independent shipbrokers and compares these to the vessels carrying values 
an impairment loss for an asset held for use is recognized  when the estimate of undiscounted cash flows  excluding interest charges  expected to be generated by the use of the asset is less than its carrying amount 
measurement of the impairment loss is based on the fair value of the asset 
to estimate the cash flows expected to be generated by a vessel  management has to make a large number of assumptions on future market performance the future level of charter rates  the level of commissions  on future operating performance the level of operating expenses  the costs of dry docks  the level of off hire and on inflation 
actual results could differ from these assumptions and the company may have in the future to record additional impairment charges not previously recognised 
in january  the company received appraisals for its fleet from leading independent shipbrokers 
the appraised value of the company s fleet was approximately million 
this indicated that the aggregate market value of the vessels was approximately equal to the carrying values 
the aggregate market value of the container carriers were approximately million above their carrying values while the aggregate market value of the gas carriers were million below their carrying values 
liquidity and sources of capital liquidity the company had  in cash available at december  as compared to  at december  in addition  at december   deposits totalling  december   were pledged to guarantee the company s performance under various loan agreements 
it should be noted that  was deposited in vessel operating accounts which are directly operated by the vessel technical managers  in 
the ratio of current assets to current liabilities increased from at december  to at december  following the sale of four containerships in july  the company s cash balances increased by approximately million and the current portion of long term debt decreased by million following the million prepayment of the nedship bank loan incurred in for the acquisition of such ships 
operating activities the company generated cash flows from operations of  in compared to  in the reduction is due to the sale of four vessels and to the dry docking of eight vessels in the four vessels sold in july were employed on a bareboat basis 
since they had no operating expenses see overview  the resulting reduction in cash flow from operations is equal to approximately of the reduction in revenues 
in  the company dry docked vessels for a total cost of million 
in addition to the cost of the dry docks  the company lost approximately days of revenues since charterers do not pay the hire during dry docks 
investing activities on july   the company sold four containerships to a non related party for  and prepaid the nedship bank loan outstanding amount of  the sale generated a net profit of  these vessels were not the ones earmarked for sale 
these funds have not yet been reinvested 
financing activities in  the company repaid net borrowings of  and reduced its long term debt including current portion from  as of december  to  as of december  the cash outlay was as follows scheduled repayments prepayment of one of scotiabank loans retirement of million of notes prepayment of the nedship bank loan as a result  as of december   the company s contractual obligations were as follows payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year to years to years senior notes due fortis bnp amortising loan due scotiabank amortising loan due total the company s long term bank debt is secured by certain of its vessels 
the bond indenture and the loan agreements contain various business and financial covenants see note to the consolidated financial statements 
guarantees in july  the company counter guaranteed  for an amount of euros  a performance bond issued in favour of a major european shipping group 
this bond was placed to support the company s submission to a tender offer for the acquisition of some of this group s vessels  together with a time charter back 
the tender offer was made jointly by a group of companies including the company  and the performance bond was issued by a bank 
in august  the company was advised that its offer had not been retained and the guarantee was released in october the company s obligations under the note indenture are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by substantially all of the company s vessel owning subsidiaries except for the unrestricted subsidiaries see note to the consolidated financial statements in item 
off balance sheet financial arrangements the company had no off balance sheet financial arrangements as of december contingencies in june  the company sold the built container vessel maersk tampa to a non affiliated company with the maersk charter attached 
in the event maersk does not extend the present charter at its expiry in november  the new owners have the option to give the vessel back on charter to the company for a period of eighteen months 
the charter rate will be  per day for twelve months and  per day for the remaining six months 
the aggregate amount of the commitment under this agreement is approximately  as follows total these amounts do not take into consideration any revenues the company will earn from chartering out the vessel to another party 
as of march  the current market rate for twelve month time charter of a vessel similar to the maersk tampa is well in excess of  so  the expected revenues from the chartering out of the vessel would cover the expected amount of the commitment 
there is no assurance to day  however  as to where market rates will be in november future cash requirements in  the company will have only one vessel to dry dock 
management believes that the net cash provided by operating activities will provide sufficient funds to enable the company to meet its liquidity requirements throughout  based on current levels of charter rates 
the company has currently no vessel earmarked for sale 
following the sale of four vessels in  management believes that the company has excess cash to invest and is looking actively at the acquisition of vessels 
however  the company does not currently have any significant commitments for capital expenditures 
actual results in will depend on the reinvestment of the excess cash 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate swaps in  the company had entered into an interest rate swap agreement  which is used to hedge the company s interest rate exposure associated with a long term loan see note long term debt 
as of december   the swap agreement had a notional amount of  a fair market value of  in favour of the bank and an interest rate of 
it will expire in september long term debt the company is subject to interest rate risk associated with certain variable rate long term debt as described below 
at december   the company had approximately  in variable rate long term debt outstanding which was not hedged by interest rate swaps  corresponding to the outstanding amount of the credit facility of  granted in june to the company by fortis bank and bnp 
the facility bears interest at libor plus and matures in june for every one percent variation in interest rate  the interest expense would vary by  impact of currency fluctuations the company s functional currency is the us dollar  however  a number of transactions are performed in other currencies
