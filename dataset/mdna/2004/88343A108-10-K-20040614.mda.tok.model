item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we develop  manufacture  market and service process control metrology systems for use in the manufacture of semiconductors and control significant market share in the metrology industry 
process control metrology is used to monitor process parameters in order to enable semiconductor manufacturers to maintain high yields on the production lines  reduce feature size  increase wafer size  increase equipment productivity and improve device performance 
our metrology systems are used in all sections of the semiconductor fabrication plant  or fab  to control the wafer fabrication processes 
examples of wafer fab processes  in which our metrology systems supply key information  are photoresist processing to support lithography  deposition of insulator and conductor films  patterned removal  or etching  of insulator and conductor films  ion implantation and chemical mechanical planarization 
we currently sell four product families of process control metrology systems therma probe systems  opti probe systems  opti probe cd systems  and integra integrated metrology systems 
therma probe product family 
therma probe systems utilize our proprietary thermal wave technology and are non destructive process control metrology systems used to measure the critical ion implantation process on product wafers in the fabrication of semiconductors 
therma probe systems have a major share of the market 
opti probe product family 
opti probe film metrology systems provide the industry s most powerful capability to control and diagnose non opaque films for semiconductor production 
this unsurpassed metrology power is achieved by successfully integrating different measurement technologies  including optical technologies that are proprietary to our company  into each opti probe system 
opti probe cd product family 
opti probe cd systems measure the critical dimensions  or cd  representing the device structures  using a revolutionary  nondestructive technique based on spectroscopic ellipsometry 
these systems are capable of providing cd metrology for the smallest features of the next several generations of ics 
integra product family 
the integra line of integrated metrology products is a broad based family of compact metrology modules which are installed on and function in conjunction with an ic process system  such as an etching system or cvd deposition system  to provide metrology on each wafer before it exits the process tool 
management overview our mission our mission can be stated in simple terms we want to help our customers achieve their goals  which will in turn help us achieve ours 
therma wave develops  manufactures  markets and services process control metrology systems for use in the manufacture of semiconductors 
our customers must have metrology equipment to improve their yields  an essential element to improving their profits 
a significant number of our customers are now expanding their wafer production capacity while moving from millimeter to new millimeter technology 
the industry is also advancing to smaller geometries for semiconductor device production  currently at the nm technology node and advancing to nm and in the future advancing to the nm technology node 
these technology advances will significantly increase the requirement to improve yields 
our products our core products include the latest generations of our therma probe and opti probe metrology systems 
our core markets  remain the thin film and ion implant measurement markets that we successfully addressed for nearly million of revenue during the peak year of the last semiconductor industry cycle 
our new products include our optical rt cd product family and our integrated product line  integra 
all of our new and latest generation products  which taken together accounted for approximately of our total systems 
table of contents new order bookings in fiscal year  are in keeping with our objective to stay at the forefront of technology leadership in metrology for the semiconductor industry 
our new products and technologies for critical dimension and integrated metrology substantially expand our target markets going forward 
therma wave introduced its opti probe real time critical dimension system  opti probe rt cd  in this product combines a powerful computer and therma wave proprietary software with our standard series opti probe and has moved therma wave into a market not previously served by the company 
opti probe rt cd has positioned us to compete for business previously served by manufacturers of scanning electronic microscopes  known as cd sem 
cd sem is becoming non competitive in certain advanced technologies of nm and smaller 
we believe that our opti probe rt cd product can address some cd requirements faster  better and at a substantially lower cost of ownership to the customer 
where cd sem is an expensive low throughput technology  opti probe rt cd can do the same thing faster and with more precision 
we believe the superiority of opti probe rt cd will become even greater as fabs move to nm and then to nm 
we believe the total critical dimension market could be as much as million to million in calendar year based on gartner dataquest market information 
optical products may take an increasing share of this market as technology nodes decrease in size 
also in  we introduced our first integrated critical dimension metrology product  integra  which we sell primarily to an original equipment manufacturer of integrated circuit process systems 
this product is a family of compact metrology modules that are installed on and function in conjunction with the ic process system 
we are rated by tokyo electron as their class supplier for integrated cd metrology on their market leading photoresist track system 
therma wave has an installed base of more than  systems and has systems located at nearly every major semiconductor manufacturer in the world 
therma wave has never been a low price competitor 
our strength has been technology from the beginning of the company  when the therma probe product dominated a market niche 
we have protected our technology with us and foreign patents as of the end of fiscal we have a broad range of applications  with products that are reliable and have a low cost of ownership due to their capabilities  not necessarily due to their price 
we also have a reputation for excellent customer support and we again last year ranked ahead of our top competitor in vlsi s customer support survey 
we have a worldwide customer support organization of approximately people located very close to all our major customers 
we have subsidiaries in japan  the uk and china and branch locations or offices in taiwan  hong kong  israel  and ireland  as well as several locations in the us we also have representatives or distributors in germany  france  italy  singapore and japan 
to be competitive  our products must be extendable  provide low cost of ownership and help our customers to continuously meet the ever advancing technology nodes challenge 
some of our customers are currently moving or planning to move from nm to nm and will begin moving to nm as the next step 
they will not purchase products from a supplier who they believe cannot continue to enable them to advance and meet those technology changes 
therma wave products have demonstrated the capability to be extendable and meet those challenges in the past and we believe our products are well positioned to meet those requirements for the future 
our market and market share based on the gartner dataquest january industry survey information  it is estimated that the total process control market will grow to approximately billion by calendar year of that  approximately billion is expected to be the metrology segment 
therma wave is targeting the transparent thin film  critical dimension and overlay segments of this market  which is estimated to be approximately billion by our goal is to capture a minimum of of this market  plus a major share of the ion implant process measurement market  and plus normal upgrades and service and support 
the ion implant market is actually included as a small part of the opaque film market by gartner dataquest  and we believe this market will be between million and million in calendar year  most of which we expect to capture 
if achieved  
table of contents this could provide therma wave with million or more of total revenues in our fiscal year if not achieved  we will not see the benefits of such revenue growth 
as reported by the gartner dataquest industry survey  our opti probe products in the standalone non metal thin film metrology market increased market share from in calendar to in calendar our opti probe rt cd product also made strong market share gains  improving from in to in calendar this product was introduced in the second half of it is also noteworthy that the total market for optical critical dimension measurement equipment more than doubled  from million in to million in we believe this growth will continue and even accelerate further 
new orders the semiconductor industry has just gone through its longest and deepest downturn in its history 
therma wave was severely impacted 
however  our orders and order activity increased during our fiscal third and fourth quarters of in our fiscal third quarter  we reported an increase in orders from the previous quarter  which resulted in shipments increasing by over in the fiscal fourth quarter 
our order rates for the last two quarters of our fiscal year were at the highest level they have reached since our fiscal year although the industry orders picture is still somewhat unclear  we believe that business overall in the semiconductor industry is improving 
in fiscal  we also substantially increased our total number of customers worldwide to whom we sold systems to customers worldwide  up from the previous year 
we sold products to eight of the top ten capital spending companies in the world in semiconductor manufacturing capital facilities and equipment  up from seven of the top ten in the previous year 
we more than doubled our metrology systems orders to approximately million in fiscal year  up from approximately million the previous year 
in addition to the overall growth in orders  it is important to note that our new leading edge products grew as a percentage of our product mix 
the advanced therma probe systems grew from  or million  of total systems orders in fiscal to  or million  of total systems orders in fiscal the advanced opti probe systems grew from  or million  to  or million  of total systems orders 
also  of total systems booked during the year were for millimeter business  which we feel is significant because it demonstrates that customers are accepting our more advanced products 
geographically  in our fiscal  european business strengthened and we recaptured business in korea 
we opened a new subsidiary in shanghai to service the new business in china 
overall for the fiscal year  of systems orders came from asia excluding japan  came from japan  from europe and from the united states 
this compared to of systems orders from asia excluding japan  from japan  from europe and from the united states for the fiscal year we believe the distribution of new orders in fiscal fourth quarter of is significant  indicating a broad market penetration  particularly the strong growth in europe  korea and taiwan 
net revenues during fiscal  quarterly net revenues bottomed at between and million per quarter in the fiscal second and third quarters  then turned up to million in the fiscal fourth quarter of we continued to make progress during fiscal year  and net revenues for the fiscal fourth quarter of were million 
sequentially  net revenues in the fiscal fourth quarter decreased by million from the fiscal third quarter  however fiscal third quarter included million of our standard products and services and million of revenue related to a development program that ended during the fiscal third quarter 
therefore  fiscal fourth quarter net revenues from standard products and services actually increased by million or 
net revenues for the fiscal year ended march  totaled million compared to million for fiscal year  an increase of million or 
this reflects the industry wide upturn in purchases of semiconductor metrology capital equipment 

table of contents margins gross margins improved steadily throughout fiscal year and continued this improvement in the fiscal fourth quarter  benefiting both from the higher volume and from cost reduction efforts 
our gross margins averaged for our fiscal third quarter  including million of margin from a development program that ended during the quarter and averaged for our standard products and services in addition to million from the conclusion of the development program mentioned above 
our third fiscal quarter gross margin from standard products and services benefited from the sale of million  or of revenues  of inventory that had previously been written off  and was reduced by new inventory charges of million  or of revenues 
we improved gross margins for standard products and services to in the fiscal fourth quarter of  which includes the benefit of million  or of revenues  from the sale of previously written off inventory and the reduction of million  or of revenues  due to new charges to inventory in the fourth fiscal quarter 
we ended fiscal year with average gross margins of negative  including new inventory charges of million  or of net revenues  and the benefit from the sale of million  or of net revenues  of inventory that had previously been written off 
we improved gross margins in fiscal year to over  including the benefit from the sale of million  or of net revenues  of inventory previously written off and the reduction due to new inventory charges of million  or of net revenues 
net revenues from our millimeter standalone tools increased to of total net revenues for our fiscal fourth quarter  up from the fiscal third quarter in addition  of our new orders for the same period were for millimeter products indicating that this trend should continue 
the significance of this product mix to margins is that our millimeter products are less mature and therefore margins on these systems are lower than on older  more mature millimeter products 
cost reduction programs are under way to improve our millimeter product margins 
for the fiscal fourth quarter  we fully absorbed our factory overhead for the first time in more than two years due to higher production volumes 
this is important because it means that any additional volume growth begins to reduce the average overhead cost per tool produced  thereby reducing the average total cost per tool 
however  our margins continued to be unfavorably impacted by lower than optimum production levels 
operating expenses during fiscal  our efforts were directed toward managing our operating expenses to be in line with business conditions 
total operating expenses for the fiscal fourth quarter decreased by approximately million from the fiscal third quarter 
this decrease was due primarily to non cash charges for variable accounting treatment for stock options of approximately million that were incurred in the fiscal third quarter  compared to a credit of million recorded for the variable accounting treatment for stock options in the fiscal fourth quarter 
the credit occurred because our stock price decreased from quarter to quarter 
operating expenses for all costs other than the variable accounting treatment for stock options were up about million from our fiscal third quarter  an increase of approximately 
for fiscal  operating expenses were million  down from million in fiscal fiscal included charges of million for the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets related to the sensys acquisition 
excluding the million impairment charges  fiscal expenses were million 
the reduction in operating expenses other than impairment charges in fiscal compared to fiscal reflects an labor savings due to reductions in force  lower direct material charges due to the timing of development activities  a reduction in spending on outside services  and lower costs for marketing programs  travel  and facilities and information systems support 
in fiscal  we expect to manage operating expenses in line with revenues  increasing over time as the business grows  but declining as a percentage of revenues  thereby improving profitability 

table of contents net loss our net loss for the fiscal fourth quarter was million or per diluted share  including the sale of inventory with an original cost of million  or per share that had previously been written off  and was reduced by new inventory charges of million  or per share 
this compared to a net loss for the fiscal third quarter of million  or per diluted share  that benefited from the sale of inventory with an original cost of million that had previously been written off  and that was reduced by new inventory charges of million  or per share 
however  our fiscal third quarter also benefited from approximately million of net income  or approximately per diluted share  recognized from the ending of a development program 
the net loss from the sale of our standard products and services for the fiscal third quarter was million or per diluted share 
our net loss for the fiscal year was million or per diluted share compared to a loss of million or per diluted share for fiscal year however  our fiscal year benefited from approximately million of net income  or approximately per diluted share  recognized from the ending of the development program mentioned earlier 
our fiscal year also benefited from the sale of inventory that originally had cost million  or per share that had previously been written off  and was reduced by million  or per share  in new inventory charges 
the fiscal year results included non cash charges of million  or per share  for the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets originating from the january acquisition of sensys 
the fiscal year net loss also benefited from the sale of inventory that originally cost million  or per share  that had previously been written off  and was reduced by million  or per share  in new inventory charges 
balance sheet our balance sheet was strengthened significantly during our last two quarters of fiscal cash and short term investments totaled million at march  an increase of million from the million reported as of december  and million reported at september  this compares to cash and restricted cash as of the end of fiscal of million 
cash improvements were due primarily to million in net proceeds raised in a private offering completed on september   increased accounts receivable collections due to improved net revenues and reduced receivables days sales outstanding and sale of inventory  including the sale of inventory that had originally cost million but that had later been written off prior to sale 
our receivables days sales outstanding  or dso  ended the fiscal fourth quarter of at days and was improved to days for our fiscal fourth quarter of we have no long term debt  and we have access to million in credit facilities that are unused other than for supporting standby letters of credit 
in previous communications to shareholders and the investment community  we identified inventory controls as a key component for the success of the company 
in the fiscal fourth quarter inventory increased by approximately million  the first increase in more than a year due primarily to increased purchasing of parts to accommodate the shift in product mix from millimeter products to millimeter products and also due to the increased manufacturing and sales volume 
we also continued to sell previously written off millimeter inventory 
summary our financial performance has significantly improved in the past year and we expect that improvement to continue 
our goal is that this improvement will bring us back to profitability during the current fiscal year 
our management team is lead by boris lipkin  who joined therma wave as our ceo in february mr 
lipkin has brought together a new team  most of which was assembled during fiscal year we have a new chairman  papken der torossian  former chairman and ceo of silicon valley group  who joined the board in march and in march of we added three new board members peter handley  recently retired as president of novellus  larry tomlinson  recently retired treasurer of hewlett packard and nam pyo suh  professor and director of the manufacturing institute at mit 
mr 
tomlinson is also now chairman of our audit committee 

table of contents by far our most important goal for fiscal year is to return the company to profitability 
we undertook a course of action at the beginning of our fiscal year that started producing the expected results 
during the year  our orders activity continued to improve  gross margins continued to improve and our losses were substantially reduced 
in total our fiscal year was a substantial improvement over the previous year and confirms that our company is headed in the right direction 
this does not mean that we are satisfied  but we are pleased with our fiscal year performance 
looking forward the timing of orders and shipments continues to be difficult to predict  but we expect both orders and net revenues to steadily increase quarter by quarter during our fiscal year at least in the fiscal first quarter we expect gross margins to be influenced by the continued mix shift from millimeter products to millimeter products  and pricing pressures  though lessening to continue  slowing margin improvement  possibly offsetting potential margin improvements from higher volume 
operating expenses are expected to be higher due to higher research and development project costs  higher sales commissions that result from the increased new orders  and from expenses related to sarbanes oxley act compliance 
we expect a net loss in the fiscal first quarter however  we continue to believe that our profitability will improve during fiscal year  aided by expected further improvements in orders and shipments and a growing benefit from ongoing cost reduction efforts 
as mentioned earlier  cash and short term investments totaled million at march  an increase of million from the million reported as of december  our inventory increased in our fiscal fourth quarter for the first time in more than a year 
we believe that growth in new orders and revenues and continued change in product mix  going toward more millimeter products will increase inventories further and that trade receivables will also begin to increase in our fiscal first quarter of we expect this trend to continue at least through the first two quarters of our fiscal year and to require an investment in net working capital in our fiscal first quarter and possibly in the fiscal second quarter 
we believe that we have adequate cash to fund this working capital growth 
however  if required  we have access to million in credit facilities available through our bank 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the methods  estimates and judgments we use in applying our accounting policies has a significant impact on the results we report in our consolidated financial statements 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  inventory  allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  valuation of long lived assets and intangible assets  income taxes and warranty 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
an accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact the financial statements 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect its significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
the following descriptions of critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and other disclosures included in this report 

table of contents revenue recognition effective april   we changed our method of accounting for revenue recognition in accordance with securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 or sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
in december  the securities exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 or sab  revenue recognition  which superceded sab sab is a codification of other revenue recognition pronouncements and in substance does not change sab revenues are recognized when the contractual obligations have been performed  title and risk of ownership have passed to the customer  collectibility of the sales price has been reasonably assured and customer final acceptance has been obtained  if applicable 
freight terms of sales are fob shipping point unless otherwise negotiated and agreed in written form between our customers and us 
shipments typically are made in compliance with shipment requirements specified in our customer s purchase order 
systems revenues 
equipment sales are accounted for as multiple element arrangement sales that require the deferral of a significant portion of revenues in the amount of the greater of fair market value of installation and a percentage of payment subject to final acceptance 
systems revenues are allocated to each component of the multiple element arrangement 
revenues on each element are recognized when the contractual obligations have been performed  title and risk of ownership have passed to the customer  collectibility of the sales price has been reasonably assured and customer final acceptance has been obtained  if applicable 
estimated contractual warranty obligations are recorded when related systems sales are shipped 
systems revenues on newly introduced products are deferred at shipment and recognized upon customer final acceptance 
systems revenues are also deferred when the customer has the right to return the product for credit 
in such cases  systems revenues are not recognized until all of the following conditions have been evidenced after the customer s purchase order has been fulfilled the right of return has expired and any potential returns would require authorization by our company under warranty provisions  the price of the sales is fixed or determinable  the payment terms are fixed and enforceable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
in accordance with sab  we evaluate our systems sales to determine the appropriate timing for revenue recognition for each of the multiple elements involved in each sale 
this sometimes results in deferrals of revenues from the period in which the tool is shipped to future periods 
services revenues 
we derive services revenues from three primary sources sale of spare parts  service contracts and service labor 
revenues on the sale of spare parts are recognized when title and risk of ownership have transferred to the customer and collectibility of the sales price has been reasonably assured 
revenues on service contracts are deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the period of the contract 
revenues on time and material services performed are recognized when the services are completed  collectibility of the sales price has been reasonably assured and customer final acceptance has been obtained  if applicable 
inventory we value our inventory at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
due to changing market conditions  estimated future requirements  age of the inventories on hand and our production of new products  we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision to write down excess and obsolete inventory to its estimated net realizable value 
a significant increase in the demand for our product could result in a short term increase of inventory purchases while a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the charges for excess inventory quantities on hand 
in addition  our industry is subject to technological change  new product development  and product technological obsolescence that could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand 
therefore  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and reported operating results 
when we record additional reserves for excess and obsolete inventory  we create a new cost basis for the inventory 
the reserve is only released if and when the reserved inventory is sold or scrapped  which is in accordance with sab the inventory charge in fiscal was million  and was million in fiscal 
table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts receivables we utilize estimates in determining our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable and reserve for potential returns for credit 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience  any specific customer collection issues that we have identified  and the aging of the accounts receivable 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  there is no assurance that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of our customers could have a material adverse impact on the collectibility of our accounts receivable and our future operating results 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets we have adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 or sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets and sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles and long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review of such assets include the following significant under performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles and long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure the impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our business model 
while we believe that our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable  different assumptions regarding such cash flows could materially affect our evaluations 
in fiscal year we wrote off million in regards to the impairment of goodwill and other intangibles associated with the sensys acquisition 
income taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability approach  which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements  but have not been reflected in our taxable income 
a valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets to their estimated realizable value 
we provide a valuation allowance to the extent we cannot conclude  based on available objective evidence  that it is more likely than not we will generate sufficient taxable income in future periods to realize the benefit of our deferred tax assets 
predicting future taxable income is difficult  and requires the use of significant judgment 
warranty we provide warranty coverage for a predetermined amount of time  on systems and parts for material and labor to repair and maintain the equipment 
we record the estimated cost of systems and parts warranty upon shipment of tools  based on the average historical warranty expense for a specific tool 
should actual costs or material usage differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability may be required 

table of contents results of operations the following table summarizes our historical results of operations as a percentage of net revenues for the periods indicated 
fiscal year net revenues cost of revenues gross profit loss operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative in process research and development impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets restructuring  severance and other stock based compensation total operating expenses operating loss other income expense  net interest expense interest income other income expense  net total other income expense  net loss before benefit for income taxes benefit for income taxes net loss due to the increase in net revenues in fiscal compared to fiscal  cost of net revenues and operating expense as a percentage of net revenues declined  reducing the net loss as a percentage of revenues 
included in the changes from fiscal compared to fiscal  among other changes  are in millions of net of net net revenues revenues gross profit net loss revenues the conclusion of a development contract lower operating expenses due to the fiscal impairment of goodwill and other intangibles increase in the sale of inventory that had been previously written off increase in new charges to inventory for excess and obsolescence due to a decline in net revenues in fiscal compared to fiscal  cost of net revenues increased as a percentage of net revenues  as did operating expenses  increasing the net loss as a percentage of net revenues in fiscal compared to fiscal fiscal results included in millions a charge of million  or of net revenues  for the write down of inventory 
table of contents a benefit from the sale of million  or of net revenues  of inventory previously written off a million charge for the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets related to the sensys acquisition fiscal year ended march  compared to fiscal year ended march  net revenues 
net revenues for the fiscal years ended march  and were million and million  respectively 
compared to fiscal  net revenues in fiscal increased million or primarily as a result of capital spending increases in the semiconductor industry 
we sold more units of our therma probe and opti probe products in fiscal and the average selling price increased in fiscal due to a shift in business towards newer  more expensive models 
we experienced strong price competition during both fiscal and fiscal the following table summarizes our revenues in different categories as a percentage of total net revenues for the periods indicated 
fiscal years ended march  products services and parts total net revenues the fluctuations in these percentages are related primarily to the changes in the amount of metrology capital equipment being purchased by the semiconductor industry from one year to the next 
sales of service contracts and parts tend to reflect the installed base of systems previously sold rather than current system sales 
as a result  the dollars of such sales do not fluctuate as widely as systems sales  and therefore represent a higher percentage of net revenues when product sales are lower 
net revenues attributable to international sales for the fiscal years ended march  and accounted for of our total revenues for each of these two periods 
we anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues in the foreseeable future  because of the concentration of large customers in asia 
a substantial portion of our international sales is denominated in us dollars 
as a result  changes in the values of foreign currencies relative to the value of the us dollar can render our products comparatively more expensive 
although we have not been negatively impacted in the past by foreign currency changes in japan  korea  china  taiwan  singapore  israel and europe  such conditions could negatively impact our international sales in future periods 
demand for semiconductors and semiconductor equipment increased during our fiscal year as a result  we increased the number of our customers and experienced higher order booking rates than in the previous fiscal year 
the increased orders resulted in higher revenues for systems shipments and an increase in our ending backlog 
the increased revenues materially improved our financial position and results of operations in fiscal compared to the previous year 
we expect that the revenues for the first quarter of fiscal year will increase to from the fiscal fourth quarter of and that both orders and revenues will improve gradually by quarter in fiscal year however  due to the uncertainty of economic conditions  the market response to our newly introduced products and the timing of revenue recognition of our new products  we can give no assurance that we will be able to meet our revenue expectations 
gross profit loss 
gross profit increased to million in fiscal from a million gross loss in fiscal  a total change of million 
as a percentage of net revenues  gross profit increased from 
table of contents in fiscal to in fiscal key contributors to this improvement in gross profits can be summarized as follows gross profit key contributors to cost of sales improvement improvement percent increased systems revenues increased sale of inventory previously written off decreased in new inventory charges overhead spending reductions termination of a development contract favorable resolution of accrued tax exposure total roughly one quarter of the improvement in gross profit reflects systems revenue increases in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total net revenues 
systems revenues  which contribute relatively higher gross margins  grew by in fiscal compared to fiscal  while service revenues  which contribute relatively lower gross margins  declined by in fiscal compared to fiscal increased demand for systems improved the margins in several others ways  specifically by enabling the sale of inventory that had been previously reserved million  facilitating sales of systems that had been used internally for demonstration and testing purposes  which generally have a lower cost basis than new systems million  and improving overhead absorption of fixed costs million 
overhead spending was reduced by over million dollars  due to reductions in labor and discretionary spending in fiscal compared to fiscal these spending reductions contributed approximately to the improvement in gross profit 
approximately of the gross margin improvement is due to the termination of a development agreement in the third fiscal quarter of  in which we recognized million of previously deferred revenues and gross profit of million 
approximately of the improvement is due to the favorable resolution in the third fiscal quarter of of a potential tax exposure in korea that we accrued in fiscal during fiscal  as a result of favorable economic conditions and increasing demand for semiconductor products  our gross profits included million for sales of previously reserved inventory and charges of million in new inventory reserves 
we also scrapped million of previously reserved inventory 
this compares to our gross loss in fiscal year in which we experienced a decline in sales and recorded an inventory charge of million related to excess and obsolete inventories  partially offset by the sale of million of inventory previously written off 
inventory charges recorded in fiscal have substantially lowered the net value of our mm inventory on hand and will have a significant impact on our gross margin if we are able to continue to sell our excess mm inventory in the future 
we have implemented or are in the process of implementing a number of cost reduction measures to improve our overall gross margin financial performance 
these cost reduction measures include  but are not limited to  sourcing and design initiatives to lower cost and improve product performance  tight controls on discretionary overhead spending  renegotiation of equipment maintenance contracts with vendors and so on 
we expect these cost reduction measures will contribute to gross margin improvements in fiscal research and development  or r d  expenses 
r d expenses were million and million for fiscal years and  respectively  a reduction of million  or 
r d expenses as a percentage of net revenues for fiscal decreased to from for fiscal due to both lower r d spending and the increase of net revenues in fiscal during fiscal year  in part due to reductions in force  labor and benefits costs were lower by million  or 
we also reduced the use of outside services by million  or 
spending on project materials declined by million  or 
other discretionary spending and allocations for facilities and information systems support declined by million  or 
we maintained the resources for our critical programs such as our real time critical dimension product  or rt cd 
we believe that technological leadership is essential to strengthen our market position in the next economic upturn and 
table of contents expect to continue to commit significant resources to the development of new products and the continuous improvement of existing products 
therefore  we will continue to invest in r d during at levels similar to fiscal levels 
r d expenditures as a percentage of net revenues are expected to decrease gradually in fiscal as net revenues increase with improving industry conditions 
selling  general and administrative  or sg a  expenses 
sg a expenses were million and million for fiscal years and  respectively 
compared to fiscal  sg a expenses in fiscal decreased million  or 
the decrease in fiscal sg a expenses reflects lower headcount  partially due to reductions in force  resulting in savings of million  or 
spending on outside services declined by million  or 
commissions  however  increased by million in compared to reflecting increased orders and revenues 
other discretionary spending  such as travel and entertainment and allocations for facilities and information systems support declined by million  or 
sg a expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal primarily due to significantly higher net revenues in fiscal we expect sg a expenses will increase in fiscal primarily due to the costs related to compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act and to expansion of our selling  general and administrative activities as our business grows 
however  sg a expenditures as a percentage of net revenues may decrease gradually in fiscal as net revenues increase with improving industry conditions 
impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets 
due to operating losses  the absence of positive cash flows  significant declines in our common stock price and uncertainties resulting from the duration and severity of the industry downturn  we assessed the recoverability of the intangible assets related to the sensys acquisition subject to amortization in accordance with sfas no 
and tested goodwill related to the sensys acquisition for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
during the quarter ended september  in assessing the recoverability of the intangible assets related to the sensys acquisition in accordance with sfas no 
we projected significantly reduced future cash flows related to sensys products and therefore we recognized an impairment expense of million for developed technology  million for a development contract and million for trade name intangible assets in the quarter ended september  in addition  during the fourth quarter ended march   we recognized an additional impairment charge of million related to trade name intangible assets 
the impairment test under sfas no 
was based on a two step process involving comparing the estimated fair value of the related reporting unit to its net book value  and comparing the estimated implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying value 
as a result of the test  we wrote down goodwill assets by million in the quarter ended september  during the quarter ended december   due to the termination of a development agreement  we accelerated the amortization of million of the related development contract intangible assets 
restructuring  severance and other 
the following table summarizes the changes in restructuring  severance and other costs during the twelve months ended march  and in thousands liability as of liability as of march  non cash march  provision utilization settlement severance and workforce reduction consolidation of excess facilities other costs total 
table of contents liability as of liability as of march  non cash march  provision utilization settlement severance and workforce reduction consolidation of excess facilities fixed assets other costs total during fiscal  we recorded million in charges related to restructuring  severance and other costs 
of this amount  million relates to reductions in force in april and october of approximately and employees  respectively 
an additional million was recorded as leased facility charges during the second quarter of when we entered into a sublease on a previously vacated facility 
the million charge reflects the difference between the estimated sublease income and the actual sublease income for this facility 
as of the end of fiscal  liabilities that we had accrued for severance and other costs had been paid out in full 
during fiscal  we recorded million in charges related to restructuring  severance and other costs 
we closed down two facilities in santa clara  california to reduce operating expenses and recorded a million charge associated with the abandonment of leased facilities and write off of fixed assets 
we also implemented two reduction in force programs affecting approximately people and recorded million of severance and workforce reduction and million of other severance related costs 
stock based compensation 
stock based compensation charges reflect options assumed as part of the sensys acquisition in january and charges for options issued september  in the employee stock option exchange offer 
as part of the sensys acquisition  we assumed million of stock based compensation to be amortized over the vesting period of the options 
the amortization expense was million or of net revenues in fiscal and million or of net revenues in fiscal  of which  and  respectively  was included in cost of revenues 
we expect that the stock based compensation for options assumed in the sensys acquisition in fiscal will be lower than that of fiscal due to the forfeitures of options held by the sensys employees who left the company in fiscal during the second quarter of fiscal  we commenced and completed an employee stock option exchange program 
the voluntary program allowed therma wave employees  excluding officers and directors  to return to us existing options issued before july  with an exercise price greater than per share and exchange them for new options that were granted on september  the number of new options granted in the employee stock option exchange program was equal to of the number of options canceled in the exchange 
the new option grants have a different vesting schedule from the original option grants and have an exercise price equal to  the fair market value of our common stock on september  of the  options eligible for exchange   options  or  were exchanged for  new options with an exercise price of 
none of these replacement options vests before june  as a result of the modification to the exercise price of the stock options  the replacement options are accounted for as variable from the date of modification until the option is either exercised  forfeited  canceled or expired 
as of march   we have recorded approximately million in compensation expense related to the employee option exchange program 
this charge reflects three groups of options the new options issued in the exchange which were outstanding since september  options eligible for exchange that were not exchanged about of eligible options options issued to eligible participants within the six months prior to or following september  due to the options requiring variable accounting treatment  the expense is being recorded for the vesting of these options over time based on increases in the stock price over and above the exercise price of the new 
table of contents options 
in future quarters  the expense could increase as the vesting over time of these options increases and if the stock price increases 
reductions to expense may also be recorded if the stock price decreases  but such reductions will be limited to the net expense previously reported 
during fiscal  charges related to the variable accounting treatment of options were million 
however  on a quarterly basis these costs varied based on the amount of time the options were outstanding and on the quarter end closing stock price as follows fiscal year q q q fiscal year days outstanding ending stock price variable accounting charge credit we anticipate that expense amounts relating to the employee stock option exchange program will continue to vary from quarter to quarter reflecting both the vesting schedules of the options and the fluctuations in the quarter ending stock price 
our time vesting percentage calculations reflect the vesting schedules of the newly issued replacement options  which will vest on june   with the remaining vesting on april  or according to the specific performance vesting schedules of particular stock option grants 
other income expense 
other income expense includes interest expense  interest income  and other non operating income  net 
total other income expense for fiscal was million  compared to million in fiscal the decrease in fiscal compared to fiscal was attributable to lower interest income of million resulting from lower average interest rates as well as lower average investment balances that declined approximately million from fiscal to fiscal  offset by million in interest refunded from the internal revenue service in fiscal other expense recorded in fiscal includes a loss on the sale of an investment in the first quarter of fiscal in the amount of million 
we expect that other income in fiscal will be similar to that of fiscal due to continued low interest rates and a relatively steady average investment balance 
net loss 
the combination of all the factors discussed above contributed to a net loss of million for fiscal compared with a net loss of million in the prior fiscal year 
we expect that with our cost reduction programs and expense controls in place and with expected revenue increases in fiscal  we will continue to reduce our net loss amounts in the coming quarters of fiscal this forward looking statement excludes the impact of amounts relating to the variable accounting treatment of the employee stock option exchange program  which may either increase or decrease our net loss 
fiscal year ended march  compared to fiscal year ended march  net revenues 
net revenues for the fiscal year ended march  and were million and million  respectively 
both fiscal and fiscal results reflect our adoption of sab under sab  a portion of revenues are deferred until installation is complete and the customer accepts the system 
deferred revenues relative to service contracts are recognized over of the life of the related service contract 
compared to fiscal  net revenues in fiscal decreased million or 
the decrease in fiscal revenues was primarily attributable to the capital spending reductions in the semiconductor industry during fiscal  which were primarily related to the cyclical downturn of semiconductor manufacturers and the weakness of the global economy 
compared to fiscal  we sold fewer units of our therma probe and opti probe products in fiscal and the average selling price decreased in fiscal due to increased price competition 

table of contents the following table summarizes our revenues in different categories as a percentage of total net revenues for the periods indicated 
fiscal years ended march  net revenues product service and parts total net revenues net revenues attributable to product sales in the fiscal years ended march  and accounted for and of our total revenues for such periods  respectively 
gross profit loss 
gross profit loss decreased from a million gross profit in fiscal to a million gross loss in fiscal as a percentage of net revenues  gross profit decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal lower gross profit was primarily because of lower revenues and lower average selling price of products due to increased price competition in fiscal during fiscal  as a result of unfavorable economic conditions and diminished demand for semiconductor products  we experienced a decline in sales and recorded an inventory charge of million related to excess and obsolete inventories 
this million charge was offset by the reserve release of million for sales of previously reserved inventory 
this charge has been included in cost of revenues in our consolidated statement of operations 
at march   we had written down inventories on hand by million 
these charges were in addition to our normal inventory reserve and were primarily caused by a significant reduction in demand including reduced demand for our older technology products 
inventory charges recorded in fiscal and have substantially lowered the net value of our mm inventory on hand and will have a significant impact on our gross margin if we are able to sell our excess mm inventory in the future 
we implemented a number of cost reductions measures to improve our overall financial performance 
these cost reduction measures included  but are not limited to  reductions in workforce in all functional areas  restrictions in discretionary spending  renegotiation of equipment maintenance contracts with vendors 
research and development  or r d  expenses 
r d expenses were million and million for fiscal years and r d expenses as a percentage of net revenues for fiscal increased to from for fiscal primarily due to the decrease of net revenues in fiscal during fiscal year we continued to reduce contract labor costs and other discretionary expenses but maintained the resources for our critical programs such as our real time critical dimension product  or rt cd 
selling  general and administrative  or sg a  expenses 
sg a expenses were million and million for fiscal years and  respectively 
compared to fiscal  sg a expenses in fiscal increased million  or 
the increase in fiscal sg a expenses was due primarily to the legal and accounting fees associated with the investigation of a revenue recognition issue that we identified in fiscal  and the inclusion of a full year of sg a expense for sensys instruments corporation  which represented million 
in fiscal  two and half months of sg a expenses of sensys were included  which amounted to  the acquisition of sensys is discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
sg a expenses as a percentage of net revenues increased to in fiscal from in fiscal primarily due to significantly lower revenue levels in fiscal in process research and development 
in january  we acquired sensys in a transaction accounted for as a purchase 
the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired  including intangible assets  based on their estimated fair values 
the intangible assets included approximately million for acquired in process technology for various projects that did not have future alternative uses 
the value of the purchased in process technology was determined using the income approach  which discounts expected future cash flows from projects under development to their net present value 
each project was analyzed to determine the technological innovations included  the utilization of core technology  the complexity  cost and time to complete development  any alternative future use or current technological feasibility  and the stage of 
table of contents completion 
the cash flows derived from the in process technology projects were discounted at a rate of 
we believe this rate was appropriate given the risks associated with the technologies for which commercial feasibility had not been established 
the percentage of completion for each in process project was determined by identifying the elapsed time invested in the project as a ratio of the total time required to bring the project to technological and commercial feasibility 
at the date of the acquisition  the development of these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility  and the technology in process had no alternative future uses 
accordingly  these costs were expensed in the fourth quarter of fiscal impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets 
during the quarter ended september   due to operating losses  the absence of positive cash flows  significant declines in our common stock price and uncertainties resulting from the duration and severity of the industry downturn  we assessed the recoverability of the intangible assets related to the sensys acquisition subject to amortization in accordance with sfas no 
and tested goodwill related to the sensys acquisition for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
in assessing the recoverability of the intangible assets related to the sensys acquisition in accordance with sfas no 
we projected significantly reduced future cash flows related to sensys products and therefore we recognized an impairment expense of million for developed technology  million for development contract and million for trade name intangible assets in the quarter ended september  in addition  during the quarter ended march   we recognized an additional impairment charge of million related to trade name intangible assets 
the impairment test under sfas no 
was based on a two step process involving comparing the estimated fair value of the related reporting unit to its net book value  and comparing the estimated implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying value 
as a result of the test  we wrote down goodwill by million in the quarter ended september  restructuring  severance and other 
during fiscal  we recorded million charges related to restructuring  severance and other costs 
we closed down two facilities in santa clara  california to reduce operating expenses and recorded a million charge associated with the abandonment of these leased facilities and the write off of fixed assets 
we also implemented two reduction in force programs affecting approximately people and recorded million of severance and related costs 
during fiscal  we recorded million in severance charges as we reduced our workforce by approximately people to reduce operating costs 
stock based compensation 
as part of the acquisition of sensys  we assumed million of stock based compensation to be amortized over the vesting period of the options 
the amortization expense was million or of net revenues in fiscal and million or of net revenues in fiscal other income expense 
other income expense includes interest expense  interest income  and other non operating income expense  net 
total other income for fiscal was million  compared to million of total other income in fiscal the decrease from fiscal to fiscal was primarily due to lower investment balances 
benefit for income taxes 
the effective tax rate of for fiscal year was based upon our net tax loss for fiscal for fiscal  we recorded a million benefit for income taxes due to a change in the tax law that allowed us to carry back net operating losses for five years instead of two years under the previous law 
net loss 
net loss for fiscal was million  as compared to net loss of million for the prior fiscal year 
the loss in fiscal was primarily a result of decreased revenue  lower gross profit margin and charges recorded in the fiscal of million of goodwill and other intangible assets impairment  million of additional reserves for obsolete and excess inventories and million of restructuring  severance and other costs 
the loss in fiscal included charges of million for the write off of acquired ipr d and million additional reserves for obsolete and excess inventories 

table of contents recently issued accounting pronouncements in may  the financial accounting standard board  or fasb  issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
establishes standards for how companies classify and measure certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it requires companies to classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability or an asset in some circumstances 
sfas no 
was effective beginning the second quarter of fiscal we believe that the adoption of this standard has had and will continue to have no material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 
fin requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
fin was effective immediately for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after january  in december  the fasb issued a revision of fin  or fin r  that delayed the implementation date for certain interests created or acquired prior to january  until the first interim or annual period ending after march  fin r is effective immediately for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after january  since january   we have not invested in any entities we believe are variable interest entities 
for those arrangements entered into prior to february   we were required to adopt the provisions of fin r as revised december at the end of the first quarter of fiscal therma wave s adoption of fin r did not result in consolidation of any entities 
on march   the financial accounting standards board issued a proposed statement  share based payment  that addresses the accounting for share based payment transactions in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for equity instruments of the enterprise or liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprise s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
the proposed statement would eliminate the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and generally would require instead that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method 
it is anticipated that this exposure draft would be finalized during the summer of and would be required to be applied by public companies for years ended subsequent to december  backlog at march  and  our backlog was million and million  respectively 
our backlog consists of orders not yet shipped  deferred revenues for products that have been shipped and invoiced but have not yet been recognized as revenue in accordance with sab  recurring fees payable under support contracts with our customers and orders for spare parts and billable services  such as non recurring engineering services 
orders that are scheduled for shipment beyond the twelve month window are not included in backlog until they fall within the twelve month window 
orders are subject to rescheduling or cancellation by the customer  usually without penalty 
because of possible changes in product delivery schedules and cancellation of product orders and because our sales will sometimes reflect orders shipped in the same quarter that they are received  our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of actual sales for any succeeding period 
liquidity and capital resources our principal liquidity requirements are for working capital 
over the last three fiscal years  we have funded our operating activities principally from proceeds from the sale of common stock 
our cash and restricted cash balances increased by million during fiscal year to million as of march  from million as of march  the increase is primarily attributable to the million in net proceeds from a private placement in september in the offering  we raised million of gross 
table of contents proceeds and incurred million of issuance costs  million of which were payable to needham company who acted as placement agent 
we are using these funds for general corporate purposes 
cash flows used in operating activities was million and million for the years ended march  and  respectively 
the cash used in operating activities in fiscal years and was mainly due to the net loss in these two fiscal years of million and million  respectively 
included in the net loss for these two fiscal years were non cash charges of million and million  which include million and million for the two years  respectively  of non cash charges for depreciation and amortization of property  intangibles and deferred stock compensation  inventory charges of million and million for the two years respectively  and in fiscal  non cash charges of million for the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets  among other charges detailed in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
in addition to the cash flow impact of these non cash charges to net loss  changes in operating assets and liabilities generated million and million of cash flows from operations in fiscal and  respectively 
during fiscal  million cash was generated by changes in operating assets and liabilities 
accounts receivable increased by only million even though net revenues increased in fiscal compared to fiscal  resulting in a decrease in dso from at the end of fiscal to at the end of fiscal changes in inventories excluding the million non cash charges noted above were an increase of million 
inventory receipts were approximately equal to inventory reductions due to the sale  scrap and internal usage of inventory 
the sale of inventory included those inventories that had previously been fully written off but that had originally cost million 
we also scrapped inventories that had originally cost million but that had been previously fully written off 
accounts payable increased million in fiscal year accounts payable increases reflect that our purchases of new parts have increased due to increased net revenues and declining inventory 
deferred revenues decreased by million reflecting the termination of a development contract for which million in deferred revenues were recognized 
reductions in other assets contributed million in cash  and decreases in accrued and other liabilities used million in cash 
during fiscal year  cash generated from changes in assets and liabilities was million  and included reductions in accounts receivable of million reflecting declining revenues  inventory reductions of million  reductions in other assets of million  and an increase in deferred revenues of million  offset by cash used to reduce accounts payable by million 
decreases in accrued and other liabilities used million of cash 
during the year ended march   net cash provided by investing activities was million 
cash generated from investing activities includes a decrease in restricted cash of million and the sale of an investment for million 
at the beginning of fiscal  million cash was restricted due to the requirement of our insurance premium financing agreement 
this restriction was removed in late june  when the security for the insurance premiums was converted from restricted cash to a standby letter of credit under our new loan and security agreement with silicon valley bank 
in march  we renewed our annual insurance policies without re accessing the available insurance premium financing  so the letter of credit has expired as of the end of fiscal year cash used in investing activities includes investments in property and equipment of million and investments in our patent portfolio of million 
during the year ended march   net cash provided by investing activities was million  due primarily to the sale of short term investments of million offset by investments in restricted cash of million  million in purchases of property and equipment  and million invested in our patent portfolio 
cash used in investing activities includes investments in property and equipment and investments in our patent portfolio 
investments in property and equipment amounted to million and million for the years ended march  and  respectively 
our requirements for new capital investment have been relatively low in recent years  reflecting the industry downturn  in which we reduced our headcount and consolidated facilities 
investments in our patent portfolio were million and million for the years ended march  and  respectively  reflecting our ongoing commitment to technology inventions and patent protection 
for fiscal year  we expect investments in patents and property and equipment  consisting primarily of computer and test equipment  to continue at the relatively low levels of recent years 

table of contents cash generated from financing activities was million and million during the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively 
the increase is primarily due to the million  net of million of issuance costs  raised in a private placement during fiscal we also raised million cash from the issuance of common stock including the sale of treasury shares under our employee stock purchase plan and equity incentive plan 
in fiscal  we did not repurchase stock pursuant to the stock repurchase program discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements entitled treasury stock 
cash generated in financing activities in fiscal was million  of which million was generated from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan and equity incentive plan and for the exercise of warrants in connection with the sensys acquisition and million was used to repurchase stock pursuant to the stock repurchase program discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements entitled treasury stock 
off balance sheet commitments our off balance sheet commitments are limited to equipment operating leases  leases on office and manufacturing space and certain software license agreements  and commitments to vendors related to non cancelable purchase orders 
future payments due under these obligations as of march  are as follows in thousands payment due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years operating lease obligations purchase obligations minimum royalty payments cancellation fees total we indemnify some of our suppliers and customers for specified intellectual property rights pursuant to certain parameters and restrictions 
the scope of these indemnities varies  but in some instances includes indemnification for damages and expenses including reasonable attorney fees related to any misuse by us of the intellectual property 
no amounts have been accrued in respect of the indemnification provisions at march  credit facilities in june  we entered into a new loan and security agreement with silicon valley bank  or svb 
the new agreement includes a million domestic line of credit  including a sub limit of million for letters of credit  and a million export import bank of the united states  or exim  guaranteed revolving line of credit 
the bank credit facilities allow us to borrow money under the domestic line bearing interest at the svb prime rate plus floating 
the exim revolving line allows us to borrow money at svb prime rate plus floating 
we may request advances in an aggregate outstanding amount not to exceed the lesser of million total under the two lines or the borrowing base  in each case minus the aggregate face amount of outstanding letters of credit  including any drawn but unreimbursed letters of credit 
our borrowings under the svb and exim guaranteed credit facilities are secured by substantially all of our assets 
as of march   we had million in outstanding letters of credit under this agreement 
the credit facilities originally matured on june   but we have recently extended these facilities for one additional year 
as of march   we were in compliance with all the covenants in the agreement 
we believe that we have adequate cash on hand to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months 
however  if required  we also have access to these million of credit facilities 

table of contents inflation the impact of inflation on our business has not been material for the fiscal years ended march   and liquidity our principal sources of funds have been and are anticipated to be cash on hand million unrestricted as of march   cash flows from operating activities if any  borrowings under our bank credit facilities and the sale of common stock 
we have implemented various cost reduction programs during and subsequent to the end of fiscal to bring operating expenses in line with revenue projections 
we believe that with these cost reduction programs in place  we will reduce operating expenses significantly enough so that we will have adequate liquidity and capital resources to meet our current and future financial obligations for the next twelve months 
no assurance can be given  however  that this will be the case 
we may require additional equity or debt financing to meet our working capital requirements or to fund our research and development activities 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available  if required or  if available  will be on terms satisfactory to us 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we do not have any derivative financial instruments 
see also the discussion of forward looking statements in the first paragraph of item above 
market risk related to interest rates and foreign currency we are exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  however  we believe those risks to be not material in relation to our operations 
we do not have any derivative financial instruments 
interest rate risk as of march   our cash and cash equivalents included money market securities and investment grade commercial paper 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our investment portfolio 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we place our investments with high credit quality issuers 
the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity 
we have no cash flow exposure due to rate changes for cash equivalents and short term investments  as all of these investments are at market interest rates 
due to the short term duration of our investment portfolio  an immediate change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair market value of the portfolio 
therefore  we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on our securities portfolio 
foreign currency exchange risk we are primarily a us dollar functional currency entity 
a substantial portion of our international sales are denominated in us dollars and  as a result  we have relatively little exposure to foreign currency exchange risk with respect to sales 
we have determined that the functional currency of our foreign operations is the local currency in our international operations  which incur most of their expenses in the local currency 
the transactions denominated in currencies other than our functional currencies create gains and losses that are reflected in our consolidated statement of income 
foreign currency transaction gains losses are included in other income expense in our consolidated statements of operations and amounted to   and  for the years ended march    and  respectively 
we convert the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries into us dollars 
when there is a change in foreign currency exchange rates  the conversion of the foreign subsidiaries financial statements into 
table of contents us dollars leads to a translation gain or loss 
the accumulated effects of foreign translation rate changes related to net assets located outside the us are included as a component of stockholders equity 
as of march  we have an accumulated comprehensive loss of million consisting of foreign currency translation adjustments  down from million as of march  we do not use forward exchange contracts to hedge exposures denominated in foreign currencies or any other derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the effect of an immediate change in exchange rates would not have a material impact on our future operating results or cash flows
