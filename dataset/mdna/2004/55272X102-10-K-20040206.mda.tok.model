general mfa mortgage investments  inc  a self advised mortgage reit  is primarily engaged in the business of investing  on a leveraged basis  in arm mbs  which includes adjustable rate mbs and hybrid mbs  which have interest rates that are fixed for a specified period of time and  thereafter  generally reset annually 
the company s mbs portfolio consists primarily agency mbs and  to a lesser extent  high quality arm mbs  rated in one of the two highest rating categories by at least one of the rating agencies 
the company s investment policies also permit the acquisition of multi family apartment properties  investments in reit securities and other securities  however  such investments do not comprise a significant amount of the company s investments 
the company s principal business objective is to generate net income for distribution to its stockholders  resulting from the spread between the interest and other income it earns on its investments and the cost of financing such investments 
the company has elected to be taxed as a reit for federal income tax purposes 
pursuant to the current federal tax regulations  one of the requirements of maintaining its status as a reit is that the company must distribute at least of its annual taxable net income to its stockholders  subject to certain adjustments 
since june  the company has significantly increased its asset base by investing  on a leveraged basis  additional equity capital raised through public offerings of common stock 
as a result  the company has experienced significant growth in assets and earnings 
the company s total assets were billion at december   compared to billion at december  at december   of the company s assets consisted of agency mbs and mbs related receivables  aaa rated mbs and cash 
at december   the company also had indirect interests in three multi family apartment properties  containing a total of rental units  located in georgia  north carolina and nebraska 
the company currently holds its investments in these remaining properties for investment purposes 
the results of the company s operations are affected by various factors  many of which are beyond the control of the company 
the results of the company s operations primarily depend on  among other things  the level of its net interest income  the market value of its assets and the supply of and demand for such assets 
the company s net interest income  which reflects the amortization of purchase premiums  varies primarily as a result of changes in interest rates  borrowing costs and prepayment speeds  the behavior of which involves various risks and uncertainties 
prepayment speeds  as reflected by the cpr  and interest rates vary according to the type of investment  conditions in financial markets  competition and other factors  none of which can be predicted with any certainty 
in general  as prepayment speeds on the company s mbs portfolio increase  related purchase premium amortization increases  thereby reducing the net yield on such assets 
the cpr on the company s mbs portfolio averaged and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in addition to these factors  borrowing costs are further affected by the company s creditworthiness 
since changes in interest rates may significantly affect the company s activities  the operating results of the company depend  in large part  upon the ability of the company to effectively manage its interest rate and prepayment risks while maintaining its status as a reit 
the company also has risks inherent in its other assets  comprised of interests in multi family apartment properties and hedging instruments 
although these assets represent a small portion of the company s total assets  less than of the company s total assets at december   these assets have the potential of causing a material impact on the company s operating performance in future periods

quarter ended cpr december  september  june  march  december  the company believes that the cpr in future periods will depend  in part  on changes in and the level of market interest rates across the yield curve  with higher cprs expected during periods of declining interest rates and lower cprs expected during periods of rising interest rates

during  the company earned an insignificant fee related to such services rendered by mfa spartan i  llc and does not expect that income related to such business will be material to the company in the foreseeable future 
the company continues to explore alternative business strategies  alternative investments and other strategic initiatives to compliment the company s core business strategy of investing  on a leveraged basis  in high quality arm mbs 
no assurance  however  can be provided that any such strategic initiative will or will not be implemented in the future

during  the company did not have any income on corporate debt or equity securities  as all such investments were sold during the company does not currently expect to invest in such instruments 
the company s interest expense decreased by million  or  to million for  compared to million for this decrease reflects a decline in the company s interest rate paid on its borrowings  which was partially offset by the impact of the significant increase in average borrowings under repurchase agreements

at december   the company had indirect interests in three rental properties  two of which are consolidated and one is accounted for under the equity method 
at the present time  the company expects to hold such properties and or related interests for investment purposes  as the purchase of the underlying properties were made through a tax deferred transaction under section of the code 
upon acquiring the remaining interest in rcc on october   the company changed its accounting for rcc from the equity method  whereby the net results of rcc s operations were reported as a component of income loss from equity interests in real estate  to consolidating rcc s results of operations with those of the company

critical accounting policies management has the obligation to insure that its policies and methodologies are in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
during  management reviewed and evaluated its critical accounting policies and believes them to be appropriate 
the company s accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and all majority owned and controlled subsidiaries 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to makes estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
in preparing these consolidated financial statements  management has made its best estimates and judgements of certain amounts included in the consolidated financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
the company does not believe that there is a great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported related to accounting policies described below 
however  application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgement and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
the company s accounting policies are described in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  included under item management believes the more significant of these to be as follows classifications of investment securities and valuations of such securities the company s investments in mbs are classified as available for sale securities  as discussed in note b to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  included under item although all of the company s mbs are carried on the balance sheet at their estimated fair value  the classification of the securities as available for sale results in changes in estimated fair value being recorded as adjustments to accumulated other comprehensive income loss  which is a component of stockholders equity  rather than through earnings 
the company does not intend to hold any its securities for trading purposes  however  if available for sale securities were classified as trading securities  there could be substantially greater volatility in the company s earnings 
as noted above  all of the company s mbs are carried on the balance sheet at estimated fair value 
the estimated fair values of such assets reflect the average of price quotes received from brokers and prices obtained from an independent pricing service  all of which are reviewed by the company 
when the estimated fair value of an available for sale security is less than amortized cost  management considers whether there is an other than temporary impairment in the value of the security 
if  in management s judgment  an other than temporary impairment exists  the cost basis of the security is written down to the then current estimated fair value  with the amount of impairment charged to current earnings 
the determination of other than temporary impairment is a subjective process  and different judgments and assumptions could affect the timing of loss realization 
see note b to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  included under item interest income recognition interest income on the company s mbs is accrued based on the actual coupon rate and the outstanding principal balance of such securities 
premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted into interest income over the lives of the securities using the effective yield method  as adjusted for prepayments in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards fas no 
 accounting for nonrefundable fees and costs associated with originating or acquiring loans and initial direct costs of leases 
see note b to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  included under item derivative financial instruments and hedging activities the company applies the provisions of fas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  fas as amended by fas no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities fas 
in accordance with fas  a derivative  which is designated as a hedge  is recognized as an asset liability and measured at estimated fair value 
to qualify for hedge accounting  at inception of the cap  the company must anticipate that the hedge will be highly effective in limiting the company s cost beyond the cap threshold on its matching on an aggregate basis anticipated repurchase agreements during the active period of the cap 
as long as the hedge remains effective  changes in estimated fair value are included in the accumulated other comprehensive income portion of stockholders equity 
upon the cap agreement active period commencing  the premium paid to enter into the cap agreement is amortized and reflected in interest expense 
the periodic amortization of the premium expense is based on an estimated allocation of the premium  determined at inception of the hedge based on the original purchase price 
payments received in connection with the cap agreement will be reported a reduction to interest expense  net of the amortization recognized for the premium 
if it is determined that a cap agreement is not effective  the premium would be reduced and a corresponding charge made to interest expense  for the ineffective portion of the cap agreement 
the maximum cost related to the company s cap agreements is limited to the original purchase price of the derivative 
in order to limit credit risk associated with cap agreements  the company s current policy is to only purchase caps from financial institutions rated a or better by one of the rating agencies 
income generated by the company s caps  if any  would offset interest expense on the hedged liabilities 
in order to continue to qualify for and to apply hedge accounting  cap agreements are monitored on a quarterly basis to determine whether they continue to be effective or  if prior to the commencement of the active period  whether the cap expects to continue to be effective 
if during the term of the cap agreement the company determines that a cap is not effective or that a cap is not expected to be effective  the ineffective portion of the cap will no longer qualify for hedge accounting and  accordingly  subsequent changes in its estimated fair value will be reflected in earnings

the company has determined that such entity  in addition to being immaterial to the company  does not meet the definition of a special purpose entity  which would have required that such entity be consolidated beginning with the fourth quarter of further  the company has not guaranteed any obligations of this unconsolidated entity nor does the company have any commitment or intent to provide additional funding to such entity 
accordingly  the company is not materially exposed to any market  credit  liquidity or financing risk related to its limited partner interest accounted for under the equity method 
the adoption of financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
consolidation of variable interest entities  as revised in december fin such that the limited partner interest will be consolidated with the company commencing in the first quarter of the adoption of fin will not have a material impact on the company s results of operations or statement of financial condition 
see note m to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  included under item impairment of long lived assets real estate investments held directly or through joint ventures represent long lived assets for accounting purposes 
the company periodically reviews long lived assets to be held and used in operations for impairment in value whenever any events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
in management s opinion  based on this analysis  real estate and investments in joint ventures are considered to be held for investment and are not carried at amounts in excess of their estimated fair value 
income taxes the company s financial results generally do not reflect provisions for current or deferred income taxes 
management believes that the company has and intends to continue to operate in a manner that will continue to allow it to be taxed as a reit and as a result does not expect to pay substantial corporate level taxes 
many of these requirements  however  are highly technical and complex 
if the company were to fail to meet the reit requirements  the company would be subject to federal  state and local income taxes 
accounting for stock based compensation on january   the company adopted fas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by fas no 
accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  fas 
the adoption of fas did not have an impact on the company as all outstanding options were fully vested at the time fas was adopted 
however  the company recorded an expense of  during the fourth quarter of related to options and related ders granted to employees of the company on october  the future effect of fas will be based on  among other things  the underlying terms of any future grants of stock based compensation 
estimating the fair value of stock options requires that assumptions are made  which are subjective 
see note a to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  included under item liquidity and capital resources the company s principal sources of liquidity consist of borrowings under repurchase agreements  principal payments received on its portfolio of mbs  cash flows generated by operations and proceeds from capital market transactions 
the company s most significant uses of cash include purchases of mbs and dividend payments on its common stock 
in addition  the company also uses cash to fund operations  make purchases of hedging instruments and make such other investments that it considers appropriate 
borrowings under repurchase agreements increased by million to billion at december   from billion at december  this increase in leverage was facilitated by the increase in the company s equity capital as a result of the issuance of common stock primarily through public offerings during at december   repurchase agreements had a weighted average borrowing rate of  on loan balances of between  and million 
these agreements generally have original terms to maturity ranging from one to months at inception of the loan and fixed interest rates that are typically based off of libor 
to date  the company has not had any margin calls on its repurchase agreements that it was unable to satisfy with either cash or additional pledged collateral 
during the year ended december   principal payments on mbs generated cash of billion and operations provided million in cash 
as part of its core investing activities  during the  the company acquired billion of mbs  all of which were either agency mbs or aaa rated arm mbs 
other uses of funds during the year ended december   included payments of million for dividends on the company s outstanding common stock and ders 
during the year ended december   the company sold mbs with an aggregate carrying value of million  realizing net losses of  and generating cash proceeds of million 
although the company typically intends to hold its investments in mbs for investment purposes  sales may occur as part of the company s overall asset liability management in response to various market conditions and opportunities 
as such  all of the company s mbs are designated as available for sale 
on june   the company filed a shelf registration statement on form s with the sec under the act with respect to an aggregate of million of common stock and or preferred stock that may be sold by the company from time to time pursuant to rule under the act 
on july   the sec declared this registration statement effective 
at december  the company had million available under this shelf registration statement 
on september   the company filed a shelf registration statement on form s with the sec under the act with respect to an aggregate of million of common stock and or preferred stock that may be sold by the company from time to time pursuant to rule under the act 
on october   the sec declared this registration statement effective 
at december   the company had million of available under this shelf registration statement 
during the year ended december   the company completed two public offerings of its common stock  as detailed below  in which it issued an aggregate of approximately million shares and raised net proceeds of million 
the company s equity offerings were as follows number of offering settlement date shares price per share gross proceeds expenses net proceeds in thousands  except share and per share amounts may      august      august     includes the exercise of the underwriters over allotment option in full 
represents the exercise of the underwriters over allotment option in full on the august  transaction 
the company has an aggregate of million remaining under its two effective shelf registration statements 
to the extent the company raises additional equity capital from future capital market transactions  the company currently anticipates using the net proceeds for general corporate purposes  including  without limitation  the acquisition of additional mbs consistent with its investment policy and the repayment of its repurchase agreements 
the company may also consider acquiring additional interests in multi family apartment properties and or other investments consistent with its investment strategies and operating policies 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will be able to raise additional equity capital at any particular time or on any particular terms 
on december   the company filed a shelf registration statement on form s with the sec for the purpose of registering common stock for sale through the drspp 
this registration statement was declared effective by the sec on december  and  when combined with the unused portion of the company s previous drspp shelf registration statement  registered an aggregate of million shares of common stock 
as of december   the company had issued million shares of common stock to participants in the drspp and received net proceeds of million 
in order to reduce interest rate risk exposure on a portion of the company s libor based repurchase agreements  the company had during purchased interest rate cap agreements  having a notional amount of million  for an aggregate cost of million 
see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
to date  the company has not received any payments related to its cap agreements  as market interest rates were below the cap agreements strike rates for in its entirety 
although no cap agreements were entered into during  additional purchases of cap agreements may be made during cap agreements generate future cash if interest rates increase beyond the rate specified in the individual agreement 
under its repurchase agreements  the company may be required to pledge additional assets to its repurchase agreement counterparties ie  lenders in the event the estimated fair value of the existing pledged collateral under such agreements declines and such lenders demand additional collateral a margin call  which may take the form of additional securities or cash 
specifically  margin calls result from a decline in the value of the company s mbs securing its repurchase agreements  generally due to principal reduction of such mbs from scheduled amortization and prepayments on the mortgages securing such mbs and to changes in the estimated fair value of such mbs resulting from changes in market interest rates and other market factors 
the company s restricted cash balance represents cash held on deposit as collateral with lenders and  at the time a repurchase agreement rolls ie  matures  generally will be applied against the repurchase agreement  thereby reducing the borrowing 
the company believes it has adequate financial resources to meet its obligations as they come due  including margin calls  and to fund dividends declared as well as to actively pursue its investment strategies 
through december   the company did not have any margin calls on its repurchase agreements that it was not able to satisfy with either cash or additional pledged collateral 
however  should prepayment speeds on the mortgages underlying the company s mbs and or market interest rates suddenly increase  margin calls on the company s repurchase agreements could result  causing an adverse change in the company s liquidity position 
the following table summarized the effect on the company s liquidity and cash flows from contractual obligations for repurchase agreements and the non cancelable office lease at december  thereafter repurchase agreements    long term lease obligation  inflation substantially all of the company s assets and liabilities are financial in nature 
as a result  changes in interest rates and other factors impact our performance far more than does inflation 
our financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap and our dividends are based upon net income as calculated for tax purposes  in each case  our activities and balance sheet are measured with reference to historical cost or estimated fair value without considering inflation 
other matters the company intends to conduct its business so as to maintain its exempt status under  and not to become regulated as an investment company for purposes of  the investment company act 
if the company failed to maintain its exempt status under the investment company act and became regulated as an investment company  the company s ability to  among other things  use leverage would be substantially reduced and  as a result  the company would be unable to conduct its business as described in this annual report on form k 
the investment company act exempts entities that are primarily engaged in the business of purchasing or otherwise acquiring mortgages and other liens on and interests in real estate qualifying interests 
under the current interpretation of the staff of the sec  in order to qualify for this exemption  the company must maintain at least of its assets directly in qualifying interests the test 
mbs that do not represent all of the certificates issued ie  an undivided interest with respect to the entire pool of mortgages ie  a whole pool underlying such mbs may be treated as securities separate from such underlying mortgage loans and  thus  may not be considered qualifying interests for purposes of the test 
therefore  the company s ownership of these types of mbs is limited by the provisions of the investment company act 
in meeting the test  the company treats as qualifying interests those mbs issued with respect to an underlying pool as to which it owns all of the issued certificates 
if the sec or its staff adopts a contrary interpretation  the company could be required to sell a substantial amount of its mbs under potentially adverse market conditions 
further  in order to insure that it at all times qualifies for this exemption from the investment company act  the company may be precluded from acquiring mbs whose yield is somewhat higher than the yield on mbs that could be otherwise purchased in a manner consistent with this exemption 
accordingly  the company monitors its compliance with the test in order to maintain its exempt status under the investment company act 
as of december   the company had determined that it was in and had maintained compliance with the test

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company seeks to manage the interest rate  market value  liquidity  prepayment and credit risks inherent in all financial institutions in a prudent manner designed to insure the longevity of the company while  at the same time  seeking to provide an opportunity to stockholders to realize attractive total rates of return through stock ownership of the company 
while the company does not seek to avoid risk  it does seek  to the best of its ability  to assume risk that can be quantified from historical experience  to actively manage such risk  to earn sufficient returns to justify the taking of such risks and to maintain capital levels consistent with the risks that it does undertake 
interest rate risk the company primarily invests in arm mbs  which include hybrid mbs  which have interest rates that are fixed for a specified period and  thereafter  generally reset annually 
as of december   applying a cpr  the weighted average term to repricing or prepayment of the company s arm mbs portfolio was months and the weighted average term to repricing on repurchase agreements was months  resulting in repricing gap of months 
the cpr is applied in order to reflect  to a certain extent  the prepayment characteristics inherent in the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
as of december   based on contractual terms ie  assuming no prepayments  the company s arm mbs portfolio had a weighted average term to repricing of months and repurchase agreements had a weighted average term to repricing of months  resulting in a month contractual repricing gap 
the company s debt obligations are generally repurchase agreements with terms of three years or less 
upon contractual maturity or an interest reset date  these borrowings are refinanced at then prevailing market rates 
the interest rates for most of the company s adjustable rate assets are primarily dependent on the libor and one year cmt rate  while debt obligations  in the form of repurchase agreements  are generally dependent on libor 
while the libor and cmt generally move together  there can be no assurance that such movements will be parallel  such that the magnitude of the movement of one index will match that of the other index 
at december   the company had of its arm mbs portfolio repricing from the one year cmt index  repricing from the one year libor index  repricing from cofi and repricing from the month cmt moving average 
the company s adjustable rate investment assets and borrowings ie  repurchase agreements reset on various dates that differ for the specific asset or obligation 
in general  the repricing of the company s debt obligations occurs more quickly than the repricing of assets 
therefore  on average  the company s cost of borrowings may rise or fall more quickly than does its earnings rate on the assets 
the mismatch between repricings or maturities within a time period is commonly referred to as the gap for that period 
a positive gap asset sensitive  where interest rate sensitive assets exceed interest rate sensitive liabilities  generally will result in the net interest margin increasing in a rising interest rate environment and decreasing in a falling interest rate environment 
a negative gap liability sensitive will generally have the opposite results on the net interest margin 
as discussed above  the gap analysis is prepared assuming a cpr  however  actual prepayment speeds could vary significantly from the rate assumed in the table 
the gap analysis does not reflect the constraints on the repricing of arm mbs in a given period resulting from periodic and lifetime cap features on these securities  or the behavior of various indexes applicable to the company s assets and liabilities 
the gap methodology does not assess the relative sensitivity of assets and liabilities to changes in interest rates and also fails to account for interest rate caps and floors imbedded in the company s mbs or include assets and liabilities that are not interest rate sensitive or the company s hedging instruments 
the following table presents the company s interest rate risk using the gap methodology at december  at december  less than three months one year to two years to beyond three in thousands three months to one year two years year three years total interest earning assets arm mbs       fixed rate mbs   cash   total interest earning assets       interest bearing liabilities repurchase agreements      total interest bearing liabilities      interest sensitivity gap       cumulative interest sensitivity gap      to a limited extent  the company uses cap agreements as part of its interest rate risk management 
the notional amounts of these instruments are not reflected in the company s balance sheet 
the cap agreements  which hedge against increases in interest rates on the company s libor based repurchase agreements  are not considered in the gap analysis  as they do not effect the timing of the repricing of the instruments they hedge  but rather to the extent of the notional amount  cap the limit on the amount of interest rate change that can occur relative to the hedged liability 
the company s cap agreements  at the time of purchase  are intended to serve as a hedge against future interest rate increases on the company s repurchase agreements  which are typically priced off of libor 
as of december   the company had million of notional amount of cap agreements  with a weighted average strike rate for the one month libor of 
market value risk substantially all of the company s investment securities are designated as available for sale assets 
as such  they are reflected at their estimated fair value  with the difference between amortized cost and estimated fair value reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income  a component of stockholders equity 
see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  included under item the estimated fair value of the company s mbs fluctuate primarily due to changes in interest rates and other factors  however  given that these securities are issued or guaranteed as to principal or interest by an agency of the us government or a federally chartered corporation or are aaa rated  such fluctuations are generally not based on the creditworthiness of the mortgages securing such mbs 
generally  in a rising interest rate environment  the estimated fair value of the company s mbs would be expected to decrease  conversely  in a decreasing interest rate environment  the estimated fair value of such mbs would be expected to increase 
if the estimated fair value of the company s mbs decreases  the company may receive margin calls from its repurchase agreement counterparties due to such a decline in the estimated fair value of the mbs collateralizing repurchase agreements 
liquidity risk the primary liquidity risk for the company arises from financing long maturity assets  which have interim and lifetime interest rate adjustment caps  with debt in the form of repurchase agreements 
although the interest rate adjustments of these assets and liabilities are matched within the guidelines established by the company s operating policies  maturities are not required to be  nor are they matched 
the company s assets which are pledged to secure repurchase agreements are high quality  liquid assets 
as a result  the company has not had difficulty rolling over ie  renewing these agreements as they mature 
however  there can be no assurances that the company will always be able to roll over its repurchase agreements 
at december   the company had cash and cash equivalents of million available to meet margin calls on its repurchase agreements and for other corporate purposes 
however  should prepayment speeds on the mortgages underlying the company s mbs and or market interest rates suddenly increase  margin calls on the company s repurchase agreements could result  causing an adverse change in the company s liquidity position 
prepayment and reinvestment risk as the company receives repayments of principal on its mbs  premiums paid on such securities are amortized against interest income and discounts on mbs are accreted to interest income 
premiums arise when the company acquires a mbs at a price in excess of the principal balance of the mortgages securing such mbs or the par value of such mbs if purchased at the original issue 
conversely  discounts arise when the company acquires a mbs at a price below the principal balance of the mortgages securing such mbs  or the par value of such mbs  if purchased at the original issue 
for financial accounting purposes interest income is accrued based on the outstanding principal balance of the investment securities and their contractual terms 
purchase premiums on the company s investment securities  currently comprised of mbs  are amortized against interest income over the lives of the securities using the effective yield method  adjusted for actual prepayment activity 
in general  an increase in the prepayment rate  as measure by the cpr  will accelerate the amortization of purchase premiums  thereby reducing the yield interest income earned on such assets 
for tax accounting purposes  the purchase premiums are amortized based on the constant effective yield at the purchase date 
therefore  on a tax basis  amortization of premiums will differ from those reported for financial purposes under gaap 
at december   the gross unamortized premium for arm mbs for financial accounting purposes was million of the carrying value of mbs while the gross unamortized premium for federal tax purposes was estimated at million 
in general  the company believes that it will be able to reinvest proceeds from scheduled principal payments and prepayments at acceptable yields  however  no assurances can be given that  should significant prepayments occur  market conditions would be such that acceptable investments could be identified and the proceeds timely reinvested 
tabular presentation the information presented in the following table projects the potential impact of sudden parallel changes in interest rates on projected net interest income and portfolio value based on the investments in the company s portfolio on december  and includes the company s interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
the company acquires interest rate sensitive assets and funds them with interest rate sensitive liabilities 
the company generally plans to retain such assets and the associated interest rate risk to maturity 
change in percentage change percentage change interest rates in net interest income in portfolio value many assumptions are made to present the information in the above table  as such  there can be no assurance that assumed events will occur or that other events will not occur that would affect the outcomes  therefore  the above table and all related disclosure constitutes forward looking statements 
the analysis presented utilizes assumptions and estimates based on management s judgment and experience 
furthermore  future sales  acquisitions and restructuring could materially change the company s interest rate risk profile 
the table quantifies the potential changes in net interest income and portfolio value should interest rates immediately change shock 
the table presents the estimated impact of interest rates instantaneously rising and basis points  and falling and basis points 
the cash flows associated with the portfolio of mbs for each rate shock are calculated based on a assumptions  including  but not limited to  prepayment speeds  yield on future acquisitions  slope of the yield curve  and size of the portfolio 
assumptions made on the interest rate sensitive liabilities  which are repurchase agreements  include anticipated interest rates  collateral requirements as a percent of the repurchase agreement and amount of borrowing 
the impact on portfolio value is approximated using the calculated effective duration of and expected convexity of 
impact on net interest income is driven mainly by the difference between portfolio yield and cost of funding 
the company s asset liability structure is generally such that a decrease in interest rates would be expected to result in an increase to net interest income  as the company s repurchase agreements are generally shorter term than the company s interest earning assets 
when interest rates are shocked  prepayment assumptions are adjusted based on management s expectation along with the results from the prepayment model 
for example  under current market conditions  a basis point increase in interest rates is estimated to result in a decrease in the cpr of the mbs portfolio 
the base interest rate scenario assumes interest rates at december  actual results could differ significantly from those estimated in the table
