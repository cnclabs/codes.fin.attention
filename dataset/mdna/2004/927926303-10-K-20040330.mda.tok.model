overview vista gold is engaged in the evaluation  acquisition  exploration and advancement of gold exploration and potential development projects with the aim of adding value to the projects 
the corporation s approach to acquisitions of gold projects has generally been to seek projects within political jurisdictions with well established mining  land ownership and tax laws  which have adequate drilling and geological data to support the completion of a third party review of the geological data and to complete an estimate of the mineralized material 
in addition  the corporation looks for opportunities to improve the value of its gold projects through exploration drilling or introducing technological innovations 
the corporation expects that emphasis on gold project acquisition and improvement will continue in the future 
the corporation currently owns or controls eleven gold properties the maverick springs  mountain view  hasbrouck  three hills and wildcat projects and the hycroft mine  all in nevada  the long valley project in east central california  the yellow pine project in idaho  the paredones amarillos and the guadalupe de los reyes projects in mexico  and the amayapampa project in bolivia 
the corporation also owns several exploration claims in canada and approximately of the shares of zamora gold corp  a company exploring for gold in ecuador 
the corporation s significant activities during include the corporation acquiring interests in six gold properties through purchases or option to purchase agreements  posting letters of credit for million with the us bureau of land management  nevada state office  to cover increases in the reclamation bonding at the hycroft mine for revised reclamation costs  and completion of a drilling program for the maverick springs project in october indicating further expansion of gold silver mineralization 
in december  the corporation  through its hrdi subsidiary  signed a letter of intent to provide a new bond package for the hycroft mine to include an insurance component and cover all existing reclamation liability at the hycroft mine 
in february  a private placement for million was completed with shareholder approval  providing net proceeds of million 
an option agreement to sell the amayapampa gold project was entered into in december with a due diligence period expiring on june  outlook gold prices started at per ounce and finished the year at per ounce 
management believes that this trend will continue for several years to come and as a result  the properties that are owned and controlled by the corporation which contain mineralized material could gain in value 
however  there is no assurance that gold prices will continue to rise see part i item  business risk factors the price of gold is subject to fluctuations at the end of  the corporation owned or controlled five properties containing mineralized material 
at the end of  six new properties had been added through the use of funds raised through private placements and the exercise of warrants 
the corporation expects that emphasis on gold project acquisition will continue in the future 
in addition  through exploration drilling and engineering studies  management believes that additional value can be added to most of the projects by advancing them closer to a production decision 
the corporation does not currently generate operating cash flows 
subject to sustained gold prices  management expects to generate revenues and cash flows in the future 
the corporation may generate revenues and cash flows from its portfolio of gold projects by several means  including but not limited to options or leases to third parties  joint venture arrangements with other gold producers  outright sales for cash and or royalties  or project development and operation 
the corporation s working capital of million at december   is not sufficient to cover the total cash requirements of million which includes the million for bond payments for hycroft and million for general operations  exploration activities and land holding costs 
this raises substantial doubt with respect to the corporation s ability to continue as a going concern 
subsequent to year end  warrants have been exercised which reduced the expected shortfall  and there are still outstanding warrants that  if exercised  would provide proceeds aggregating approximately million for the corporation 
there are  however  no assurances that the balance of the warrants will be exercised during and the corporation may find it necessary to raise additional funds through private placements 
while the corporation has been successful in raising money by private placements in the past  there are no guarantees that the corporation will be successful in the future 
management believes  however  that absent sufficient funding through warrant exercises or a private placement  sale or joint venture of one or more of the corporation s current projects will generate sufficient revenue to cover any shortfall in with respect to the corporation s current property holdings  aggregate expenditures for purchase installments  to maintain options and conduct exploration activities are currently anticipated to be approximately  in and  in at present  the corporation would anticipate raising funds to meet these long term obligations through equity private placements  or joint venture efforts or sale of properties currently controlled 
in subsequent years  the corporation anticipates that it will need to raise additional capital to meet property purchase installment obligations and scheduled payments on those properties that the corporation decides to retain under option 
further  additional capital would be necessary to acquire properties and conduct exploration drilling and re engineering studies on current and newly acquired properties 
however  there can be no assurance that the corporation will be successful in efforts to raise additional capital 
results from operations summary the corporation s consolidated net loss was million or per share compared to the consolidated net loss of million or per share for a net decrease of million 
the improvement of million in includes a non recurring charge of million for a reclamation obligation increase  offset by increased holding costs at the hycroft mine of million  increased holding costs at the amayapampa property of million  increased general and administrative costs of million  increased investor relations costs of million  and increased depreciation of million 
as compared to a consolidated net loss of million or per share in  the consolidated net loss decreased by million 
the improvement in is a result of reduced holding costs at the hycroft mine of million  lower depreciation and amortization costs of million  and a non recurring charge of million for settlement of a lawsuit  net of related million cost recoveries in  offset by a million expense to increase the provision for reclamation at hycroft  and a million increase in general and administrative expenses 
gold production and revenue the hycroft mine is on care and maintenance 
mining activities were suspended at hycroft in and  as expected  gold production has declined steadily since that time 
currently  solution is being circulated over the heap leach pads to enhance evaporation and extract gold through carbon stripping processes 
the extracted gold is then refined and sold 
effective at the beginning of fiscal  gold production was considered incidental to the activities at the hycroft mine and reporting the associated sales proceeds as revenue was no longer warranted 
accordingly  gold sales proceeds of approximately million in and million in have been accounted for as an offset to exploration  property evaluation and holding costs 
gold revenues in and therefore were nil  compared to million in the gold revenues were a result of  ounces of gold production 
as discussed above  effective at the beginning of fiscal  gold production was considered incidental to the activities at the hycroft mine 
accordingly  gold production costs  which are offset by proceeds received from gold sales of million in and million in  are no longer recorded as production costs  but are accounted for as exploration  property evaluation and holding costs 
recorded and production costs are therefore nil 
exploration  property evaluation and holding costs exploration  property evaluation and holding costs increased approximately million from million in to million in the increase in net holding costs for the hycroft mine of approximately million primarily contributes to the overall increase noted 
actual holding costs for the hycroft mine did not in fact increase from the prior year  but rather  gold recovery from the heap leach pads decreased from resulting in the net increase in costs 
holding costs for the amayapampa project increased during by approximately million with the addition of legal  accounting and land services not provided in  as well as the absence of offsetting royalties collected in from the sale of the capa circa mine occurring in the sale agreement for capa circa calls for a continued royalty payment which is not being honored by new management at the mine 
the corporation is taking the necessary steps to try and rectify this situation 
corporate administration and investor relations corporate administrative and investor relations costs were million in compared to million in  representing an increase of million 
this increase is the result of a more comprehensive investor relations program  the cost of which increased million from  and a million increase in general expenses and payroll costs with the addition of personnel and the use of consultants during the year 
management believes these additional personnel and consultants played a significant role in the acquisition of properties that occurred in corporate administration and investor relations costs were million in  slightly higher than the million in the increase reflects new investor relations and business development programs  consistent with the increased level of gold project acquisition and private placement financings in depreciation  depletion and amortization depreciation  depletion and amortization increased in by approximately million to million in from million in this increase is primarily the result of plant and equipment at the hycroft mine being depreciated in over the full year where depreciation was not calculated as a result of write downs to salvage value in prior years 
depreciation  depletion and amortization costs at hycroft were million in compared to million in this decrease is because a significant portion of the hycroft property  plant and equipment has been sold and a substantial portion of the remaining equipment has been fully depreciated 
other income and expenses provisions for reclamation and mine closure costs during  the corporation increased its accrued mine closure costs by  for employee severance accruals 
with consideration given to this increase  the accrued reclamation obligation and mine closure costs at year end was million as compared to million in as previously noted  the corporation has adopted the new accounting standard for asset retirement obligations  cica management regularly reviews the fair value of reclamation obligation estimates where any increase in the fair value of the estimate will be recorded in the period in which the increase is incurred 
the application of this standard did not result in an increase in the reclamation obligations during the year consistent with the us bureau of land management  nevada state office mandated procedures in  the corporation commissioned a third party comprehensive review of the estimated reclamation costs at the hycroft mine 
based on this review  the corporation increased its accrued reclamation obligation by million in to million from million 
no such adjustments were made in provision for settlement and cost recoveries related to usf g lawsuit in  the corporation recorded a non recurring provision of million for the settlement of the usf g lawsuit 
subsequently  the corporation settled the lawsuit for approximately  less than provisioned 
further related to the settlement  the corporation received marketable securities valued at approximately  million at the time of receipt 
there were no similar provisions or recoveries in or stock based compensation during  the corporation granted  stock options to non employees valued at  compared to  options granted to non employees in valued at  the corporation valued the granted options in both and using the black scholes model 
the corporation did not grant stock options to non employees during gain on disposal of marketable securities gain on disposal of marketable securities increased in as  in gains were realized in compared to no realized gain during the same period in no gains were realized in  either 
in  the corporation received  common shares of golden phoenix minerals  inc gpmi in consideration for benefits gpmi received as a direct result of the corporation s facilitation of the usf g settlement noted above 
these shares had a fair market value of  when received 
an  write down to fair value was made to reflect an estimated  fair market value of the gpmi shares at december  in march of  a  write down to fair market value was made to reflect an estimated  fair market value of the gpmi shares 
during the remainder of  the corporation liquidated the  shares of gpmi resulting in a gain of  additionally  the corporation obtained  common shares of esperanza minerals esperanza valued at  in february as of december   the corporation held  of the esperanza shares with a book value of  a gain of  on the sale of  esperanza shares was realized in in aggregate  the corporation realized gains on the sale of marketable securities during of  no similar gains were realized in or at december   the corporation held marketable securities available for sale with a book value of  the corporation purchased the securities for investing purposes with the intent to hold the securities until such time that it would be advantageous to sell the securities at a gain 
although there can be no reasonable assurance that a gain will be realized from the sale of the securities  the corporation monitors the market status of the securities consistently in order to mitigate the risk of loss on the investment 
gain on disposal of assets no net gains or losses on the disposal of assets were recorded in as compared to a net gain of  in net gains from disposals of assets in included a gain of  from the disposal of canadian exploration claims and gains from sales of hycroft equipment totaling net gains on disposal of assets for totaled million compared to net gains of million in loss on foreign currency translation foreign currency translation losses occurring in and were reclassified to corporate administration costs as the amounts were negligible and are not reflected separately in the corresponding statements of loss reported by the corporation in loss on foreign currency translation for the year totaled  compared to  in the increase of  is related to exchange differences realized between property obligation accruals in and related payments in these transactions include the accrual of a cdn  liability for the purchase of the paredones amarillos project in and the subsequent payment of the liability in resulting in a transactional loss of  the foreign currency loss in was  as compared to  in the comparative difference of  is in direct relation to increased foreign exchange volume during the year and is not attributed to any one significant transaction 
other income and expense during  the corporation incurred no interest expense as it had no commercial debt during the corporation incurred  in interest expense in in connection with its convertible debenture issuance  which closed on march  the debentures had an annual interest rate of and were converted automatically  pursuant to their terms  on september  interest expense of  in related to debt was higher than the  incurred in during  the corporation accumulated  in interest income from investing within a liquid savings account as compared to  in this difference is attributed to additional cash of approximately million being raised from the completed private placement in february  the residual exercise of warrants related to the and private placements and the exercise of stock options 
financial position  liquidity and capital resources cash used in operations cash used in operations was million in compared to cash uses of million in and million in the increase of million in from can be attributed to the addition of one employee  administrative costs  property acquisitions and professional fees incurred during the year related to the completed private placement 
the increase of million in from is primarily the result of repayment of debt in of million 
the remainder of the cash improvement reflects the corporation s successful cost reduction efforts  offset by a reduction in gold revenues 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities in was million compared to million in and cash provided in of million from the sale of equipment 
cash used for property expenditures was million in compared to million in and nil in cash property expenditures for included the acquisition costs of  for the maverick springs  long valley  wildcat  hasbrouck  three hills  yellow pine and guadalupe de los reyes projects 
options payments contributed  to the cash usage along with  for exploration and land holding costs 
these cash expenditures are offset by cost recoveries during of  pursuant to the maverick springs gold silver joint venture and option payments received from a third party for the potential acquisition of amayapampa 
proceeds from the disposal of fixed assets and supplies were nil in  million in and million in the corporation raised million from the sale of hycroft mining equipment and canadian mining claims in as compared to million from the sale of idle mining equipment at the hycroft mine in other cash usages in consisted of plant and equipment acquisitions of  for mobile equipment at the hycroft mine and computer hardware and software purchases for the corporate offices 
during and  no expenditures for additions to plant and equipment occurred 
in  the corporation invested  for the acquisition of marketable securities and received proceeds of  from related sales of marketable securities acquired in prior years 
there were no investing activities related to marketable securities in or in addition  million cash was set aside in a restricted account for increased bond requirements at hycroft in  which was not required in or financing activities the corporation received net cash from financing activities of million in compared to million in and a net cash use of million in cash provided by financing activities in includes a net of million from private placements  million from the exercise of warrants and million from the exercise of options 
the corporation completed a million private placement financing in february consisting of  special warrants  each priced at 
the special warrants were automatically converted into equity units upon shareholder approval  which occurred in february each equity unit consisted of one common share and one warrant see note 
these gross proceeds were offset by a cash finder s commission totaling  paid in connection with the private placement and direct costs connected with this private placement of  net proceeds of million from the february private placement were million less than the february and december private placements completed in the prior year which together netted million 
warrants exercised during produced cash proceeds of million compared to million in during  million in cash proceeds were from the february private placement warrants  million was from the february private placement warrants and million was from the december private placement warrants 
during  warrants exercised from the february private placement provided million in cash proceeds 
the exercise of stock options produced cash of  during as compared to  in in  the corporation raised no cash from completed financings  warrant exercises or stock option exercises 
during  the corporation used million to repay debt in financing activities 
liquidity and capital resources at december   the corporation s total assets were million as compared to million and million for and  respectively 
long term liabilities as of december  totaled million as compared to million in and million in at the same date in  the corporation had working capital of million compared to million in and a deficit of current assets to current liabilities of million in the corporation s working capital of million as of december   increased from by million as compared to an increase from to of million 
the principal component of working capital for both and is cash and cash equivalents of million and million  respectively 
other components include marketable securities   accounts receivable   and other liquid assets  
the difference of million in working capital from to relates to cash proceeds received from the exercise of warrants in december and a receivable of approximately  outstanding at year end at december   the corporation held no debt with banks or financial institutions and had a future liability of  due in for the purchase of the hasbrouck and three hills projects 
remaining amounts for liabilities at year end are related to trade and corporate administration 
payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years after years us s long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases purchase obligations other long term obligations total contractual obligations major cash commitments in are related to corporate administration and operations of approximately million  property options and expenditure commitments of approximately million  and bonding package cash requirements of million for an aggregate cash usage of approximately million 
however  the total bonding package requirements will be offset by cash currently classified as restricted in the amount of million reducing the cash requirements to million 
although the corporation maintains a strong working capital position  the corporation does not have sufficient working capital to satisfy cash requirements of million for fiscal commitments 
current timing of commitments indicates the corporation will be able to satisfy its cash commitments through june the corporation is investigating the possibility of raising additional capital through private placements and although management has been successful in the past  there can be no assurance that it will be able to raise additional capital in the future 
the corporation continues to actively pursue options to monetize its assets and attract other investors 
as of december   warrants outstanding to purchase common shares of the corporation totaled  with a weighted average exercise price of and potential gross proceeds of million 
although the corporation has received significant cash proceeds from the exercise of warrants issued in private placements  there can be no assurance that cash proceeds from the exercise of warrants will be received in the future to offset the working capital shortfall 
through february   however  the corporation has received additional cash proceeds totaling  these proceeds are made up of  from the exercise of warrants  and a cash payment of  for a receivable recorded at year end

in addition  the corporation agreed to pay reasonable legal costs incurred by global in connection with the special warrant offering up to a maximum of  the corporation understands that all of the shares of global are beneficially owned by an individual that beneficially owned approximately of the common shares of the corporation as at february  maverick springs in june  the corporation formalized an agreement to grant to silver standard resources inc  ssri an option to acquire the corporation s interest in the silver mineralized material hosted in the maverick springs project in nevada 
the corporation and ssri have a common director 
under the terms of the agreement  the corporation will retain its interest in the gold mineralized material  ssri will pay the corporation million over four years including a cash payment of  at closing 
the remaining million will be used by the corporation to fund exploration programs  land holding costs and option payments on the maverick springs project 
at the time the transaction was completed  ssri paid the corporation  comprised of the required  payment due at closing plus  in exploration costs incurred through december  as of december   included in current assets is a receivable amount due from ssri in the amount of  nil to reimburse the corporation for exploration expenditures incurred on the maverick springs project 
subsequent events agreement for new bond for hycroft in december  the corporation s wholly owned subsidiary  hycroft resources development  inc hrdi reached an agreement in principle with member companies of american international group  inc to replace the existing bond coverage for the hycroft mine with a new bond package which includes an insurance component and covers all existing reclamation liability at the hycroft mine 
on january   the final bond package agreement was executed 
the new bond package calls for an initial payment of million and two additional payments of million each due july   and december   respectively 
the corporation has remitted payment of million and assigned letters of credit for million to be applied to the initial payment amount 
pending approval of the new bonding instrument by the us bureau of land management  nevada state office  blm  the new insurance bonding instrument will replace the existing bond made up of a million non cash collaterized bond from american home assurance company  letters of credit of million posted directly with the blm and the existing indemnity agreement between hrdi and the corporation 
agreement to sell amayapampa in december  the corporation reached an agreement with luzon minerals ltd 
luzon to sell the amayapampa project in bolivia 
completion of the transaction is subject to the receipt of all regulatory and other approvals  and completion of due diligence satisfactory to luzon by june  during this due diligence period  luzon has agreed to update the feasibility study  complete a technical report  and seek the required financing for the project 
luzon issued the corporation  common shares initially  and during the due diligence period  luzon will pay the corporation  per month for the first four months  then  per month for the fifth and sixth months 
at completion of the due diligence period  provided luzon elects to proceed  luzon will pay the corporation  and issue the corporation  common shares 
at the earlier of start of construction or january   luzon will pay the corporation  or at the corporation s election  a combination of shares and cash based on luzon s share price  not to exceed  shares or  cash 
luzon will grant the corporation a net smelter returns royalty where the price of gold is less than per ounce and a net smelter returns royalty where the price of gold is per ounce or more 
the corporation has completed a carrying value analysis for the amayapampa project as it relates to the agreement reached with luzon 
the fair value of the amayapampa property has been evaluated through a discounted future cash flow methodology 
the methodology required the use of feasibility studies completed in and  terms from the recent option to purchase agreement  assumptions for probable outcomes derived from the option to purchase agreement and estimates and assumptions for future gold prices 
the results of the carrying value assessment for the amayapampa project under the assumptions and estimates noted above led to the determination that no impairment to the current carrying value has occurred 
significant accounting policies and changes in accounting policies use of estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
significant areas requiring the use of estimates include mine closure and reclamation obligations  useful lives for asset depreciation purposes  and impairment of mineral properties 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
mineral properties mineral property acquisition costs and exploration and development expenditures are recorded at cost and are deferred until the viability of the property is determined 
general overhead  administrative and holding costs to maintain a property on a care and maintenance basis are expensed in the period they are incurred 
if a project would be put into production  capitalized costs would be depleted on the unit of production basis 
option payments and reimbursements received are treated as a recovery of mineral property costs 
option payments are at the discretion of the optionee and accordingly are accounted for on a cash basis or when receipt is reasonably assured 
management of the corporation regularly reviews the net carrying value of each mineral property 
where information and conditions suggest impairment  estimated future cash flows are calculated using estimated future prices  proven and probable reserves  weighted probable outcomes and operating capital and reclamation costs on an undiscounted basis 
a reduction in the carrying value of each property would be recorded if the net book value exceeds the estimated future cash flows 
where estimates of future net cash flows are not available and where other conditions suggest impairment  management assesses if carrying values can be recovered 
provision for future reclamation and closure costs on january   the corporation adopted the new accounting standard for asset retirement obligations  cica the standard requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset 
the adoption of this standard did not have any impact on the corporation s financial position or results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the corporation is engaged in the acquisition of gold projects and related activities including exploration engineering  permitting and the preparation of feasibility studies 
the value of the corporation s properties is related to gold price and changes in the price of gold could affect the corporation s ability to generate revenue from its portfolio of gold projects 
gold prices may fluctuate widely from time to time and are affected by numerous factors  including the following expectations with respect to the rate of inflation  exchange rates  interest rates  global and regional political and economic circumstances and governmental policies  including those with respect to gold holdings by central banks 
the demand for  and supply of  gold affect gold prices  but not necessarily in the same manner as demand and supply affect the prices of other commodities 
the supply of gold consists of a combination of new mine production and existing stocks of bullion and fabricated gold held by governments  public and private financial institutions  industrial organizations and private individuals 
the demand for gold primarily consists of jewelry and investments 
additionally  hedging activities by producers  consumers  financial institutions and individuals can affect gold supply and demand 
while gold can be readily sold on numerous markets throughout the world  its market value cannot be predicted for any particular time
