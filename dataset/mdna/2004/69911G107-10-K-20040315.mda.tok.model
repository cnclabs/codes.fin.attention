overview we are a leading developer  manufacturer and distributor of broadband network access products for network service providers  commonly referred to as nsps  and business customers 
we operate in a single business segment 
we offer solutions for nsps that utilize existing telephone lines and enable them to offer high speed  cost effective voice  data and video solutions at speeds up to one gigabit per second 
nsps use our broadband products to enable high speed connections from the central office to the customer premise 
moreover  our broadband products enable nsps to more efficiently provide network access services by allowing a high level of management  monitoring and control over network access equipment and circuits 
business customers use our broadband products for high speed connection of voice and data communications to connect their employees to corporate wide area networks and to the internet using both public and private services provided by nsps 
our products are designed for easy installation by nsps and end users  significantly reducing the need for installation by an onsite service technician  thereby reducing costs for network access 
we believe that demand for high speed  broadband transmission will continue to increase as more business and residential users find narrowband access technologies inadequate to meet their high bandwidth requirements 
we strive to meet that demand in the broadband access market by focusing our products on next generation digital subscriber line  or dsl  voice over broadband gateways  service level management  and other broadband access products 
we operate our business through our wholly owned subsidiary  paradyne corporation 
paradyne corporation was originally incorporated in delaware in  acquired by at t in and spun out of at t as part of lucent technologies in in july  a limited partnership controlled by texas pacific group acquired paradyne corporation and formed paradyne acquisition corp 
as a holding company 
paradyne acquisition corp 
changed its name to paradyne networks  inc in june in july and september  paradyne networks  inc issued shares of common stock in the public marketplace through an initial public offering and secondary offering  respectively 

table of contents paradyne has a long history of technological innovation 
as of the end of  we have issued over u 
s 
patents  hold over patents and have over u 
s 
patent applications pending 
our equipment has been sold to over of the fortune companies 
with our reputation and history as a supplier of access solutions to a large customer base  we believe that we are well positioned to provide data  voice and video broadband access solutions to nsps and business customers as they expand and upgrade their networks 
industry background over the past several years  data traffic generated by computer users accessing the internet or business networks has increased significantly 
industry analysts believe that the volume of this data traffic  referred to as wide area network traffic  will continue to expand rapidly due to four key trends the dramatic growth in the use of high bandwidth applications over the internet  such as video and voice  the proliferation of distributed computing applications  such as electronic mail  electronic transaction processing  enterprise resource planning and inter enterprise information transfer based on web technologies  the deregulation of the telecommunications services industry which has increased the number of service providers and intensified competition  and the continued deployment of high capacity fiber optic networks and the emergence of high volume bandwidth network access technologies that increase the ability to transfer large volumes of information 
in order to accommodate increasingly high volumes of data  nsps have invested significant resources to upgrade central office switching centers and the interconnecting infrastructure  known as the network backbone 
while capacity constraints in the network backbone continue to be addressed through the use of high speed digital and fiber optic equipment  the network that connects end users to nsp central offices  typically known as the last mile  remains a bottleneck that limits high speed data transmission 
the last mile was originally constructed with copper twisted pair wiring designed to support analog voice traffic 
there is an estimated installed base of over million copper lines in the united states  and over million worldwide 
end users have been frustrated by these limitations and the ability of nsps to cost effectively deliver high speed services  such as telecommuting  branch office internetworking and internet access  over the last mile 
standard  narrowband dial up connections  which are typically limited to data transmission rates of kilobits per second  or kbps  to kbps do not adequately support these applications 
most business and residential users are finding these types of narrowband access technologies unacceptable for their high bandwidth requirements for voice  video and data services 
global regulatory changes have increased the number of competitors in the access portion of the network and are accelerating the need for nsps to upgrade their networks and increase their service offerings 
internationally  a number of developed and developing nations have privatized their state owned telecommunications monopolies and opened their markets to new nsps 
new competitors in these markets include cable tv operators  internet service providers  satellite operators  fixed wireless operators  and electric utilities 
for example  cable tv operators already provide voice and data services to customers by leveraging the high bandwidth capabilities of their coaxial cable based infrastructure 
this increase in competition for the access portion of the network is also helping to facilitate the transition from narrowband to broadband access over the last mile 
these new international competitors are delivering broadband network access to end user customers for voice  video and data services  which applies significant pressure to the incumbent local exchange carriers  or ilecs  to enhance their network infrastructure and deliver similar broadband services 
new digital technologies have been introduced to increase the speed and quality of digital transmission over the copper wire infrastructure  or local loop  in the last mile and provide alternative means of accessing the network backbone 
the increased speed  lower transmission cost  higher reliability and quality of digital networks are better suited for transmitting the increased level of enhanced voice  video and high speed data traffic that now must pass over the last mile 
nsps continue to aggressively install higher speed  digital broadband transmission technologies  such as dsl  in the last mile 
according to research data compiled by idc  the worldwide number of dsl connections is expected to grow to over million subscribers by based on current market statistics and considering an average price of per line this market growth would require approximately billion in dsl equipment over the next four years 
nsps have deployed various narrowband and broadband technologies across customers wide area networks in order to provide cost effective access solutions for their customers 
demand for high speed access services has increased and more protocols have emerged to facilitate the connections of business customers to nsps network backbones 
protocols are computer languages that allow two or more communications devices  such as modems  to communicate with one another 
these protocols include internet protocol  commonly referred to as ip  frame relay  asynchronous transfer mode  commonly referred to as atm  integrated services digital network  commonly referred to as isdn and others 
when networks must 
table of contents support multiple protocols  network management is more difficult because many protocols are being used simultaneously and the network management devices must decipher each protocol 
the proliferation of protocols makes the provision and management of high speed access technologies and services increasingly difficult 
as a result  nsps are required to operate and maintain hybrid networks comprised of recently adopted new technologies and existing installed equipment 
the performance  quality and maintainability of network services are highly dependent on the volume and type of traffic running over these hybrid networks 
as a result  nsps and business customers need sophisticated diagnostic and management capabilities to monitor business customer application traffic 
the required tools should analyze the physical transmission characteristics as well as enable nsps and business customers to evaluate compliance with service level agreement parameters such as how much data gets through the network  the time it takes data to get through the network  and availability of the network 
business customers also need management solutions that can be scaled to meet growing demand for services  improve network quality  reduce the number of support personnel managing their networks and lower the overall costs for bandwidth and maintenance tools 
as demand for high speed transmission continues to increase  we believe that the telecommunications industry will continue to develop and deploy new broadband access technologies  which will become increasingly cost competitive with traditional technologies 
as a result of changes in the telecommunications industry  nsps are requiring flexible solutions that can be scaled to meet growing demand for voice  video and data services  and also permit easy  cost effective enhancements in the future 
with the increasing number of access protocols and equipment options  customers are placing a higher level of importance on the ability of equipment providers to deliver integrated system solutions 
business objective and strategy our objective is to maintain and build upon our position as one of the leaders in the broadband access market by focusing on several solutions next generation dsl  conventional copper broadband  voice over broadband and service level management 
key elements of our strategy include continue to develop innovative broadband technology and system solutions we will continue to focus on providing innovative  cost effective broadband access solutions that improve communications over the traditional copper telephone wire infrastructure for nsps and business customers 
sales of broadband equipment represented approximately of our total equipment sales revenues for we believe that our internally developed technologies play a key role in differentiating our products from those of our competitors 
we have been issued over u 
s 
patents  hold over patents and have over u 
s 
patent applications pending  and we expect that many of these patents and patent applications will contribute to the development of new technologies and systems 
in addition  we will continue to collaborate with technology partners  in the us and overseas  to facilitate the development of competitive products  as we have previously done with lucent  st microelectronics  texas instruments and others 
our dsl technological innovations include our reachdsl technology  which continues to be further enhanced and brought to market in the form of our reachdsl products 
our reachdsl transceiver technology  which is the core building block of our reachdsl products  has demonstrated superior loop reach  immunity to typical impairments and ease of installation over alternative dsl technologies 
in january  we signed an agreement with alcatel microelectronics a division of alcatel that was subsequently sold to st microelectronics to develop a new adsl chipset that incorporates our reachdsl technology 
if successful  this new adsl chipset  called adsl r  will allow nsps to deploy a single product everywhere without concern for whether the copper lines will fully support adsl technology 
it is anticipated that the adsl r chipset will initially attempt to establish connectivity with adsl  but if it fails to do so  it will establish connectivity with reachdsl  providing the customer with broadband service regardless of the line conditions 
this feature can potentially save the nsp a considerable amount of operational expense  delay and customer frustration 
we believe reachdsl technology will continue to allow us to provide differentiated solutions  both in products and chipset technology  which provide our nsp customers with greater market coverage to more customers and lower installation costs than alternative dsl products 
in february  we offered a new customer premise product that uses adsl r technology  which allows the product to operate with standard adsl technology or  alternatively  with reachdsl technology 
this product represents a large potential benefit to carriers who wish to deploy both standards based adsl for some customers and paradyne s unique reachdsl in the more challenging environments 
this new product will allow the carrier to only have to stock and support a single customer premise product to cover both technologies 
in  we plan to offer an enhanced version of adsl r supporting the latest adsl standards adsl and adsl  allowing the nsp to gain the same operational efficiencies and be able to deploy and support video and voice over ip services 
we expect the product will be available later this year 
with the acquisition of elastic networks in  we obtained a new set of innovative dsl technologies called etherloop 
elastic network s bitstorm product family uses etherloop technology to deliver up to mbps over standard telephone wiring 
elastic networks had found some success in the in building and hospitality hotel dsl markets with their bitstorm 
table of contents products 
we have continued to pursue these markets by expanding the bitstorm product line to support video over dsl and significantly improved the cost effectiveness of hospitality and in building broadband solutions for data and video services 
additionally  paradyne increased the number of nsp partners in the hospitality market  resulting in a substantial increase share of the hospitality and in building services market 
we believe the additional bitstorm products along with the etherloop technology has allowed paradyne to provide differentiated video and data solutions to the emerging in building and hospitality dsl markets 
our slm technology innovations have been implemented in our imarc and openlane products 
we continue to enhance these products with innovations that enable our nsp customers to offer more cost effective slm services more broadly 
we continue to enhance our dsl solutions with products designed for the in building dsl market and more cost effective dsl access multiplexer  or dslam  solutions for deployment of adsl  shdsl and our reachdsl technology 
in order to increase customer premise equipment choices for our customers  we will continue to interoperate with products that allow customers to perform additional  high value functions over their dsl network 
these products allow voice  video and data to share the dsl network  streaming audio and video over a dsl network  or special protocols to be transmitted over a dsl network 
in order to create additional features for our dslams  we continue to develop new versions of both hardware and software to support new requirements from our customers 
further  we have integrated our imarc slm technology into additional platforms  including those that support dsl  ip and atm 
these new slm dsl products will enable service providers to offer higher profit business networking to branch offices and expand their services beyond the commodity internet access markets 
as our customers continue to expand their dsl networks into the application space of conventional broadband networks  we believe our technological leadership and products will provide paradyne with a competitive advantage 
continue to capitalize on global buildout of dsl infrastructure unit sales of dsl equipment  as projected by industry sources  continue to show strong growth 
according to a worldwide analysis by point topic produced in conjunction with the dsl forum  nsps added over million lines of dsl in  more than in total dsl lines increased by over in the second half of the year  reaching million by december   and fueling growth for the year as a whole 
this increase is due to accelerated broadband adoption in a greater number of countries  and dsl winning a larger share of the worldwide market over cable modem offerings 
to capitalize on this projected growth  we intend to continue to pursue design wins from nsps that are offering or plan to offer dsl services 
a design win is achieved when an nsp adopts paradyne products as one of a limited number of dsl platforms for its central office or private network deployment 
a typical nsp build out includes dslams in an nsp s central office  resulting in an installed base into which paradyne will be well positioned to sell dsl line cards for the dslams and dsl customer premises equipment for the end user 
from the third quarter of through the fourth quarter of  paradyne has shipped over  dslams into the marketplace with more than million ports of capacity in the field 
some of our current dsl customers include choice one communications  integra telecom  beijing telecom  dalsviaz russia  cavalier telephone  tds telecom  northern telephone  shanghai telecom  concord telephone  matanuska telephone  broardcom communications  puerto rico telephone company  sprint and verizon 
we will continue to focus on increasing our number of design wins with new nsps  as well as maintain our existing relationships with nsps who have awarded us design wins in the past 
we increased our efforts to penetrate the emerging dsl markets outside of the us in and had success with serbia telecom  cybernet  og vodaphone  and egynet 
these markets represent greater opportunities in and beyond than they have in the past as many countries throughout asia  europe  africa and latin america are starting to deploy broadband dsl networks 
we also intend to continue to produce a variety of dsl line cards and develop or interoperate with innovative dsl customer premises equipment to handle the diverse needs of our nsp customers 
we intend to deliver dsl solutions which improve the profitability of our nsp customers by avoiding the hidden costs associated with many dsl technologies  such as incremental unbudgeted truck rolls  and by providing business grade solutions that will allow our customers to expand their services beyond basic internet access 
in  we expanded our market share within the in building and hospitality markets for high speed access and video over dsl services 
these markets have stabilized and have emerged as requiring support for video on demand  internet access and voice 
the bitstorm product line is able to cost effectivity deliver the bandwidth over short copper loop distances to support applications like these 
in both the in building multiple dwelling unit or mdu market and the hospitality hotels market  demand for services like these offer service providers and building owners attractive business opportunities 
in  we closed significant equipment deals with sprint and several significant nsp partners  focused on the us mdu market  and major hotel chains such as six continents  a hotel holding company with over  hotels around the world  such as inter continental  crowne plaza  holiday inn  holiday inn express and staybridge suites by holiday inn  international hilton group  marriott  and sheraton 
we will continue to focus on increasing our number of design wins with new mdu and hospitality customers  as we believe we are in the position to take advantage of these markets that are in a continued growth phase 

table of contents worldwide deployment of imarc as part of our nsp slm solutions nsps are enhancing their service offerings by providing intelligent devices such as certain of our imarc products that provide nsps with the diagnostic instrumentation to remotely monitor  diagnose and isolate the source of network performance issues 
as a result  nsps are able to provide higher uptime services  with lower costs of operations 
in addition  nsps are offering service level agreements for their frame relay and asynchronous transfer mode business customers 
service level agreements are put in place between an nsp and the nsp s customer to document how the nsp and the customer expect the service to operate 
three parameters are generally measured and documented in these agreements availability ie whether the service connection is up and running  latency delay in traversing the network from end to end and throughput bandwidth used for the customer s connection 
if the service does not operate as specified according to these parameters  then there is typically some type of remedy 
one example of those specified agreements is an agreement that service is to be available hours a day  days a year 
if the service is not available for one of those days  then the nsp may then be required to reimburse the customer for one day s worth of charges 
we believe that as service level agreements become more widely adopted  nsps and end user customers will increasingly require slm solutions and  therefore  nsps will be required to incorporate these solutions in their networks 
we intend to focus on further integrating imarc as part of our existing nsp customers service level agreement solutions and obtaining additional imarc design wins from new nsps 
currently  at t  sbc  broadwing  worldcom  verizon and sprint  telus and bell canada offer imarc solutions to their customers 
in addition  we intend to work with leading frame relay nsps and dsl nsps to deploy lower cost frame relay and virtual private network vpn solutions using our imarc dsl solutions 
these solutions offer dramatic reductions in costs associated with the access networks 
in addition  the frame relay over dsl solutions reduce the frame relay nsps backbone costs by consolidating the number of access lines terminated on a common frame relay switch 
these cost reductions offer increased opportunities to improve margins and increase service rates among the existing frame relay customers 
they also offer the opportunity for nsps to migrate the large number of business applications from lower end alternative services such as isdn  satellite and dial up connections  and expand the addressable market 
focus on product sales to and through nsps we intend to continue focusing on nsps that deploy dsl  frame relay and ip voice  video and data services to capitalize on the increased demand for such services 
over the past five years  our sales to nsps have increased as a result of the efforts of our worldwide nsp direct sales force 
we intend to focus the efforts of our direct sales force on maintaining and increasing sales within our current nsp customer base as well as attracting new nsp customers worldwide 
leverage fortune customer base as they upgrade their networks to broadband we intend to leverage our installed base of fortune companies and other businesses that have purchased our narrowband products and conventional broadband products 
many of these customers have deployed networks including a combination of our narrowband and broadband solutions  and we expect that these companies will continue to upgrade their networks with additional broadband solutions 
we believe that our existing customers prefer to buy our broadband products as a result of the ability to integrate our products into their existing networks more efficiently than the products of our competitors 
products and technologies we develop  manufacture and distribute an extensive line of broadband network access products and technologies 
sales of broadband products represented approximately of our total equipment sales revenue in  approximately in and approximately in in addition  we provide systems that allow business customers and nsps to have a high level of management  monitoring and control over their network access equipment and circuits 
although advanced network management systems are an important aspect of our products and technology  they have not been a material aspect of our sales revenue generation

dsl technology innovation we expect to continue to implement multiple dsl technologies in our products  and  consistent with market requirements  to implement additional dsl technologies as they become available and accepted in the market 
while we purchase some of the dsl technologies implemented in the grandslam and customer premises equipment  our reachdsl product represents a unique dsl technology developed and implemented by us that does not require a telephone line splitter and works over very long loops 
the primary advantages of reachdsl technology are simultaneous voice and data capability over copper loops up to  feet compared with adsl which typically operates up to  feet unaffected by multiple terminations of copper loop  commonly known as bridged taps  which provides for ease of customer installation and eliminates need for rewiring at the customer premise  and its ability to provide high bandwidth service in an impaired copper environment 
the reachdsl product is well suited for line sharing and spectrum unbundling applications as specified by the federal communications commission on december  reachdsl can be operated in line sharing configurations where the dsl service is delivered over the same local line that is delivering basic telephone service 
in addition  reachdsl has demonstrated an ability to operate consistently over a wider range of loop conditions and loop lengths than adsl based products 
we believe reachdsl provides a competitive advantage for competitive local exchange carriers and incumbent carriers in this application 
additionally  we believe reachdsl offers unique capabilities for the incumbent telephone companies in developing countries  where the copper infrastructure is particularly challenging for adsl 
the unique performance characteristics of reachdsl position us well for future business in developing countries around the world 
we expect to continue to implement multiple dsl technologies in our bitstorm products consistent with market demand and new technological innovations 
our bitstorm etherloop product works at high speeds over short loops and at slower  but still broadband speeds over very long loops 
the primary advantages of etherloop technology are service up to megabits over copper loops up to  feet  which enables simultaneous high speed video services in addition to internet access and baseband voice  and

competition the telecommunications market is highly competitive 
if we fail to compete effectively  our business will be adversely affected 
we believe that competition may increase substantially as the introduction of new technologies  deployment of broadband networks and potential regulatory changes create new opportunities for established and emerging companies in the industry 
this increase in competition may lead to price reductions of many of our products 
we compete directly with other providers of broadband and narrowband access equipment  including adtran  alcatel  carrier access corporation  cisco  copper mountain  kentrox  larscom  motorola  nokia  huewei  ut starcom  com  tut systems and visual networks 
we expect that competition for products that address the broadband access market will grow as more companies and an increasing number of new companies focus on this market to develop solutions for higher speed access to public networks 
we expect that competition for products that address the narrowband market will not dramatically change over the course of the next few years 
our future success will depend on our ability to compete successfully against our competitors based on the following factors key product features  system reliability and performance  technological innovation  price  time to market  breadth of product lines  conformity to industry standards  ease of installation and use  brand recognition  technical support and customer service  and size and stability of operations 
research and development since  we have been developing technologies and solutions for the communications market 
we believe that our future success is dependent on our ability to continue to rapidly deliver innovative broadband access solutions 
time to market is critical in order to meet the requirements of our extensive customer base and to be able to quickly adapt to the constantly emerging needs in the market 
innovation is critical in order to provide the capabilities that differentiate the products and solutions that we offer from those of our competitors

intellectual property our success and ability to compete is dependent in part upon our proprietary technology 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws and non disclosure agreements to protect our proprietary technology 
we have been issued over patents  hold over u 
s 
patents and have over u 
s 
patent applications pending 
there can be no assurance that patents will be issued with respect to pending or future patent applications or that our patents will be upheld as valid or will prevent the development of competitive products 
we seek to protect our intellectual property rights by limiting access to the distribution of our software  documentation and other proprietary information 
in addition  our employees execute proprietary information agreements and we enter into nondisclosure agreements with some of our strategic partners 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by us in this regard will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology or that our competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technologies 
we also are subject to the risk of adverse claims and litigation alleging infringement of the intellectual property rights of others 
in this regard  there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims in the future with respect to our current or future products or that any such claims will not require us to enter into license arrangements or result in protracted and costly litigation  regardless of the merits of such claims 
most of paradyne s existing patent portfolio will be enforceable in the united states for at least the next ten years  provided that periodic maintenance fees are paid to the u

manufacturing we manufacture substantially all of our products 
all of our major operations are iso registered 
many of our parts are procured from a variety of qualified suppliers per our specification 
some of our strategic suppliers are electronically linked  and given weeks visibility of demand 
we believe that this is critical in maintaining high delivery volumes and minimizing inventory 
however  because of long lead times for many of our raw materials  we must hold sufficient quantities of all required parts to meet forecasted demand for our products 
we use a combination of standard parts and components  which are generally 
table of contents available from more than one vendor and some parts that are obtained from a single source 
we have generally been able to obtain adequate supplies in a timely manner from our current vendors or  when necessary  to meet production needs from alternative vendors 
we believe that  in most cases  alternate vendors can be identified if current vendors are unable to fulfill our needs 
however  if we are unable to obtain sufficient quantities of necessary supplies  or if there is a significant increase in the price of key components or materials  delays or reductions in manufacturing or product shipments could occur  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we believe that we have sufficient production capacity to meet current demand for our product offerings and anticipate meeting future demand through a combination of the use of additional employees and outsourcing of products or components 
in addition  we have the right of first refusal on the construction of any building on some lands adjacent to our largo  florida facilities if more space is needed to expand our manufacturing operations 
backlog our confirmed backlog at the beginning of each fiscal year is a small portion of the fiscal year s revenue target 
most revenue booked in each quarter results from orders filled within the quarter 
in most circumstances orders  can be rescheduled without penalty 
therefore  backlog is not a meaningful indicator of our future revenues 
employees as of december   we employed approximately full time employees 
none of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements  and we have never experienced a work stoppage  strike or labor dispute 
we believe that our relations with our employees are good 
government regulation from time to time  federal and state legislators propose legislation that could affect our business  either beneficially or adversely  such as by increasing competition or affecting the cost of our operations 
additionally  the federal communications commission and state regulatory bodies may adopt rules  regulations or policies that may affect our business 
we cannot predict the impact of such legislative actions on our operations 
in the united states  the telecommunications act of changed the regulatory environment for all nsps  including the clecs and ilecs among our customer base 
the telecommunications act of removed federal  state and local barriers to entry into the local telephone market by clecs 
the telecommunications act of also imposed significant obligations on ilecs  including obligations to interconnect their networks with competitors networks and to unbundle their networks and provide competitors with access to unbundled network elements 
clecs and ilecs are a significant part of our customer base 
the telecommunications act of also directs the fcc to adopt local loop access rules to enable competitive providers of advanced services  such as high speed internet access  to deploy new technologies on a faster  more cost effective basis to consumers 
the us congress continues to consider possible amendments to the telecommunications act of the fcc continues to consider changes to its regulations  including those relating to network equipment registration and the deployment of broadband services 
from time to time  the fcc or regulatory bodies may propose legislation or adopt rules  regulations or polices that could affect our business  either beneficially or adversely  such as by increasing competition or affecting the cost of our operations 
most recently  the fcc released a ruling on their triennial review of their policies on unbundled network elements 
the ruling provides relief to the ilecs by removing unbundling rules for loops that are comprised of fiber to the home or neighborhood 
they also removed the unbundled network element platform that permitted two clecs to line share voice and data 
also  state public utility commissions were given a larger role in how these rules are applied 
the state commission s new role could benefit either the ilec or clec  depending on the particular state commission 
as we provide products to both ilecs and clecs  this ruling is not expected to significantly impact our revenues 
companies selling terminal equipment to be connected to the public switched telephone network must register some of their products with the fcc and conform them to technical standards promulgated by the fcc in its regulations 
these regulations are designed to protect the public switched telephone network from harm  including interference and service degradation

that action new york securities action alleges that defendants  during the period from july  through december   violated federal securities laws by allocating shares of our initial public offering to favored customers in exchange for their promise to purchase shares in the secondary market at escalating prices 
the new york securities actions seeks damages in an unspecified amount for the purported class for the losses suffered during the class period as a result of an alleged inflated stock price 
on june   the ipo defendants agreed to participate in a global settlement of this case along with the settlement of hundreds of other similar ipo allocation cases pending in the southern district of new york 
any settlement owed by us will be funded exclusively by a portion of the proceeds of the company s directors and officers insurance policy and will result in the dismissal of this lawsuit and release by the plaintiff shareholder class of the ipo defendants 
in july  the lemelson medical  educational research foundation limited partnership lemelson filed suit in the federal district court in the district of arizona against us and approximately ninety other defendants 
the suit alleges that all the defendants are violating more than a dozen patents owned by the third party which allegedly cover the fields of machine vision used extensively in pick and place manufacturing of circuit boards and bar code scanning 
we purchased this equipment from vendors  whom we believe may have an obligation to indemnify us in the event that the equipment infringes 
table of contents any third party patents 
the complaint seeks damages in an unspecified amount for the purported patent infringements 
the complaint does not specify which defendants or activities allegedly violated which particular patents 
we have responded with a motion for more definite statement designed to identify the allegedly infringing activities as well as the particular patents and claims allegedly being infringed by it 
since our filing of our motion for more definite statement  the entire case has been stayed in order to allow an earlier filed case with common factual and legal issues to proceed 
we cannot be sure that we will prevail in this action and any adverse outcome could require us  among other things  to pay royalties to the third party patent owner 
given the lack of specificity in the complaint  it is not currently possible to calculate the potential for  or extent of  any liability resulting from this claim 
we also cannot be sure that we will not receive other claims alleging infringement in the future
