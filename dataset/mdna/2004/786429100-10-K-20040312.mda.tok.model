the following section builds upon earlier discussion and provides more information about our company and our financial performance 
we are an insurance and investment company with headquarters in seattle  washington 
we sell insurance and investment products through a national network of independent agents  brokers and financial advisors 
our business helps people protect what they value and deal with the unexpected 
we started our business in we earn revenue from insurance policy premiums fees for investment management and advisory services performed policy fees and charges on life insurance and investment type contracts income on our invested assets we have two major businesses property casualty p c provides auto and homeowners insurance to individuals  commercial insurance for small and medium sized businesses and surety bonds 
life investments l i provides individual life and group medical insurance  retirement services  annuities  mutual funds and investment advisory services 
in our ongoing effort to position our company for future profitability and growth  we announced a strategic decision in september to focus more fully on our p c businesses and pursue the sale of our l i operations 
more information about our decision can be found on pages to in part i  item reviewing our results of operations our financial results for the last three years have been impacted by the major strategic actions we have taken to turn our company around  reshape our p c business and become a more focused and successful competitor 

table of contents in  our major strategic initiatives included focusing on p c operations reducing expenses partnering with independent distributors marketing standardized products providing multiple p c product lines focusing on p c on september   we announced our decision to focus on p c operations and put our l i businesses up for sale 
we intend to use a portion of the proceeds to reduce our debt to a level appropriate for our new size following the sale and then assess whether to retain any amount to support our business growth 
we will return the balance of the proceeds to shareholders in the form of a special dividend  a stock repurchase  or a combination of both 
reducing expenses we have identified expense reductions across the company that will enable us to better compete in the property and casualty insurance markets 
we plan to eliminate approximately positions in our corporate departments 
the majority of these positions were eliminated by year end this initiative will reduce our operating expenses by approximately this excludes any reduction due to the sale of our l i businesses 
partnering with distributors our strategy focuses on providing more products for our distributors to sell that more accurately match price to customer risk characteristics 
in addition  we are focusing on making it easier for distributors to use our new point of sale technology  providing greater operating efficiencies in their offices 
our distributors can be more profitable selling our products through use of this technology  and our commission programs are structured to incent profitable growth 
in short  we offer our distribution partners more products to sell  make it easier for them to sell and service these products  helping our distributors make more money selling our products 
marketing standardized products our standardized personal auto  homeowners and small business products have been designed to serve the insurance needs of the majority of the individuals and small to medium sized businesses in the us marketplace 
these products are delivered over a common sales and service platform using point of sale technology that can process and service transactions quickly and easily 
providing multiple product lines we believe that our ability to provide multiple property and casualty product lines gives us a shelf space advantage in our distributors offices 
our auto  homeowners and small commercial insurance products represent the products our distribution partners sell most  and generally represent more than of the insurance revenues sold from an agent s office 
in  we reshaped our p c business to improve profitability and position our company for growth 
our major strategic actions included improving sales growth through independent agents driving execution through enhanced metrics improving service and claims handling strengthening our financial position continuing to invest in our employees 
table of contents improving sales growth through independent agents we began the rollout of our automated underwriting platform 
this technology made it easier for agents to sell all our primary lines personal auto  homeowners and small commercial 
driving execution through enhanced metrics we established financial metrics for the company and each business unit 
we developed individual goals that aligned the performance of the workforce with the company and business unit metrics 
we also shifted to a monthly financial close to better understand and act on results 
improving service and claims handling we launched a multi year training effort to drive out errors from our processes involving customers 
we initiated projects to eliminate mistakes that degrade service and waste money 
strengthening our financial position we took a number of actions including replacing our short term commercial paper borrowings with long term senior notes and developing a plan to refinance of long term debt  issuing common stock and strengthening the capital base of our p c and l i operations  and repositioning our investment portfolio  reducing risk and volatility 
continuing to invest in our employees we implemented a total performance management system that encompasses goal setting  employee development  and compensation tied to individual and team performance 
we also completed work and began implementation of our diversity strategy  tied to our workforce  distributors  suppliers and customer base 
in  we focused on turning around our company  which had poor profitability  particularly in our p c businesses 
our major strategic actions included executing a successful recovery plan to return our p c operations to profitability reducing expenses strengthening our financial position investing in our employees executing a successful recovery plan we refocused on our core strengths in personal auto  small to medium sized commercial insurance  and life insurance and asset management 
our recovery plan focused on pricing each of our insurance products to achieve an appropriate profit level 
we increased rates across all lines of our business 
we began reunderwriting across all lines of business 
in addition  we terminated relationships with underperforming agents who were writing unprofitable business with us 
we also exited lines of business that were not core to our strategy and expertise 
reducing expenses we restructured our p c and corporate operations and consolidated regional offices 
strengthening our financial position to strengthen our financial position  we sold our safeco credit subsidiary  reduced our quarterly dividend by and wrote down goodwill by  pretax 
investing in our employees we introduced a new performance based compensation system  linking employee pay directly to achievement of specific goals that support our business plans 
in addition  we started developing a diversity strategy to accelerate our ability to compete in today s business world 

table of contents overall results we view our results on an overall basis by three primary measures of performance earnings per share eps growth return on equity roe revenue growth the following tables show the trends in these three primary measures of performance net income per diluted share net return on equity revenues segment results to understand the difference between business and reportable segments  see also note in our notes to the consolidated financial statements on page how we report our results we manage our p c businesses in four business and eight reportable segments safeco personal insurance spi personal auto homeowners specialty safeco business insurance sbi sbi regular sbi special accounts facility sbi runoff surety p c other we manage our l i businesses in six reportable segments group income annuities retirement services individual asset management l i other 
table of contents in addition to these segments  certain activities such as interest expense and intercompany eliminations are reported in corporate and not allocated to individual segments 
how we measure profitability property casualty we use two measures of our underwriting results to assess the profitability of our p c businesses 
these measures are underwriting profit or loss and combined ratio 
underwriting profit or loss is our net earned premiums less our losses from claims  loss adjustment expenses lae and underwriting expenses 
combined ratio is our losses  lae and underwriting expenses divided by our net earned premiums 
we report combined ratio as a percentage 
for example  a combined ratio of means that our losses  lae and underwriting expenses equal of our net earned premiums and result in a underwriting profit 
a lower combined ratio reflects better underwriting results than a higher combined ratio 
we don t include our investment portfolio results when measuring the profitability of our p c businesses 
that s because we manage the investment portfolio separately from our underwriting activities 
life investments we measure our l i results using pretax operating earnings 
this measure excludes from earnings net realized investment gains and losses 
we believe that looking at pretax operating earnings enhances the understanding of our l i results of operations 
net realized investment gains and losses can fluctuate significantly and distort the comparison of our results 
investment results investment activities are an important part of our business 
we invest insurance premiums received in a diversified portfolio until they re needed to pay claims 
income from our investments is a significant part of our total revenues 
our investment philosophy is to emphasize investment yield  balanced with investment quality and risk provide for liquidity when needed diversify our portfolio match the duration of the invested asset portfolio with the expected policyholder liability durations we measure our investment results in two parts the net investment income that we earn on our invested assets and the net realized investment gains and losses we recognize when we sell or impair investments 
application of critical accounting estimates we have identified the accounting estimates listed below as critical to understanding our results of operations and financial condition 
the application of these accounting estimates requires our management to use judgments involving assumptions and estimates about future results  trends or other developments that could significantly influence our results if actual experience differs from those assumptions and estimates 
we review these judgments frequently 
an understanding of them may help readers understand our consolidated financial statements and md a 
we consider our most critical accounting estimates to be p c loss and loss adjustment expense reserves 
table of contents p c reinsurance valuation of investments p c loss and loss adjustment expense reserves estimating our loss and lae reserves requires us to make significant judgments and use many assumptions 
at year end and  our loss and lae reserves by business segment before reinsurance were december safeco personal insurance safeco business insurance p c other surety total safeco personal insurance spi spi loss and lae reserves are estimated using standard actuarial methods 
these methods involve analyzing past claims experience for recent changes in business claim practices and the environment 
emphasis is placed on evaluating claims reporting and closing patterns as well as the size of loss payments and case basis reserves 
spi losses and related expenses are analyzed by line of business  product  coverage and geographic area 
personal auto policies provide coverage for bodily injury  uninsured motorists  personal injury protection  medical payments  property damage  comprehensive and collision losses 
bodily injury bi coverage represents the largest portion of our loss and lae reserves held for personal auto 
we estimate the growth in bi loss costs will be moderate  with the frequency of losses increasing and the severity of claims declining 
in arriving at these assumptions we considered our changing mix of business as our business grows  we write more policies in markets where we have not written significant business previously 
we expect to write more standard and non standard risks which have  on average  higher frequencies than preferred risks 
our increase in new business  which generally has higher claim frequencies than business that has been on the books for longer than one year general inflation and medical cost trends our homeowners and specialty lines are generally short tailed  which means most claims are reported and settled within months 
we use standard actuarial techniques to estimate reserves for those lines 
reserve estimates for the homeowners line continue to be favorably impacted by double digit declines in frequency of claims 
safeco business insurance sbi sbi primarily writes commercial multi peril  property  workers compensation  automobile and general liability insurance for small to medium sized businesses 
sbi has exposure to asbestos  environmental and other toxic tort and construction defect losses and related expenses through the general liability  commercial multi peril and umbrella coverages it provides 
these exposures and the risks they present to us are discussed in the p c other segment below  where the majority of the reserves reside 
the remainder of the sbi reserve discussion excludes these exposures 

table of contents workers compensation estimating reserves for workers compensation involves a high degree of uncertainty and judgment 
that s because many claims have long term payout periods that increase the impact of inflation trends over time  particularly medical cost inflation 
legislative actions and judicial interpretations can unpredictably affect benefits 
some claims are not made immediately  as a result  we remain exposed to workers compensation losses arising from policies written years ago 
the following table shows our loss and allocated lae reserves for voluntary and non voluntary workers compensation and other relevant data 
the table excludes unallocated lae reserves reserves not assigned to specific claims 
at year end  our unallocated lae reserves were december losses and allocated lae payments reserves at end of year  before reinsurance earned premiums claims number of claims reported claims in the year open claims at the end of the year the decreases in premiums since result primarily from our strategy to limit our workers compensation writings in states where rate levels fall below our profitability targets 
in particular  we significantly restricted writing new workers compensation business in california beginning in the third quarter of factors in estimating loss reserves for workers compensation workers compensation claims are mostly composed of medical costs and salary wage payments while claimants are out of work indemnity payments 
the main factors in estimating loss and lae reserves for workers compensation are medical cost inflation trends changes in state workers compensation statutes that are applied retroactively changes in our business workers compensation claims reporting and payout periods payout periods for workers compensation claims can be years or more 
however  because we focus on low hazard risks  our average payout period is generally shorter than the industry average 
since  changes in our business have included improving our claims handling practices  putting greater emphasis on early recognition of exposure potential in case reserves focusing on the settlement of long term claims  increasing the number that we settle focusing our writings on small to medium sized businesses limiting our workers compensation writings in states where rate levels fall below our profitability targets while we expect these business practice changes to reduce our ultimate losses  they have decreased the 
table of contents predictive value of our past data in estimating future losses 
with this in mind  in the second quarter of  we began performing additional actuarial analysis primarily focused on medical inflation trends and changes in safeco claim practices and mix of business 
this produced divergent indications 
as a consequence  in the third quarter of  we took additional steps to evaluate medical inflation trends  reviewing safeco and industry data our claim files loss reserve trends by state case reserving patterns and practices our analysis showed higher medical payouts than previously expected longer payout periods than previously expected relatively stable indemnity payouts based on our analysis  we increased our loss and lae reserves for workers compensation losses occurring in prior years by pretax during the third quarter of of this increase  was related to loss and allocated lae reserves 
this increase included in sbi runoff  in sbi regular and in sbi special accounts facility 
the largest amount of reserve development relates to california  particularly the large account business that we began exiting in we also increased unallocated lae reserves by pretax 
this increase included in sbi runoff  in sbi regular and in sbi special accounts facility 
this increase reflects our estimate of the ongoing expense of servicing workers compensation claims 
as claims remain open for longer periods of time  our costs to handle those claims rise 
in determining management s best estimate for workers compensation reserves  long term medical cost inflation trends over the average claim payout period represent our most significant assumption 
we have assumed that double digit medical cost inflation will continue in the near term  moderating over time to historic levels  resulting in a medical loss severity trend over the life of the reserves 
our best estimate of workers compensation reserves presents risk of unfavorable reserve development should medical trends not abate 
other sbi we also maintain loss and lae reserves for our other sbi products 
these include other than asbestos  environmental  other toxic tort and construction defects claims  which are discussed separately below commercial multi peril monoline property monoline general liability commercial automobile commercial umbrella commercial umbrella insurance provides protection to our customers beyond the limits of their primary liability policies 
as a consequence  this product tends to result in fewer claims with higher average costs than most other commercial coverages 
these claims are also reported to us more slowly than most other commercial coverages 
for this line our actuarial techniques produce a wider range of results 
management considers these results together with any changes in the product or the customer profile when establishing reserve estimates 

table of contents generally  the payout periods for our other sbi products are relatively short 
as a result  our estimated loss reserves for these products are subject to less variability than our workers compensation reserves 
we use standard actuarial techniques to estimate these loss reserves 
p c other this section combines the loss reserves information from our sbi and p c other business segments for asbestos environmental and other toxic tort claims construction defects asbestos this table shows our loss and allocated lae reserves for asbestos related claims 
the table excludes unallocated lae reserves 
at year end  our unallocated lae reserves for asbestos were december losses and allocated lae payments  before reinsurance loss and allocated lae payments  net of reinsurance reserves at end of year  before reinsurance reserves at end of year  net of reinsurance three year survival ratio  gross three year survival ratio  net claims and average costs open claims at end of year average paid per closed claim average case reserve per open claim number of claims and whole dollars  net of reinsurance 
on this table  the three year survival ratio represents the number of years that our current loss reserves would last if future payments are made at the same average annual rate experienced over the last three years 
the three year survival ratio is equal to our loss reserves divided by our average annual payment over the last three years 
due to volatility and sparseness of data  estimating loss reserves for asbestos claims requires more than standard actuarial techniques 
as a result  we analyze and consider claims statistics and trends  directional trends in survival ratios  and applicable law and coverage litigation 
our asbestos liability exposure here s the breakout of our asbestos loss reserves relates to the runoff assumed reinsurance operations of american states  which we acquired in  and our exposure to syndicates and pools 
relates to our direct exposure  included in sbi regular 
accordingly  we ve established two separate  special claims handling functions  one that specializes in asbestos claims related to our runoff assumed reinsurance operations and one that specializes in asbestos claims related to our direct exposure 

table of contents our exposure through our runoff assumed reinsurance operations is primarily reinsurance of excess coverage 
this business also exposes us to syndicates and pools  which resulted in increased asbestos payments in pools are groups of insurers that enter into agreements to share exposure related to specific insureds 
our loss reserve estimates for pools reflect the loss reserve estimates provided by the pools independent actuaries 
the loss experience of our runoff assumed reinsurance operations follows the general industry trend 
our direct exposure is primarily due to smaller and more peripheral entities becoming defendants in asbestos claims 
our exposure to the major high profile asbestos defendants is limited 
that s because our business strategy resulted in us not writing direct coverages for larger companies 
in addition  we do not have direct exposure to businesses or claims that are the subject of settlement agreements 
at year end  our unassigned ibnr was of our loss reserves for asbestos claims 
we categorize our policyholders with active asbestos claims in two groups according to their exposure  consisting of large asbestos accounts our policyholders with cumulative loss payments exceeding  as of december  small asbestos accounts our policyholders with cumulative loss payments of less than  as of december  this table provides details about our policyholders and losses paid related to asbestos loss reserves for number of policyholders net paid net asbestos reserves of asbestos reserves assumed reinsurance and pools policyholders with active claims large asbestos accounts small asbestos accounts total policyholders with settlement agreements unassigned ibnr total estimating loss reserves for asbestos estimating loss reserves for asbestos claims requires more judgment than our other lines of business 
that s primarily because past claim experience may not be representative of future claims 
several factors make it difficult to predict future asbestos claim payments 
they include insufficient data inherent risk of major litigation diverging legal interpretations regulatory actions legislative actions 
table of contents increases in bankruptcy proceedings non impaired claimants being allowed to make claims efforts by insureds to obtain coverage not subject to aggregate limits changes in these factors could result in future asbestos claims payments that are significantly different from those currently predicted 
in estimating our loss reserves for asbestos claims  we consider applicable law and coverage litigation review our ground up analysis completed in perform actuarial analysis for smaller accounts using industry information and safeco information make no judgments regarding ongoing congressional reform efforts some asbestos related claims are subject to non product liability coverage rather than product liability coverage 
non product liability coverage might not be subject to policy aggregate limits 
that could result in higher asbestos claims payments and related expenses 
our loss reserve estimates assume that emerging unfavorable industry trends will increase our level of asbestos payments in our runoff assumed reinsurance operations within the next two years 
our loss reserve estimates assume that the payments for our direct asbestos exposure in will return to and prior levels in the future 
this assumption is based on the small number of accounts generating the payments 
ten accounts represent or two thirds of the payments 
the limited number of accounts we wrote of the nature that generated the payments 
year to year volatility in claim and payment activity 
our loss reserve estimates also assume that the severities of future claims will remain relatively unchanged 
environmental and other toxic tort claims this table shows our loss and allocated lae reserves for our liability coverages related to environmental and other toxic tort claims 
the table excludes unallocated lae reserves 
at year end  our unallocated lae reserves were december losses and allocated lae payments  before reinsurance loss and allocated lae payments  net of reinsurance reserves at end of year  before reinsurance reserves at end of year  net of reinsurance three year survival ratio  gross three year survival ratio  net claims and average costs open claims at end of year average paid per closed claim average case reserve per open claim number of claims and whole dollars  net of reinsurance 
our environmental and other toxic tort claims exposure our environmental and other toxic tort 
table of contents claims result from our runoff assumed reinsurance operations and our commercial general liability line that we write on a direct basis 
we generally have avoided writing coverages for large companies with substantial exposures to environmental and other toxic tort claims 
as a result  our average environmental claim tends to be small 
at year end  our unassigned ibnr was of our loss reserves for environmental and other toxic tort claims 
in  we reached a settlement related to a large number of environmental claims related to coverage on general liability policies written for individual gasoline stations 
under these policies  there was a petrochemical company named as an additional insured 
we have settled all claims with the additional insured 
this global settlement and future indemnification agreement is included in our payment activity 
we have no other reported claims of this nature 
other payments in reflect year to year volatility in claim and payment activity 
estimating loss reserves for environmental and other toxic tort claims the volatility of actuarial estimates of liabilities for environmental and other toxic tort claims is often greater than that of other exposures 
that s due to factors including insufficient data changes in the number and types of defendants involved with these claims unresolved legal issues including existence of coverage  definition of ultimate damages and final allocation of damages due from the financially responsible parties due to the volatility and sparseness of data  estimating loss reserves for environmental and other toxic tort claims requires more than standard actuarial techniques 
as a result  we analyze and consider claim statistics and trends directional trends in survival ratios applicable law and coverage litigation construction defects this table shows our loss and allocated lae reserves for construction defect claims 
the table excludes unallocated lae reserves 
at year end  our unallocated lae reserves were december losses and allocated lae payments  before reinsurance loss and allocated lae payments  net of reinsurance reserves at end of year  before reinsurance reserves at end of year  net of reinsurance claims and average costs open claims at end of year average settlement cost  including legal expenses number of claims and whole dollars  net of reinsurance 
note certain reclassifications have been made to the prior year amounts to conform to the current year presentation 
our construction defect claims exposure our exposure to construction defect claims comes from general liability and commercial multi peril coverages we have provided to contractors 
construction defect claims result from alleged defective work performed in the construction of large habitation structures that include apartments  condominiums and large developments of single family dwellings or other housing 

table of contents construction defect claims often seek payment for damages resulting directly from the alleged defective construction work and diminished economic value of the structure meaning that the structure has less market value because of the alleged defective construction work 
construction defect claims are complex  with an inherent difficulty in determining fault 
most of our claims are concentrated in a small number of states  including california 
we have taken a number of actions to mitigate our exposure to construction defect claims and enable us to vigorously defend our coverage position 
they include stricter underwriting standards a separate claims handling function and internal legal counsel specializing in construction defect claims relationships with external legal counsel specializing in construction defect claims estimating loss reserves for construction defect claims the main factors in estimating loss reserves for construction defect claims are changing legal and regulatory environments statutes of limitations and statutes of repose in filing these claims diminished value claims involvement of multiple plaintiffs  defendants and insurers long periods of time between the actual construction work and the date the claim is reported the uncertainty created by these factors requires more judgment in estimating loss reserves for construction defect claims than for our other lines of business 
we use techniques developed specifically for estimating loss reserves for construction defect claims 
with these techniques  we estimate the number of future claims and the average value of every claim and make adjustments for anticipated changes in coverage interpretations  regulations  judicial rulings  plaintiff attorney involvement and changes in our book of business 
over the last three years  our number of open construction defect claims has decreased steadily an average drop of per year 
our loss reserve estimates assume that the number of open claims will continue to decrease  but at a slower rate 
the slowing will come from increases in construction defect claims outside of california and extended or exempted statutes of limitations for loss reporting in certain jurisdictions 
our loss reserve estimates also assume that our claims handling function modestly reduces loss severity 
surety our surety contracts insure construction performance  as well as legal matters that include probate and bankruptcies 
by their nature  surety claims result in lower loss frequency and higher loss severity than most of our p c businesses 
in addition  surety claims provide us with substantial opportunity for subrogation and salvage  the nature and extent of which vary from case to case 
to estimate loss reserves for surety  we examine actuarial analysis large claim analysis reinsurance terms and conditions individual insured exposure analysis analysis of subrogation and salvage potential 
table of contents our expected salvage and subrogation recoveries exceeded our loss reserves by at december  surety reserves fluctuate from period to period due to the lag between the time when payments are made on a claim and the time when we receive salvage and subrogation amounts 
p c reinsurance on page  we began our discussion with a look at the various types of reinsurance and policy terms 
here  we focus on estimation of reinsurance recoverables 
the reinsurance we buy limits our losses on certain individual risks or reduces our exposure to catastrophic events 
we buy it from several reinsurers and are not dependent upon any single reinsurer 
reinsurance recoverables are the amounts our reinsurers owe us related to the losses we have incurred 
we reported at december  and at december  in p c reinsurance recoverables as assets on our consolidated balance sheets 
recording reinsurance recoverables requires us to make estimates because we do not know the exact amount due from the reinsurer until all our underlying losses are settled 
the amount of reinsurance recoverables varies depending on the size of individual losses and the aggregate amount of losses in particular lines of business 
to estimate reinsurance recoverables  we review estimates of large losses that are covered under reinsurance agreements review reinsurance recoverable amounts for specific claims as well as for lines of business compare our estimates with past reinsurance recoverables perform actuarial analyses of loss development above and below our retention levels the amounts we absorb before the reinsurers reimburse us specified under the reinsurance agreements examine actuarial data with and without reinsurance recoverables estimating an allowance for uncollectible reinsurance recoverables we regularly review our reinsurance recoverables to determine the collectibility of what is owed to us 
in doing that  we review historical collection experience reinsurance recoverables associated with individual reinsurers  including large exposures and those with lower rated reinsurers reinsurance recoverables concentrated with a particular event or issue for example  a large loss  a catastrophe or an emerging claim issue trends in default rates by credit rating our estimated allowance for uncollectible reinsurance was at december  and at december  the increase in reflects the impact on our recoverables of the industry wide decline in creditworthiness of reinsurers since valuation of investments our investments include fixed maturities and equity securities  which we report at fair value as available for sale securities on our consolidated balance sheets 
the fixed maturities we invest in include bonds  mortgage backed securities and redeemable preferred stock 
the equity securities we invest in include common stock and non redeemable preferred stock 

table of contents how we determine other than temporary declines in the value of our investments we regularly review the fair value of our investments 
if the fair value of any of our investments falls below our cost basis in the investment  we analyze the decrease to determine whether it is an other than temporary decline in value 
to make this determination for each security  we consider how long and by how much the fair value of the security has been below its cost the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer of the security  including any specific events that may affect its operations or earnings potential our intent and ability to keep the security long enough for it to recover its value any downgrades of the security by a rating agency any reduction or elimination of dividends or non payment of scheduled interest payments based on our analysis  we make a judgment as to whether the loss is other than temporary 
sometimes  an investment loss that we consider temporary in one quarter can become other than temporary in a future quarter 
if the loss is other than temporary  we record an impairment charge within net realized investment gains losses in our consolidated statements of income loss in the period we make that determination 
we recorded of these impairment charges in and in the impairment charges in included that was incurred because of our intent to sell our l i businesses  together with their investment portfolio 
this charge related to all l i securities with unrealized losses at september  and at december  and our expectation that these securities will not recover in value before the completion of a sale 
determining the fair value of our investments in most cases  we use public market price information to determine the fair value of our investments when such information is available 
when third party market information is not available  as in the case of securities that are not publicly traded  we use other valuation techniques 
such techniques include using independent pricing sources evaluating discounted cash flows identifying comparable securities with quoted market prices based on industry sector  credit quality and maturity using internally prepared valuations based on certain modeling and pricing methods we used these other valuation techniques to estimate the fair value of in fixed maturities and in equity securities on our consolidated balance sheets as of december  these amounts represented of our total investment portfolio 
in fixed maturities and in equity securities on our consolidated balance sheets as of december  these amounts represented of our total investment portfolio

the increase in consolidated net income in over our loss in was driven by improved results in the p c operations and increased l i earnings 
our results in included a goodwill write off of  pretax  as a result of a change in accounting policy for assessing goodwill from undiscounted cash flows to a market value method and a gain from the sale of our credit operations of consolidated revenues the increases in and in consolidated revenues reflected overall growth in p c earned premiums and l i premiums and other revenues 
declines in our net realized investment gains losses offset some of that increase 
increases in our p c earned premiums resulted from growth in policies in force in our personal auto segment and premium rate increases across all our lines of business 
increases in our l i revenues resulted primarily from our acquisition of the swiss re life health america holding company swiss re stop loss medical business in july our net realized investment losses in primarily resulted from our impairment losses 
the losses reflect of impairments  including related to our intent to sell l i 
specific industries that contributed to impairments in included airline and air transportation 
the net realized investment gains included impairments of in and in  reflecting the impact of credit deterioration and corporate failures particularly in airline and telecommunication sectors 
in  these impairments were offset by gains realized on repositioning our p c investment portfolio 

table of contents net investment income increased slightly in due to improved p c cash flows from better underwriting results  partially offset by lower interest rates on our investments 
losses  lae and policy benefits the increase in losses and lae resulted from a increase to our workers compensation reserves for prior year losses  and an increase in catastrophe losses of in over improvement in our loss ratio for our personal insurance operations however  offset some of that increase in similarly  tighter underwriting standards resulted in lower losses and lae in compared with our loss ratios in personal auto were in in in our loss ratios in homeowners were in in in the improving ratios resulted from price increases  segmented underwriting that better matched rate and risk and favorable loss experience  particularly from lower claims frequency in homeowners 
also contributing to the decrease in our losses and lae in compared with were lower catastrophe losses of in compared with catastrophe losses of in  and a third quarter reserve strengthening of underwriting  acquisition and operating expenses the increases in underwriting  acquisition and operating expenses primarily resulted from growth in our businesses in the increase in was due to higher commissions we paid on new auto policies  higher training costs for our claims handlers and costs related to the rollout of our automated underwriting platform 
restructuring charges the restructuring charges in include the elimination of approximately positions related to corporate expense reductions 
we expect this initiative to reduce our operating expenses by approximately the and restructuring charges relate to the elimination of approximately  positions to reorganize our p c and corporate operations and consolidate regional offices 

table of contents reconciling segment results the following table assists in reconciling our gaap results  specifically the income loss from continuing operations before income taxes and change in accounting principle line from our consolidated statements of income loss to our segment performance measures year ended december p c l i corporate income loss from continuing operations before income taxes and change in accounting principle these gaap results are further detailed into segment underwriting results and pretax operating earnings 
underwriting results and pretax operating earnings provide a helpful picture of how our company is doing 
however  using them to measure profitability while fairly common in our industry is not consistent with gaap 
our p c operating results the primary measures of our operating results include our underwriting profits or losses  net earned premiums and combined ratios 
the next three tables report those key items by our reportable segments for the last three years 
more information about the results also by reportable segment follows the tables 
first  underwriting profits losses are our measure of each segment s performance year ended december underwriting profits losses personal auto homeowners specialty spi total sbi regular sbi special accounts facility sbi runoff sbi total surety p c other total underwriting losses net investment income goodwill amortization goodwill write off restructuring charges net realized investment gains income loss from continuing operations before income taxes and change in accounting principle

using ratios helps us see our operating trends without the effect of changes in net earned premiums combined ratios year ended december personal auto homeowners specialty spi total sbi regular sbi special accounts facility sbi runoff sbi total surety p c other total p c operations combined ratios are gaap basis 
expressed as a percentage  they are equal to losses and expenses divided by net earned premiums 
not meaningful because this is a runoff business with minimal premium 
personal auto year ended december net earned premiums underwriting profit loss net earned premiums net earned premiums increased by in and in the increases in net earned premiums were driven by increases in filed rates we file rate changes on a state by state basis 
overall  we received approval for average rate increases in the mid single digits in and 
table of contents premium trend premiums are impacted by the increases in the portion of our policies that insure newer and more expensive cars  or premium trend 
personal auto premium trend increased average rates in the low single digits in and growth of policies in force pif pif grew by in and by in  reflecting the introduction of our new business entry model using point of sale pos underwriting technology and stable retention rates 
our new auto policies grew in over  and in over underwriting results and combined ratio in  we achieved an underwriting profit our first since our loss ratio has steadily improved to in from in and in these lower loss ratios were primarily driven by improved rate adequacy as discussed above  rates increased in and  while loss costs  adjusted for the growth in standard and non standard business  increased only slightly during that period 
disciplined underwriting through our automated underwriting platform that provides more segmentation and better matching of rates to risk characteristics 
these reductions in loss ratios were the primary contributors to the improvements in our combined ratios in in in driving our results we re achieving our growth and improved results through four strategic initiatives in our personal auto line offering a new auto insurance product introducing our new business entry model using point of sale pos technology paying commissions that incent profitable growth improving the claims management process offering a new auto insurance product our new auto insurance product offers up to underwriting tiers 
these additional tiers provide a more accurate price for a wider range of risks 
we re better able to assign the right price to the corresponding level of risk  producing greater precision and greater profitability 
also  tiers expand the risks that we can underwrite and price  so that we have an auto product available for about of all applicants quoted by our agents 
our new auto insurance product is now available in of the states where we sell auto insurance 
introducing our new business entry model in early  we introduced our new business entry model using pos underwriting technology 
this model makes it easier for our distributors to sell our new auto insurance product 
accessing the system from their offices  our distributors follow a series of easy to use screens to complete the sale 
this helps our agents to be more efficient in processing auto business 
paying commissions to incent profitable growth in early  we introduced some changes to our commission structure that have contributed to higher sales during and we increased commissions from to on new auto policies 
the increase applies to the first six month policy period 
in addition  we revised the bonus commission structure for our agents in the new structure aligns their incentives with our growth and profitability goals 

table of contents improving the claims management process better claims handling processes also contributed to our improved performance 
we ve made investments in training for our claims handlers and we now have more efficient processes and better metrics to measure key performance drivers 
our claims processing combines the efficiency of centralized claims handling  customer service centers and the flexibility of field representatives 
using our paperless claims environment  our field representatives are not restricted to a specific office or physical location 
this flexibility adds significant savings and efficiencies to the claims handling process and increases customer service 
where we re headed we anticipate the following factors will impact growth and profitability in the near future rates we plan to file for rate increases to at least keep pace with the rate of underlying loss cost growth 
we anticipate loss cost growth to be in the range in actual rate changes obtained may vary  based on the rate needed in a given state combined with regulatory review and approval  and developments in loss cost trends 
business growth as our business grows  we will write more policies in markets where we have not written significant business previously 
we expect to write more standard and non standard risks which have  on average  higher frequencies than preferred risks 
product pricing and segmentation we will continue to refine our pricing structure to more precisely match rate to risk 
expenses we expect to continue the improvement in our expense ratio for personal auto  as a result of the savings from our corporate restructuring 
overall barring extraordinary catastrophes and other unusual events  we expect our personal auto segment to grow  while operating at our target combined ratio of  in homeowners year ended december net earned premiums underwriting profit loss net earned premiums net earned premiums increased by in and in the increases in net earned premiums were impacted by increases in filed rates we file rate changes on a state by state basis 
overall we received approval for average rate changes in the high single digits in and the low to mid teens in additionally  premiums are impacted by automatic increases in the amount of insurance coverage to adjust for inflation in building costs 
this was in the low single digits in and decline in pif the number of policies that did not renew in and exceeded the number of new policies written in each year  leading to a net reduction in pif of in and in lower new business due to moratoriums in certain unprofitable states also resulted in our pif declining during currently  we have moratoriums in only two states  down from states at december  
table of contents underwriting results and combined ratio in  we achieved an underwriting profit in our homeowners line  our first underwriting profit in more than a decade 
our loss ratio steadily improved to in from in and in these lower loss ratios were primarily driven by improved rate adequacy as discussed above  rates increased in and  while loss costs declined during that period 
loss frequency the decrease in loss costs was driven by double digit decreases in claims frequency the average number of claims filed that are not catastrophe related 
this was only partially offset by increases in claims severity the average cost per claim 
loss frequency in was lower in all areas fire  theft and other perils 
our frequency fell by in and in the trend toward higher deductibles with many homeowners increasing their deductibles from to has significantly reduced the number of frequent  maintenance type claims 
improvements in frequency outpaced severity increases  resulting in improving loss costs 
severity increases reflect inflationary trends in repair material and labor costs 
the reductions in loss costs were the primary contributor to the improvements in our combined ratios which were in in in catastrophe losses catastrophes involve multiple claims and policyholders 
we cannot accurately predict catastrophes  and the number and type of catastrophes can vary widely 
the losses they could cause might significantly exceed our prior experience 
catastrophes include hurricanes  windstorms  earthquakes  hailstorms  explosions  severe winter weather  fires and acts of terrorism 
our catastrophe losses returned to historical averages in catastrophe losses were unusually low in and unusually high in our pretax catastrophe losses after reinsurance for the last three years were in in in catastrophe losses for included pretax for the wildfires in california 
the catastrophes in included pretax for a single wind and hailstorm in st 
louis 
driving our results we re achieving improved profitability in homeowners through five strategic initiatives offering a new homeowners insurance pricing structure introducing our new business entry model using point of sale pos technology reunderwriting our homeowners business in selected states 
table of contents changing policy language improving the claims management process offering a new homeowners insurance product our new homeowners product generally offers nine underwriting tiers 
this increased segmentation means we are better able to align rate with risk  and to offer coverage to more homeowners 
we have obtained approval to sell our new product in of the states in which we are licensed to sell business 
introducing our new business entry model in early  we introduced our new business entry model using point of sale pos underwriting technology 
this model makes it easier for our distributors to sell our new homeowners insurance product 
reunderwriting our homeowners business in selected states during  we reviewed and updated our data for current policyholders in several states to make sure we had accurate information concerning their property 
this helped us ensure that we are charging the appropriate premium for the risk insured 
changing policy language we placed a cap on the maximum amount payable in a total loss of of the home s insured value 
in some cases  we have taken steps to restrict coverage  primarily on mold damages 
these restrictions generally cap mold damages at thousand  including remediation costs 
improving the claims management process better claims handling processes also contributed to our improved performance 
we ve made investments in training for our claims handlers and we now have more efficient processes  and better metrics to measure key performance drivers 
our claims processing combines the efficiency of centralized claims handling  customer service centers and the flexibility of field representatives 
using our paperless claims environment  our field representatives are not restricted to a specific office or physical location 
this flexibility adds significant savings and efficiencies to the claims handling process and increases customer service 
where we re headed we anticipate the following factors will impact growth and profitability in our homeowners segment in the near future rates we plan to file for rate increases to at least keep pace with the rate of underlying loss cost growth 
we anticipate this loss cost growth to be in the range in actual rate changes obtained may vary from this based on regulatory review and approval and development in loss cost trends 
business growth as our business grows  we will write more policies in markets where we have not written significant business previously 
we expect to write more standard risks which have  on average  higher frequencies than preferred risks 
product pricing and segmentation we will continue to refine our pricing structure and matching of rate to risk 
pif we expect to see further reduction in pif in  but at a slower rate of decline than the past two years  and in the second half of we expect pif levels to stabilize 
overall we do not expect to experience the same favorable frequency trends 
this will cause our margins in this business to move closer to our target combined ratio than the extraordinary results we experienced in the last half of 
table of contents specialty year ended december net earned premiums underwriting profit our specialty operation provides individuals with umbrella  earthquake  dwelling fire  inland marine  motorcycle and boat insurance 
these products serve to round out our personal lines offerings 
net earned premiums we experienced a small net decrease in pif in and  which was largely offset by our rate increases 
underwriting results and combined ratio the combined ratio improved to in  compared with in and in the increases in underwriting profit and decreases in combined ratio reflect lower claims experience in these lines 
where we re headed we anticipate stable results in we have not yet introduced our point of sale pos technology in specialty 
we expect growth in this line when those advancements in technology are introduced in sbi regular year ended december net earned premiums underwriting loss our sbi regular segment provides insurance for small to medium sized businesses those with annual written premiums of  or less 
this is our core commercial lines business 
its main products include business owner policies bop commercial auto commercial property commercial multi peril general liability workers compensation net earned premiums the fluctuations in net earned premiums are a result of the efforts we began in to restore profitability to this segment 
this included raising our average insurance prices tightening our underwriting standards not renewing unprofitable business introducing a redesigned business model for our distributors 
table of contents our average prices in sbi regular increased in in in the price increases and stricter underwriting practices caused decreases in our retention rate and new business 
with the continued rollout of our redesigned business model in  however  we recently have seen the trend of declining pif reverse as our retention stabilized and our new business growth strengthened 
over the last six months of  our pif increased slightly 
year over year  our pif decreased in and in underwriting results and combined ratio underwriting results in improved over  and improved over  reflecting our effort to restore profitability to this segment 
this effort included price increases  reunderwriting business and implementing our automated underwriting platform 
our automated underwriting platform provides a better matching of price to risk 
as a result  our combined ratios were in in in our underwriting results include the changes in our workers compensation reserves 
the estimation of workers compensation reserves involves a high degree of judgment and uncertainty 
we have reacted to increasing medical cost inflation trends  elongating payout periods and delayed claims reporting and have increased our reserves in the period such information becomes available and trends are known 
workers compensation reserves in sbi regular were increased in as part of the reserve strengthening in the third quarter in in as part of the reserve strengthening in the third quarter more information about our workers compensation reserves is in the p c loss and lae reserves section on page catastrophe losses increased in our catastrophe losses before tax and after reinsurance were in  in and in driving our results our effort to restore growth and profitability to this segment centers on our redesigned business model 
our redesigned business model includes automated underwriting platform introducing our new business entry model using point of sale pos technology business service center automated underwriting platform our automated underwriting platform provides improved matching of price to risk that allows us to offer policies to a wider range of small businesses 

table of contents we are seeing improvement in matching price to risk using our automated underwriting model 
this is a key competitive advantage as we can better segment our business and provide the best rate to our best customers  while higher risks are charged higher rates 
this has also allowed us to improve retention of our best customers 
introducing our point of sale technology the point of sale technology is an easy to use  web based interface that helps agents provide real time quotes to their customers quickly and efficiently 
in  this platform enabled us to profitably increase the number of new policies we sell 
we consistently closed more than of quotes with this point of sale technology 
sales of bop increased by over our levels  and in we began the launch of our commercial auto product and saw a increase in new business over our workers compensation product launched in november and will be phased in over the first few months of the final component to our automated platform will be the addition of commercial package policies and we will begin this implementation in late business service center we provide agents with an option to have us service the policies of their customers for a fee 
this allows the agent to focus on profitably growing their business and shifts the policy servicing activities to us 
early indications show that this service increases the retention of policyholders  benefiting both us and the agent 
where we re headed growth given the increasing number of small businesses in the united states and the lack of a dominant market leader  we see growth potential in this segment and aim to become the top insurance writer 
as we continue to roll out our automated underwriting platform and point of sale technology  we will grow our business by focusing on small business policies 
in  we will launch our online sales and service platform called safeco now 
while we have automated many of our major p c product lines over the last two years  safeco now will bring them all together on a unified platform featuring a single entry point and seamless cross sell capabilities 
the centerpiece of safeco now is a new business hub where distributors can quote and bind personal auto  homeowners and most small business products in just minutes 
additional p c products will go online over the next two years 
safeco now addresses our distributors three primary online needs to quote and issue new business to service an existing account to inquire about a claim we believe that safeco now will be a powerful tool to drive growth and greater efficiencies for our distributors and for us 
product pricing and segmentation we will continue to appropriately match rate with risk through segmentation and disciplined underwriting 
we will charge prices at acceptable profit levels and decline business when pricing or risk does not allow us to earn acceptable returns 
expenses we expect improvement in our expense ratio for sbi regular  as the savings from our corporate restructuring and the leveraging of our existing infrastructure with our automated underwriting platform and new business interface will impact financial results 

table of contents loss costs we anticipate that medical costs  auto repair and building material costs will continue to rise 
we strive to effectively manage these costs through efficient claims handling to help offset this loss cost inflation 
overall we expect good growth in pif and continued ability to maintain our target margins combined ratio 
sbi special accounts facility year ended december net earned premiums underwriting profit our sbi special accounts facility saf segment provides insurance for large commercial accounts customers who pay annual written premiums of more than while our main focus is the small to medium sized commercial market  we continue to serve some large commercial accounts on behalf of key agents and brokers who sell our core property and casualty products 
sixty percent of new small commercial business comes from distributors who also sell to large commercial accounts 
saf also provides insurance for the following specialty commercial insurance programs lender placed property agents errors and omissions predominantly for our agents mini storage and warehouse properties non profit social service organizations net earned premiums the increase in net earned premiums for saf in and was due to the consolidation of our business insurance products in as each existing large commercial policy was renewed reported in sbi runoff a decision was made by saf to renew or not 
if it was renewed  it became part of saf  otherwise the policy remained in sbi runoff 
net earned premiums increased in due to the acquisition of a lender placed property business from ace limited in september this acquisition increased net earned premiums by in underwriting results and combined ratio our combined ratio was in  compared with in and in the improvement in the combined ratios is a result of improved underwriting results in our large commercial business 
driving our results the changes in our net earned premiums  underwriting results and combined ratios over the last two years mainly resulted from the consolidation of our business insurance products 
as discussed above  this consolidation reflects the decisions we made as the large account policies came up for renewal 
we renewed only those that we could underwrite profitably within our redesigned business model 

table of contents we also took aggressive actions in to reunderwrite existing saf business  applying stricter underwriting standards and increasing rates 
these actions improved our underwriting results in and where we re headed our goal is to provide a limited large commercial resource for those distributors who are also writing auto  homeowners or small to medium sized commercial insurance with us 
sbi runoff year ended december net earned premiums underwriting loss our sbi runoff segment consists of large commercial business accounts and specialty programs that we have exited 
those accounts that do not fit with our focus on sbi regular or that cannot be effectively served within saf continue to be managed and reported in this segment 
net earned premiums net earned premiums were minimal in as we completed the runoff and included return premiums on retrospectively rated policies 
we determine ultimate premiums for retrospectively rated policies based on actual loss experience for the policy term 
this sometimes results in a return of premium to the policyholder at the end of the policy term 
net earned premiums in decreased by from  due to actions taken to exit this unprofitable business and renew certain policies into saf 
underwriting results and combined ratio the and underwriting losses include and of prior year workers compensation reserve strengthening 
more information about our workers compensation reserves is in the p c loss and lae reserves section on page we analyze our results in sbi runoff using underwriting profit loss 
that s due to the decreasing earned premiums associated with accounts in runoff which means combined ratio is less meaningful in assessing underwriting performance 

table of contents surety year ended december net earned premiums underwriting profit our surety segment provides surety bonds for construction and commercial businesses 
net earned premiums our net earned premiums increased in and in as a result of average rate increases of to beginning in and new business 
in  the increased new business was primarily driven by the opening of new offices in glendale  california and syracuse  new york 
underwriting results and combined ratio our combined ratios were in  in and in the improved combined ratio in reflects disciplined underwriting and rate increases combined with decreases in commission expense 
our underwriting results include a loss before reinsurance related to the bankruptcy of enron  net of reinsurance 
on january   we entered into a settlement agreement to end litigation involving the enron bankruptcy and related bond defaults 
driving our results the growth in our and premiums and underwriting profits resulted from disciplined underwriting resulting in lower loss ratios rate increases new business production where we re headed we are benefiting from the disarray in the surety market because we are a stable  long term provider of surety bonds 
some providers in the industry have experienced significant underwriting losses in recent years 
while was favorable for us in terms of obtaining increased rates  we expect to bring more modest rate increases 
we will maintain our disciplined underwriting approach as a priority while we grow this business 
p c other year ended december net earned premiums underwriting loss our p c other segment includes our runoff assumed reinsurance business acquired as part of the american states acquisition non voluntary personal lines business london operations that have been in runoff since the third quarter of charges affecting our results included increase to reserves for our london operations in and in in charges related to our decision to put the london operations into runoff 
table of contents to strengthen our reserves for construction defect and asbestos and environmental losses in in losses after reinsurance from the september  terrorist attacks p c impact of terrorism the terrorism risk insurance act of tria  enacted by the federal government on november   requires insurance companies to offer terrorism coverage to all commercial policyholders 
that includes workers compensation and surety policyholders 
tria does not apply to life insurance or personal lines policyholders 
us government funding under tria  the us government will provide funding to the insurance industry if a terrorist attack on behalf of a foreign interest causes losses of billion or more 
the funding will be provided on an aggregate basis of of covered losses in excess of individual insurance company deductibles of up to billion 
tria determines the deductibles for insurance companies as a percentage of their direct earned premiums 
our estimated deductible for is terrorism exclusions prior to the enactment of tria  our policies excluded losses due to foreign terrorism in states that had approved the exclusions 
with tria  we can no longer exclude losses due to foreign terrorism unless the policyholder rejects our mandatory offer of terrorism coverage 
the insurance services office iso created coverage and pricing tools to help insurers respond to the tria requirements 
if the policyholder does reject our mandatory offer of terrorism coverage  we can then exclude coverage for losses due to foreign terrorism 
the iso has filed exclusions for acts of terrorism as defined by tria  and we have adopted those filings 
however  some states limit the use of terrorism exclusions 
notifying policyholders tria required insurance companies to send notices to commercial policyholders by february  the notices had to include the offer of terrorism coverage and the cost for that coverage 
we sent out the required notices by that date 
reinsurance options the availability of terrorism reinsurance is limited in the commercial market 
our current reinsurance program provides limited terrorism coverage 
all reinsurance treaties exclude certified terrorist acts and also non certified terrorist acts involving nuclear  chemical  biological or radioactive materials 
the following treaties provide non certified terrorism coverage property catastrophe reinsurance covering of in excess of layer  workers compensation reinsurance covering in excess of layer  and our commercial and personal umbrella reinsurance 
our exposure is modest we believe our exposure to potential terrorism losses is relatively modest across all our product lines 
with commercial insurance  our focus is on small to medium sized businesses generally not viewed as likely potential terrorism targets 

table of contents with workers compensation policies  the number of employees covered is a key consideration 
we decline to provide coverage in cases where we believe the exposure is potentially severe 
with our personal lines of insurance  we believe that losses due to terrorism would likely be relatively modest 
we believe that exposure and risk to individuals are small 
we estimated our pretax losses net of reinsurance resulting from the september  terrorist attacks at  of which was reinsurance written through our london operation  for our business insurance accounts and for l i 
p c loss and loss adjustment expense reserves on pages and we described the critical accounting estimates involved in determining these reserves 
in this section  we provide the actual reserve estimates for the last three years and discuss changes in those estimates 
this table shows the changes in our p c loss and lae reserves for  and we record changes in estimated reserves in our consolidated statements of income loss the same year we make the change 
december loss and lae reserves at beginning of year less reinsurance recoverables net balance at beginning of year incurred loss and lae for claims occurring during current year prior years total incurred loss and lae loss and lae payments for claims occurring during current year prior years total loss and lae payments net balance at end of year plus reinsurance recoverables loss and lae reserves at end of year in  we increased our estimates for p c prior years loss and lae reserves by the total increase includes during the third quarter as a result of higher medical cost trends for workers compensation than previously expected 
in a number of lines at various times during the year due to emerging claim trends and related loss data 
payout periods for workers compensation claims can be years or more 
however  because we focus on low hazard risks  our average payout period is generally shorter than the industry average 
since  changes in our business have included improving our claims handling practices  putting greater emphasis on early recognition of exposure potential in case reserves 
table of contents focusing on the settlement of long term claims  increasing the number that we settle focusing our writings on small to medium sized businesses limiting our workers compensation writings in states where rate levels fall below our profitability targets while we expect these business changes to reduce our ultimate losses  they have decreased the predictive value of our past data in estimating future loss reserves 
with this in mind  in the second quarter of  we began performing additional actuarial analysis primarily focused on medical inflation trends and changes in safeco claim practices and mix of business 
this produced divergent indications 
as a consequence  in the third quarter of  we took additional steps to evaluate medical inflation trends  reviewing safeco and industry data our claim files loss reserve trends by state case reserving patterns and practices our analysis showed higher medical payouts than previously expected longer payout periods than previously expected relatively stable indemnity payouts based on our analysis  we increased our loss and lae reserves for workers compensation losses occurring in prior years by pretax during the third quarter of of this increase  was related to loss and allocated lae reserves 
this increase included in sbi runoff  in sbi regular and in sbi special accounts facility 
the largest amount of reserve development relates to california  particularly the large account business that we began exiting in we also increased unallocated lae reserves by pretax 
this increase included in sbi runoff  in sbi regular and in sbi special accounts facility 
this increase reflects our estimate of the ongoing expense of servicing workers compensation claims 
as claims remain open for longer periods of time  our costs to handle these claims rise 
in  we increased our estimates for p c prior years loss and lae reserves by we made increases throughout the year as part of our quarterly evaluations  based on emerging claim trends and related loss data 
the increase of included for construction defect claims for workers compensation losses for asbestos claims for other loss reserves the major factors driving our increases in loss reserves were construction defect claims legal costs were higher than estimated 
efforts to mitigate the severity levels of construction defect losses led to higher legal costs 

table of contents workers compensation losses the rate of medical cost inflation was higher than anticipated 
asbestos claims losses related to our participation in pools and syndicates were higher than estimated 
other reserves primarily higher than anticipated losses for our london operations that were put in runoff 
the losses are due to some high layer excess coverages and the long reporting lag of these operations 
in  we increased our estimates for prior years loss and lae reserves by we made that increase in two ways during the third quarter as a result of a review of our p c loss reserve adequacy at various times during the year due primarily to continued rising medical costs that affected our workers compensation losses the review of our p c loss reserve adequacy included an independent actuarial study 
the loss reserve increase by operating segment included for sbi regular for sbi runoff for p c other the p c other segment includes the runoff assumed reinsurance business that we acquired when we purchased american states in the loss reserve increase by coverage included for construction defect claims for workers compensation losses for other coverages  primarily asbestos the major factors driving our increases in loss reserves were construction defect claims newly reported claims increased significantly during the first half of the increase was due primarily to increased litigation in california and more claim activity in other states 
this occurred after claims appeared to have peaked in early and were trending down 
workers compensation losses unexpected prior year loss development and increases in medical costs at levels higher than previously anticipated asbestos claims in  the insurance industry was experiencing an expansion of asbestos claims to include smaller and more peripheral firms as defendants 
in the first half of  we experienced more claims than in prior years 
this led us to expect a larger number of asbestos claims affecting our runoff assumed reinsurance operations 
our l i operating results the primary measures of our l i operating results include revenues and pretax operating earnings 
the next two tables summarize revenues and pretax operating earnings by our reportable l i segments for the last three years 
more information about the results also by reportable segment follows the tables 

table of contents first  revenues include premiums  net investment income and fees 
revenues do not include our net realized investment gains and losses revenues year ended december group income annuities retirement services individual asset management l i other total l i revenues next  pretax operating earnings are our measure of each segment s profitability pretax operating earnings year ended december group income annuities retirement services individual asset management l i other pretax operating earnings net realized investment losses goodwill write off income from continuing operations before income taxes and change in accounting principle group year ended december revenues pretax operating earnings group s principal product is stop loss medical insurance sold to employers with self insured medical plans 
revenues our revenue increases in and were primarily due to our acquisition of swiss re s stop loss medical business in july and overall rate increases we implemented over the last two years 
pretax operating earnings the increases in our pretax operating earnings were primarily due to growth in revenues and earnings that resulted from the acquisition of swiss re s stop loss medical business and improved loss ratios 
our loss ratio improved to in  compared with in and in our rate increases were the primary drivers of the improved trend in our loss ratios 
a benefit from favorable loss reserve development related to policies obtained in the swiss re acquisition also contributed to our improved loss ratio in 
table of contents driving our results we continue to price for profitability and to grow our revenues only when we can do so profitably 
our loss experience has been unusually favorable in and due to both rate increases and lower claim experience 
the acquisition of swiss re s stop loss medical business contributed to both revenue and earnings growth in and income annuities year ended december revenues pretax operating earnings income annuities main product is structured settlement annuities  sold to fund third party personal injury settlements and long term claim settlements of our p c affiliates 
this product is extremely sensitive to financial strength ratings and our ratings downgrades in decreased our ability to sell this product 
income annuities also sells non structured fixed annuities  which provide an immediate payment stream 
revenues the decrease in revenues resulted mainly from the impact of lower favorable prepayment adjustments on our mortgage backed securities investment portfolio 
these prepayment adjustments totaled in compared with in favorable prepayment adjustments on these securities occur when interest rates decline and the underlying mortgage prepayments happen sooner than we estimated 
these prepayments  however  could also be unfavorable in the future if actual prepayments occur at a slower rate than anticipated 
despite ratings downgrades in  revenues remained flat in as a result of growth in our sales of non structured annuity products and the income from prepayment adjustments 
pretax operating earnings the decreases in pretax operating earnings in resulted from lower prepayment adjustments on our mortgage backed securities discussed above lower market interest rates on our new and reinvested assets driving our results high financial strength ratings are critical to our ability to market structured settlement annuities 
accordingly  our ratings downgrades in significantly limited our ability to sell them 
the majority of annuities are long term  years or longer  and are priced based upon investment return projections at the time of sale 
while we invest in longer term fixed maturities to match the duration of the annuities  when these investments are prepaid or are called the proceeds are generally reinvested at the then prevailing rate 
retirement services year ended december revenues pretax operating earnings retirement services principal products are fixed deferred annuities and variable annuities 

table of contents revenues we earn revenues relative to the amount of assets under management and the rate of return on these investments during the year 
the increase in revenues in was primarily due to higher investment income on our general account liabilities 
higher fee income on separate account liabilities  due to the improved performance of the equity markets in  also contributed to our increase in revenues 
these increases were partially offset by the impact of lower average interest rates on new and reinvested assets 
general account liabilities are amounts we owe to contract holders for products where we bear the investment risk  and include fixed deferred annuities and guaranteed investment contracts 
our general account liabilities have grown significantly 
they were  at year end  at year end  at year end that growth resulted principally from the launch of safeco secure fixed deferred annuity in and safeco select fixed deferred annuity in separate account liabilities are amounts we owe to contract holders for products where the contract holder bears the investment risk and has the right to allocate funds among various sub accounts 
they principally include variable annuities for which we hold matching separate account assets 
our separate account liabilities have fluctuated in a manner consistent with equity markets increases in and declines in they were  at year end at year end  at year end pretax operating earnings our pretax operating earnings declined slightly in despite our increased assets under management  due principally to an increase in certain operating expenses 
our pretax operating earnings increased in compared with due to growth in general account assets under management and lower losses from our equity indexed annuity product 
driving our results the profitability of our fixed and variable annuities depends on pricing our products at a margin over the cost of providing benefits and the expense of acquiring customers 
specifically fixed annuity profits depend on our returns on invested assets  net of the amounts we credit to policyholders accounts 
variable annuity profits depend on the amount of our assets under management and changes in their fair value  which affect the amount of fees we receive 
profitability for these products also depends on our persistency experience how long this business stays with us 
this affects our ability to recover the costs of acquiring new business over the lives of the contracts 
accordingly  if a contract owner withdraws funds during the early years of the contract usually during the first seven or eight years we keep a certain percentage of the withdrawal as a surrender charge  to recoup our acquisition costs 
some contracts allow us to pay the requested withdrawal out over five years 

table of contents in  we refiled fixed annuity products with our regulators in all states and obtained approval to lower our crediting rates in response to a decline in investment yields in all but three states 
at various times  we suspended sales of our products pending approval of these changes 
individual year ended december revenues pretax operating earnings individual s products include term  universal and variable universal life and bank owned life insurance boli 
our ratings downgrades in have significantly curtailed boli sales 
revenues the increases in revenues in and were due to our new web based sales tool and our updated term and universal life insurance products 
pretax operating earnings the decrease in pretax operating earnings in was primarily due to higher claims resulting from unfavorable mortality experience and lower margins on our boli products 
pretax operating earnings were down slightly compared with due primarily to less favorable mortality experience and decreased boli deposits 
there were no new boli deposits in  down from in and in driving our results we price our products based on mortality risk assumptions 
when our mortality experience differs from those assumptions  the claims experience affects our profitability 
for our boli products  financial strength ratings impact our ability to sell the product 
also  we can only change the interest credited on the policy anniversary date and are therefore susceptible to market fluctuations  which impact the margins on our boli products 
asset management year ended december revenues pretax operating earnings asset management serves as an investment advisor for safeco mutual funds  variable insurance portfolios and institutional and trust accounts

pretax investment income yields this table summarizes our pretax investment yields for the last three years year ended december p c l i the declines in our pretax investment yields in our portfolios reflected the low interest rate environment in and p c portfolio repositioning during  we repositioned our p c investment portfolio to better match expected asset and liability durations and to reduce risk and volatility 
in doing this  we reduced the average duration of the bonds we hold  primarily by shifting from long term tax exempt bonds to shorter term taxable bonds 
in addition  we shifted our asset allocation mix to reduce the amount of equity securities we hold

these calls issuers redeeming bonds in which we ve invested before the final maturity date are an expected part of our investment activity  particularly when interest rates are low 
net gains on securities transactions in resulted primarily from the repositioning of our portfolio

substantially all of the mortgage loans are held by our l i business as of december  our mortgage loans are on completed  income producing commercial real estate  primarily in the retail  industrial and office building sectors 
the majority of the properties on which we hold mortgages are in three states in washington in california in oregon we hold mortgages in no other state that represents greater than of the mortgage loan balance 
our mortgage loans follow these guidelines no loan when issued shall exceed of the property s appraised value individual loans generally do not exceed first mortgage liens secure the loans our mortgage portfolio has historically performed well  with a low loan charge off rate 
our loan charge off rate was less than in  and 
table of contents less than of our mortgage loans were non performing those loans in default of principal or interest or both at the end of each of the last two years 
as a result  our allowance for mortgage loan losses has remained relatively unchanged at at december   compared with at december  mortgage backed securities our mortgage backed securities consist mainly of residential collateralized mortgage obligations cmos  pass throughs and commercial mortgage backed securities cmbss

table of contents here are the quality ratings of our mortgage backed securities portfolio at year end rating percent at december  government agency backed aaa aa a bbb bb or lower total capital resources and liquidity our liquidity needs our liquidity needs vary according to our principal products 
p c liabilities are somewhat unpredictable and generally short in duration 
the payments we make to policyholders depend upon losses they suffer from accidents or other unpredictable events 
while we can estimate fairly well how much cash we ll need and when we ll need it  we cannot predict all future events  particularly catastrophes 
so we use investments with greater liquidity investments that can quickly be turned into cash to support our p c businesses need for funds 
life insurance  retirement services and other annuity product reserves are primarily longer duration liabilities that are typically predictable in nature and are matched with investments that are generally longer duration and less liquid 
sources of our funds we get cash from insurance premiums  funds received under deposit contracts  dividends  interest and asset management fees  sales or maturity of investments and debt and equity offerings 
we have not engaged in the sale of investments or other assets by securitization 
the cash flow from our operating activities for the past three years was  in in in the main reason for the increase in operating cash flows was improved underwriting results in personal auto  homeowners and sbi regular 
the main reasons for the improved operating cash flow in compared with were lower p c claims payments  resulting from lower catastrophe and weather losses  as well as the effect of our reunderwriting efforts and rate increases that began in the higher level of proceeds from the sale of fixed maturities and equity securities  and the higher level of purchases of fixed maturities in compared with  arose from our portfolio repositioning discussed above 
in addition  the relatively high level of proceeds from the maturity of fixed maturities in all three years reflects the high number of calls of fixed maturities and prepayments of mortgage backed securities 
these calls and prepayments were triggered by the low interest rate environment during the past three years and issuer driven actions 
we believe that cash flow from our operations  investment portfolio and bank credit facility are sufficient to meet our future liquidity needs 

table of contents how we use our funds we use funds to support operations  make interest and principal payments on debt  pay dividends to our shareholders and grow our investment portfolio 
we use cash from insurance operations primarily to pay claims and claim adjustment expenses 
we require insurance premiums to be paid in advance 
as a result  cash flows into our business before or at the time premium revenues are recognized 
cash flows out of our business in subsequent months or years as claims are paid 
our capital structure long term debt refinancing on january   we issued of senior notes  including of senior notes at an interest rate of that mature in of senior notes at an interest rate of that mature in we used the proceeds as follows to pay off notes that had a interest rate and were due march  to pay off notes that had a interest rate and were due in  but had a call date at par of april  common stock offering on november   we raised by selling  shares of our common stock at per share 
we used the proceeds as follows to support our p c operations to support our l i operations the balance for general corporate purposes in our business operations  the proceeds were used to support future growth in our core product lines and to strengthen the capital base of these operations 
long term debt issuance on august   we issued of senior notes at an interest rate of 
the notes mature in we used the proceeds as follows to pay off our commercial paper borrowings to terminate related interest rate swaps to repay our medium term notes the balance for general corporate purposes at the same time  we entered into a notional interest rate swap 
this converted our fixed rate into a libor based floating rate obligation 
we marked to market the fair value of the interest rate swap and we included the fair value of the interest rate swap on the other invested assets line of our consolidated balance sheets 
our bank credit facility we maintain a bank credit facility with available 
the terms of the bank credit facility which runs through september require us to pay a fee to have these funds available 
table of contents maintain a specified minimum level of shareholders equity keep our debt to capitalization ratio below a specified maximum the bank credit facility does not require us to maintain any deposits as compensating balances 
at the end of and throughout  we had no borrowings under the bank credit facility and we were in compliance with all its covenants 
after the sale of l i  we may lower the bank credit facility and we would seek a reset of the requirement to maintain minimum shareholders equity 
we would continue to keep our debt to capitalization ratio below the maximum requirement using proceeds from the sale of l i to reduce debt to a level consistent with our ratios prior to the sale 
our contractual obligations our contractual obligations at the end of were payment by contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt including interest operating leases pension obligations purchase obligations total contractual obligations more information about our contractual obligations is in notes and to our consolidated financial statements on pages and we excluded loss and lae reserves and funds held under deposit contracts from the above table 
the loss and lae reserves amounted to  and the funds held under deposit contracts amounted to  on our consolidated balance sheet at december  the timing of actual claims and benefit payments related to these reserves varies based on catastrophes  mortality and morbidity rates  surrender and lapse rates  as well as market conditions 
the ultimate amount of claims and benefit payments could also differ from our estimated reserves 
off balance sheet arrangements our off balance sheet arrangements are as follows in april  safeco corporation issued a letter of credit to citibank on behalf of safeco uk  ltd 
safeco uk  our wholly owned subsidiary 
safeco uk conducted our london operations that were put into runoff in the third quarter of the letter of credit guarantees payment of safeco uk s share of potential losses up to arising from prior participation in a london reinsurance syndicate 
prior to april  this guarantee was provided by safeco insurance company of america sica  a wholly owned subsidiary of safeco corporation 
in june  safeco life insurance company safeco life  our wholly owned subsidiary  issued a guarantee to general america corporation gac  our wholly owned subsidiary 
under the guarantee  safeco life guarantees repayment of a loan made by gac to investar holdings  an insurance agency 
the loan was made in june and matures in june the principal balance of is included with other notes and accounts receivable on the consolidated balance sheets 

table of contents in  sica issued a guarantee to the bank of new york on behalf of market square real estate  inc market square a limited liability company in which sica was an investor 
the guarantee covers the repayment of of municipal bonds issued by the city of minneapolis 
the proceeds from the bond issuance were then loaned to market square 
in  sica sold its interest in market square but remained a guarantor for the repayment of the bonds 
as a condition to the sale  market square granted sica a first mortgage on its assets  as security  for any payments sica may make pursuant to the guarantee 
the repayment of the loan made to market square by the city of minneapolis will fund the scheduled repayment of the bonds in sica has not made any payments pursuant to the guarantee 
financial strength ratings financial strength ratings provide a benchmark for comparing insurers 
higher ratings generally indicate greater financial strength and a stronger ability to pay claims 
claims paying ratings are important for the marketing of insurance products  particularly structured settlement annuities and boli products in our l i operations 
here are our current ratings am best fitch moody s standard poor s safeco corporation senior debt bbb a baa bbb financial strength p c subsidiaries a aa a a life subsidiaries a aa a a we believe our financial position is sound 
as we have continued to execute our plans to improve p c operating results  our financial position has strengthened 
our debt service coverage has improved over the last two years  and we expect that to continue 
factors that determine financial strength ratings in determining financial strength ratings  the rating agencies focus on results of operations capital resources debt to capital ratio management expertise marketing investment operations minimum policyholders surplus requirements capital sufficiency to meet projected growth access to capital impact of financial strength ratings lower financial strength ratings could materially and adversely affect our company and its performance and could increase the number of customers who terminate their policies inhibit our distributors willingness and ability to sell our products  particularly l i products decrease new sales increase our borrowing costs limit our access to capital 
table of contents restrict our ability to compete due to our poor p c results in and  our financial strength and corporate credit ratings were lowered in the first half of the lower results in and  combined with increased operating leverage in p c  contributed to lowering our debt service coverage 
in addition  the interest rate on our short term borrowings increased due to the ratings downgrades 
on august   standard poor s s p affirmed its ratings on safeco corporation and our p c subsidiaries 
at the same time  s p lowered its ratings on our life insurance subsidiaries because of a change in s p group methodology criteria  which modified the rating available to subsidiaries 
the new criteria generally limit the rating given to a subsidiary that s p deems strategically important to the parent to within one notch of the rating on the parent s core group 
on december   am best reaffirmed our ratings and revised its outlook for our corporate and p c ratings from negative to stable 
our l i businesses on september   we announced our intent to sell our l i businesses 
until a buyer is announced  the rating agencies cannot fully evaluate the effect if any on the factors they will consider in determining financial strength ratings 
as a result  the rating agencies took these actions concerning our l i businesses am best and fitch placed the financial strength ratings of our life insurance subsidiaries under review with developing implications 
moody s downgraded the financial strength rating of safeco life insurance company with direction uncertain 
s p s lowered its ratings on our life insurance subsidiaries with developing implications 
am best and fitch commented that our debt ratings  as well as the financial strength ratings of our p c subsidiaries  are unaffected 
s p s and moody s affirmed their ratings of safeco corporation and our p c subsidiaries  with a stable outlook 
regulatory issues there are no recently passed or recommendations calling for regulations that would materially affect liquidity  capital resources or results of operations 
a number of state legislatures and insurance regulatory agencies have enacted laws and regulations that limit the use of credit information in the underwriting process 
additional states are considering doing so 
our p c businesses use insurance scoring which is partially based on credit information in making risk selection and pricing decisions 
limitations or prohibitions on the use of credit information could negatively affect our p c business plans 
dividend payments from our subsidiaries our insurance subsidiaries pay dividends to safeco corporation 
we then use those funds to pay dividends to our shareholders  as well as to make principal and interest payments on our debt 
individual states limit the amount of dividends that our subsidiaries domiciled in those states can pay us 
exceeding such limits would require prior regulatory approval 
in  our p c insurance subsidiaries can pay up to in dividends and our l i insurance subsidiaries can pay up to in dividends without obtaining prior regulatory approval 
these amounts are according to the limits states had in place at the end of 
table of contents risk based capital the national association of insurance commissioners naic uses risk based capital rbc formulas for both property and casualty insurers and life insurers 
the rbc formulas are used by the naic and state regulators to identify companies that are undercapitalized and that may merit further regulatory attention or action 
our insurance subsidiaries have more than sufficient capital to meet rbc requirements 
income taxes at december   we had approximately  of gross deferred income tax assets 
gross deferred income tax assets are composed of temporary differences created as a result of amounts deductible for taxes in future periods 
these deferred income tax assets included net operating loss carryforwards of that will expire in and a net operating loss carryforward is a tax loss that may be carried forward into future years 
it reduces taxable income  and as a result  tax liability 
realization of gross deferred income tax assets we believe it is more likely than not that our gross deferred income tax assets will be realized through our future earnings 
as a result  we have not recorded a valuation allowance 
we used the same assumptions and projections as in our internal financial projections to estimate our future taxable income 
these projections are subject to uncertainties primarily related to the variability of our p c underwriting results 
if our results are not as profitable as expected  we may have to record a valuation allowance for our gross deferred income tax assets 
doing that would reduce our earnings 

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk disclosures for financial instruments the following table shows the fair values of certain of our financial instruments on our consolidated balance sheets at december  and to analyze the sensitivity of our financial instruments to changes in interest rates and equity prices  we show in the second column in the table for each year the effect a basis point increase in market interest rates would have on the fair values 
in the third column for each year we show the effect a decline in equity prices would have on fair values december increase decrease in asset or liability increase decrease in asset or liability fair value change in interest rates change in equity prices fair value change in interest rates change in equity prices financial assets fixed maturities marketable equity securities mortgage loans cash and cash equivalents short term investments other notes and accounts receivable separate account assets derivative financial instruments interest rate swaps options futures financial liabilities funds held under deposit contracts medium term notes due notes due notes due notes due notes due notes due debentures due other debt separate account liabilities derivative financial instruments sfp credit default swaps interest rate swaps options futures market risk is our potential loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
in addition to market risk  we are exposed to other risks  including credit risk related to our financial instruments underlying insurance risk related to our core businesses 
table of contents the sensitivity analysis used for the table summarizes only the market risk related to our recorded financial assets and liabilities 
we manage market risk by matching the projected cash inflows of our assets with the projected cash outflows of our liabilities for our investment and financial products including annuities and other retirement services products 
we seek to maintain reasonable average durations for all of our financial assets and liabilities 
we try to maximize income without sacrificing investment quality while providing for liquidity and diversification 
we use certain derivative financial instruments to increase our matching of cash flows 
for example  we buy s p call option contracts and futures to economically hedge the liability of our l i equity indexed annuity eia product 
we calculate the estimated fair values at the adjusted market rates by using discounted cash flow analysis and duration modeling  where appropriate 
the adjusted market rates assume a basis point increase in market interest rates 
the estimated values do not consider the effect that changing interest rates could have on prepayment activity of products like cmos and annuities 
this sensitivity analysis provides only a limited  point in time view of the market risk of the financial instruments discussed above 
the actual impact of market interest rate and price changes on the financial instruments may differ significantly from those shown in this sensitivity analysis 
the sensitivity analysis is further limited because it does not consider any actions we could take in response to actual and or anticipated changes in interest rates and equity prices 
also  guidance for these disclosures does not require certain financial instruments like policy loans to be included in the sensitivity analysis 
in addition  the sensitivity analysis excludes certain non financial instruments such as insurance liabilities 
accordingly  any aggregation of the estimated fair value amounts or adjusted fair value amounts does not equal the underlying fair value of net equity
