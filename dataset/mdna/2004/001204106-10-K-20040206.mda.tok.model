item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations summary the following section is a brief summary of the significant issues addressed in management s discussion and analysis 
investors should read the relevant sections of management s discussion and analysis and the financial statements for a complete discussion of the issues summarized below 
results of operations o our net income increased million or over with basic and diluted earnings per share of and as compared to and in for an increase of or 
o the increase in earnings is primarily from increased earnings before interest and taxes ebit of million and reduced interest expense of million or  offset by an increase in income tax of million due to increased earnings before income taxes of million and a higher projected effective tax rate for o improved earnings from distribution operations  southstar energy services llc southstar and sequent energy management  lp sequent primarily drove the increase in ebit o distribution operations contributed ebit of million compared to a ebit contribution of million 
excluding a net million pretax gain on the sale of our former corporate headquarters at our caroline street campus and a charitable donation  distribution operations ebit for was million  a increase over the increase was primarily due to higher operating margins at virginia natural gas company  inc vng driven by higher customer usage and an increase in the number of connected customers 
the increase in atlanta gas light company s aglc operating margin was from increased pipeline replacement revenues 
total operating expenses  excluding the cost of gas  for were million compared to million in the increase in operating expenses reflects higher overhead costs  including an increase in building l ease expenses 
o wholesale services contributed million in ebit for the year compared to million in  a increase 
the earnings improvement resulted primarily from increased activity related to optimization of transportation and storage assets and increased commodity margins  particularly in the first quarter of when sequent sold substantially all its inventory 
sequent s results also were impacted by emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 issues involved in accounting for contracts under eitf issue no 
 accounting for contracts involved in energy trading and risk management activities eitf  which rescinded eitf and resulted in inventory  which was previously recorded on a mark to market basis  to be recorded on an accrual basis 
this resulted in a change in accounting principle for a cumulative effect of million or basic earnings per common share 
o energy investments contributed million in ebit in compared to million in  an increase 
southstar accounted for the majority of the segment s improved results 
southstar s improvement resulted primarily from higher operating margins and reduced bad debt and operating expenses  as well as our increased ownership percentage from to in the joint venture 
results at southstar also reflect the settlement of the disproportionate sharing of earnings with piedmont natural gas company piedmont in the fourth quarter 
the agreement resulted in our recognition of an additional million of equity earnings for the months ended december   and resolves all outstanding issues related to disproportionate sharing between the two partners in southstar 
o we closed on the sale of our caroline street campus for net proceeds of million  resulting in a gain before income taxes of million 
we contributed million of these proceeds to the agl resources private foundation  inc  a nonprofit foundation that makes charitable contributions to qualified tax exempt organizations 
this gain net of the donation increased our basic earnings per share from by an additional 
excluding the gain  our basic earnings per share for was  an increase of or over the gain before income taxes of million was recorded as operating income loss in two of our segments 
a gain of million on the sale of the land was recorded in distribution operations  and a write off of million on the buildings and their contents was recorded in our corporate segment 
o our operating cash flow in was million  a decrease of million from this decrease was primarily the result of increased spending for injection of natural gas inventories of approximately billion cubic feet bcf 
the weighted average cost of our inventory was approximately higher than last year 
in addition  we made million in pension contributions in as a result of our continued efforts to fully fund our pension liability 
the increased spending on inventories and pension funding was partially offset by increased net income of million and cash received from southstar of million 
liquidity and capital resources o we ended with a stronger balance sheet  as measured by debt to total capitalization and improved liquidity  as measured by cash and availability under our credit facility 
primarily through a million equity offering of million shares and adding million of earnings  we increased common equity from million at december  to million at december  o we also reduced total debt outstanding from  million at december  to  million at december  as a result  our debt to capitalization ratio decreased from at december  to at december  liquidity improved from million at december  to million at december  our balance sheet and cash flow improvements enabled us to raise our shareholder dividend 
we now pay an indicated annualized dividend of per share  a increase over the previous per share 
o we currently have an active shelf registration statement for up to million of various capital securities  with remaining capacity of approximately million 
on september   we filed a second shelf registration with the securities and exchange commission sec for authority to increase our capacity to billion of various capital securities 
other activities o at the beginning of  we announced our purchase of dynegy inc s dynegy s ownership interest in southstar for million 
this increase in ownership provided an additional million of other income in o we formed pivotal energy development pivotal to identify opportunities to extend our natural gas delivery capabilities while improving system reliability 
two such opportunities have been identified to date a propane air plant in virginia  which is currently in the regulatory approval and permitting stages  and a pipeline project between atlanta and macon  georgia to enhance access to a liquefied natural gas lng facility we have there 
the construction phase of the macon project is planned for  pending redeployment of certain existing interstate pipeline infrastructure 
results of operations our management evaluates segment financial performance based on ebit  which includes the effects of corporate expense allocations 
items that are not included in ebit are financing costs  including interest and debt expense  income taxes and the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles 
we evaluate each of these items on a consolidated level 
we believe ebit is a useful measurement of our performance because it provides information that can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of our businesses from an operational perspective  exclusive of the costs to finance those activities and exclusive of income taxes  neither of which is directly relevant to the efficiency of those operations 
operating margin is a non gaap measure of income  calculated as revenues minus cost of gas and cost of sales  excluding operation and maintenance expense  depreciation and amortization  taxes other than income taxes and the gain on the sale of our caroline street campus 
these items are included in our calculation of operating income 
we believe operating margin is a better indicator than revenues of the top line contribution resulting from customer growth  since cost of gas is generally passed directly to our customers 
you should not consider operating margin or ebit an alternative to  or a more meaningful indicator of our operating performance than  operating income or net income as determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
in addition  our operating margin or ebit may not be comparable to a similarly titled measure of another company 
the following is a reconciliation of our operating margin to operating income and a reconciliation of ebit to earnings before income taxes and net income  on a consolidated basis for  and fiscal we changed our year end from september to december  effective october  results of operations discussions for the transition period the three months ending december  are included separately in this annual report

ebit from distribution operations excluding the net gain on the sale of the caroline street campus of million  discussed below increased million vs 
million due to higher operating margins  an increase in the number of connected customers and increased pipeline replacement revenue in wholesale services contributed million in ebit compared to million in the earnings improvement resulted primarily from sequent s optimization of various transportation and storage assets and increased physical volumes sold as well as increased margins driven by favorable pricing and market volatility  particularly in the first quarter of energy investments contributed million in ebit compared to million in southstar accounted for the majority of the increase  and its results were driven primarily by higher operating margins  reduced bad debt expense  our expanded ownership interest in the business and the resolution of the disproportionate sharing issue with piedmont 
our corporate segment s expenses decreased primarily as a result of favorable interest expense and lower average debt balances

compared to fiscal the decrease in interest expense of million for as compared to fiscal was a result of lower interest rates on commercial paper and the effect of favorable fixed to floating interest rate swaps  offset by slightly higher average debt balances due to increases in working capital needs 
distribution operations distribution operations includes the results of operations and financial condition of our three natural gas local distribution utility companies aglc  vng and chattanooga gas company cgc 
distribution operations revenues contributed of our consolidated revenues for  for  for the transition period and for fiscal each utility operates subject to regulations provided by the state regulatory agencies in its service territories 
o aglc is a natural gas local distribution utility with distribution systems and related facilities throughout georgia 
aglc has approximately bcf of lng storage capacity in three lng plants to supplement the supply of natural gas during peak usage periods 
pursuant to the georgia natural gas competition and deregulation act  aglc is designated as an electing distribution company  which means that aglc is required to offer lng peaking services to marketers that is  marketers who are certificated by the georgia public service commission gpsc to sell retail natural gas in georgia at rates and on terms approved by the gpsc 
performance based rates aglc operates under a three year performance based rate pbr plan that became effective may   with an allowed return on equity of 
the pbr plan also establishes an earnings band based on a return on equity of to  with three quarters of any earnings above a return on equity shared with georgia customers and one quarter retained by aglc 
in the last year of the pbr plan may april  the gpsc staff and aglc will review the operation of the plan and review aglc s revenue requirement to determine whether base rates should be reset upon the initial plan s expiration 
the gpsc will then determine whether the plan should be discontinued  extended or otherwise modified 
as part of any hearing procedure  aglc will file a cost of service study in accordance with the gpsc s minimum filing requirements as well as supporting testimony 
aglc plans to file the required cost of service study in  the precise timing of which is subject to discussions with the gpsc staff 
straight fixed variable rates aglc s revenue is recognized under a straight fixed variable rate design  whereby aglc charges rates to its customers based primarily on a fixed charge 
this minimizes the seasonality of both revenues and expenses since the fixed charge is not volumetric and therefore not directly weather dependent 
weather indirectly influences the number of customers that have active accounts during the heating season  and this has a seasonal impact on aglc s revenues  since generally more customers will be connected in periods of colder weather than in periods of warmer weather 
o vng is a natural gas local distribution utility with distribution systems and related facilities serving the region of southeastern virginia 
vng owns and operates approximately miles of a separate high pressure pipeline that provides delivery of gas to customers under firm transportation agreements within the state of virginia 
vng also has approximately five million gallons of propane storage capacity in its two propane facilities to supplement the supply of natural gas during peak usage periods 
weather normalization adjustment on september   the virginia state corporation commission vscc approved a weather normalization adjustment wna program as a two year experiment involving the use of special rates 
the wna program s purpose is to reduce the effect of weather on customer bills by reducing bills when winter weather is colder than normal and increasing bills when winter weather is warmer than normal 
under the terms of the program  if vng requests to continue the wna program after the two year experiment  it is required to file a fully adjusted cost of service study along with the same schedules as would be required for a general rate case 
it is possible the vscc may require a general rate case prior to extending the wna program 
vng plans to request an extension of the wna program in o cgc is a natural gas local distribution utility with distribution systems and related facilities serving the chattanooga and cleveland areas of tennessee 
cgc has approximately bcf of lng storage capacity in its lng plant 
included in the base rates charged by cgc is a wna factor that allows for revenue to be recognized based on a weather normalization factor derived from average temperatures over a year period  which offsets the impact of unusually cold or warm weather on its operating income 
on january   cgc filed a request for a total rate increase of million with the tennessee regulatory authority tra  as rates have not increased since if approved  new rates would be effective march   subject to a tra suspension for hearing 
the rate plan was filed to cover cgc s rising cost of providing natural gas to its customers 
pivotal energy development in  we announced the formation of pivotal to coordinate  among our related companies  the development  construction or acquisition of assets in the southeast and mid atlantic regions to extend our natural gas capabilities and improve system reliability while enhancing service to our customers in those areas 
o virginia in  pivotal intends to complete the construction of a propane facility in the vng service territory 
a filing with the vscc was made in november seeking approval for an affiliate contract between pivotal and vng 
under this proposed contract  pivotal would provide vng with  dekatherms of propane air per day on a day per year basis to serve its peaking needs 
construction of the facility by pivotal is contingent upon the vscc s approval of the contract between pivotal and vng  and we expect its decision during the first quarter of o georgia pivotal is currently evaluating a pipeline project between atlanta and macon to enhance access to our lng facility and lower the cost of gas to our customers 
the construction phase of the macon project is planned for  pending redeployment of certain existing interstate pipeline infrastructure 
gas supply gas supply or capacity planning is conducted for each of our regulated jurisdictions 
the basic premise of a capacity plan is to evaluate the costs of alternative asset arrays meeting firm customer demand for natural gas under varying weather conditions that exist in our service territories 
on an annual basis the array of assets for each utility must have adequate interstate transportation  underground storage and lng capacity to meet firm customer demand if the weather is colder than normal  and must be flexible enough to adjust for firm customer demand in a winter that is warmer than normal 
rates and regulation the gpsc regulates aglc  the vscc regulates vng  and the tra regulates cgc with respect to rates charged to our customers  maintenance of accounting records and various other service and safety matters 
rates charged to our customers vary according to customer class residential  commercial or industrial and rate jurisdiction 
rates are set at levels that allow for the recovery of all prudently incurred costs  including a return on rate base sufficient to pay interest on debt  pay preferred dividends and provide a reasonable return on common equity 
rate base consists generally of the original cost of utility plant in service  working capital  inventories and certain other assets  less accumulated depreciation on utility plant in service  net deferred income tax liabilities and certain other deductions 
we continuously monitor the performance of our utilities to determine whether rates need to be adjusted by making a rate filing 
the following table depicts the currently authorized and estimated rates of return for aglc  vng and cgc authorized return on rate base authorized return on equity estimated jurisdictional return on equity aglc vng cgc state activity since  a number of federal and state proceedings have addressed the role of aglc to administer and assign interstate assets to marketers pursuant to the provisions of the natural gas competition and deregulation act of georgia 
most recently  aglc entered into a stipulation with the gpsc staff  industrial customers  the governor s office of consumer affairs and all but one of the marketers using its systems regarding the assignment of its interstate capacity assets 
a hearing to approve the stipulation was held  and on july   the gpsc unanimously approved the stipulation 
under the approved terms  aglc is authorized to offer two additional sales services pursuant to gpsc approved tariffs  and acquire and continue managing the interstate transportation and storage contracts that underlie the sales services provided to marketers on its distribution system under gpsc approved tariffs 
federal activity the pipeline safety improvement act of  enacted on december   required the office of pipeline safety ops to establish new regulations for the inspection of transmission pipelines by december the ops issued its final rules in december the ops rules will require our three utility subsidiaries to inspect and take remedial action on approximately miles of our large diameter pipelines with an initial estimated cost over a year period of million in maintenance expense 
we believe that since the efforts that require these expenditures are federally mandated the costs will be recoverable from customers 
on january   vng filed a complaint with the federal energy regulatory commission ferc against columbia gas transmission columbia  a subsidiary of nisource inc among other things  the complaint alleges that during last winter s heating season  beginning in january  vng experienced a number of critical service problems with columbia that interrupted deliveries of natural gas to some industrial customers and increased prices paid by vng s customers 
vng is seeking approximately million in damages  the majority of which would be distributed to vng s customers 
competition our distribution operations businesses face competition based on our customers preferences for natural gas compared to other energy products and the comparative prices of those products 
our principal competition relates to the electric utilities serving the residential and small commercial markets throughout our service areas and the potential displacement or replacement of natural gas appliances with electric appliances 
the primary competitive factors are the price of energy and the comfort of natural gas heating versus electric heating 
also  price volatility in the wholesale natural gas commodity market has resulted in increases in the cost of natural gas billed to customers 
competition for space heating and general household and small commercial energy needs generally occurs at the initial installation phase when the customer builder typically makes decisions as to which types of equipment to install and operate 
the customer will generally continue to use the chosen energy source for the life of the equipment 
we believe that our consumers continuing preference for natural gas allows us to maintain a strong market presence 
however  our customers demand for natural gas and the level of business of natural gas assets could be affected by numerous factors  including o changes in the availability or price of natural gas and other forms of energy o general economic conditions o energy conservation o legislation and regulations o the capability to convert from natural gas to alternative fuels o weather customer profile distribution operations primarily serves residential customers  as shown in the following table aglc vng cgc residential commercial and industrial total in  our net customer growth was approximately 
while we experienced positive net growth  it has been limited due to the number of customers who choose to leave our systems 
we expect our net customer growth to improve in the future through our efforts in o new business add residential customers with three or more appliances burner tips  multifamily complexes  and we continue to seek high value commercial customers that use natural gas for purposes other than space heating 
o retention partner with numerous entities  including appliance retailers  hvac dealers  plumbers  realtors and natural gas marketers to market the benefits of gas appliances and to identify early in the process those customers who may opt to leave our franchise or convert to alternative fuels 
results of operations the results of operations for distribution operations are as follows in millions calendar calendar fiscal vs

operating revenues cost of gas operating margin operation and maintenance expenses depreciation and amortization taxes other than income total operating expenses gain on sale of caroline street campus operating income donation to private foundation other income total other loss income ebit metrics average end use customers in thousands operation and maintenance expenses per customer ebit per customer customers per employee throughput in millions of dekatherms firm interruptible total heating degree days georgia virginia tennessee ebit per customer excludes the gain on the sale of our caroline street campus 
we measure the effects of weather on our businesses using degree days 
the measure of degree days for a given day is the difference between the average daily actual temperature and the baseline temperature of degrees fahrenheit 
heating degree days result when the average daily actual temperature is less than the degree baseline 
generally  increased heating degree days result in greater demand for gas on our distribution systems 
compared to ebit increased million for as compared to  primarily as a result of the gain of million on the sale of the land from our caroline street campus  offset by the million donation to agl resources private foundation  inc excluding the gain and donation  ebit increased million from improved operations as a result of increased operating margin  partially offset by increased operating expenses 
operating margin increased million from this was primarily from an increased number of customers and a higher usage per degree day  of which vng contributed approximately million 
pipeline replacement program prp rider revenues increased million  resulting from recovery of prior year program expenses 
carrying costs charged to marketers for gas stored underground also contributed million due to higher storage volumes 
offsetting the increases was a reduction in aglc s rates as compared to prior year of million for the first four months of due to the pbr settlement agreement with the gpsc effective may  cgc s operating margin for was not materially different from operating expenses increased million from due primarily to a million increase in corporate allocated costs related to an increase in corporate building lease costs and higher general business insurance premiums 
bad debt expenses increased million  primarily as a result of colder than normal weather and higher natural gas prices 
additional increases in operating expenses were attributed to a million vng regulatory asset write off in these increases in operating expenses were partially offset by a million decrease in depreciation expenses due to lower depreciation rates at aglc for the first four months of as a result of the pbr settlement agreement with the gpsc 
compared to fiscal the increase in ebit of million for compared to fiscal was primarily due to decreases in operating expenses of million  partially offset by decreases in operating margin of million 
operating margin decreased million primarily due to the following o vng s operating margin decreased million  resulting from the impact of warmer than normal winter weather of million  partially offset by a million increase in customers and the positive impact of an experimental wna program that went into effect for the billing cycle beginning november o cgc s operating margin decreased million  primarily due to lower use per customer 
o aglc s operating margin decreased million  primarily due to a million decrease in aglc s rates as a result of the pbr settlement with the gpsc  and a decrease of million as a result of a decline in the number of customers due to fewer end use customers connecting to our system 
additional decreases to aglc margin were a million one time adjustment in to cost of gas as a result of inventory cost for natural gas stored underground 
these decreases were offset by an million increase in aglc s prp rider revenues resulting from recovery of prior year program expenses  and an increase in carrying costs charged to marketers for gas stored underground that contributed an additional million 
operating expenses decreased million primarily due to the following o operation and maintenance expenses decreased million related to reductions in payroll and contract costs as a result of implementing cost efficiencies 
o bad debt expenses decreased million as a result of higher than normal bad debt expense in fiscal due to colder than normal weather and higher than normal gas prices  resulting in higher customer bills during the heating season 
o goodwill amortization decreased million from as a result of the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  effective october  o depreciation expense decreased million in as compared to fiscal  due to a decrease of million caused by a decline in average depreciation rates from to as a result of aglc s pbr settlement with the gpsc effective may   partially offset by an increase in depreciation expenses of million due to higher property  plant and equipment balances 
wholesale services wholesale services includes the results of operations and financial condition of sequent  our subsidiary involved in asset optimization  producer services  wholesale marketing and risk management 
our asset optimization business focuses on capturing value from idle or underutilized natural gas assets  which are typically amassed by companies via investments in or contractual rights to natural gas transportation and storage assets 
margin is typically created in this business by participating in transactions that balance the needs of varying markets and time horizons 
asset management transactions our asset management customers include our affiliated local distribution companies ldcs  nonaffiliated utilities  municipal customers and industrial customers 
these customers must contract for transportation and storage services to meet their peak day demands  and typically contract for these services on a day basis even though they may only need these services to meet their peak demands for a much shorter period 
we enter into agreements with these customers  either through contract assignment or agency arrangement  whereby we use their rights to transportation and storage services during off peak periods 
we capture margin by optimizing the purchase  transportation  storage and sale of natural gas  and typically either share profits with customers or pay a fee for using utility assets 
regulatory agreements we have reached the following agreements with state regulatory commissions to clarify sequent s role as asset manager for our regulated utilities 
failure to renew these agreements would have a significant impact on sequent s ebit 
o in november  the vscc approved an asset management agreement that provides for a sharing of profits between sequent and vng s customers 
this agreement expires in october  unless sequent  vng and the vscc agree to extend the contract 
o various georgia statutes require sequent  as asset manager for aglc  to share of its earnings from capacity release transactions with georgia s universal service fund usf 
a december gpsc order requires net margin earned by sequent  for transactions involving aglc assets other than capacity release  to be shared equally with the usf 
o in june  cgc s tariff was amended effective january  to require all net margin earned by sequent for transactions involving cgc assets to be shared equally with cgc ratepayers 
this agreement expires in april and is subject to automatic extensions unless specifically terminated by either party 
from may to december  sequent operated under a bailment agreement and annually paid million to manage cgc s assets 
transportation and storage transactions in our wholesale marketing and risk management business  we also contract for our own transportation and storage services 
we participate in transactions to manage the natural gas commodity and transportation costs that result in the lowest cost to serve our various markets 
we then seek to optimize this process on a daily basis as market conditions change by evaluating all the natural gas supplies  transportation and markets to which we have access and seek out the least cost alternatives to serve our various markets 
this enables us to capture geographic pricing differences across these various markets as delivered gas prices change 
in a similar manner  we participate in natural gas storage transactions where we seek to identify pricing differences that occur over time as prices for future delivery periods at many locations are readily available 
we capture margin by locking in the economic price differential between purchasing natural gas at the lowest future price and  in a related transaction  selling that gas at the highest future price  all within the constraints of our contracts 
through the use of transportation and storage services  we are able to capture margin through the arbitrage of geographical pricing differences and by recognizing pricing differences that occur over time 
producer services our producer services business primarily focuses on aggregating natural gas supply from various small and medium sized producers located throughout the natural gas production areas of the united states 
we provide the producers certain logistical and risk management services that offer them attractive options to move their supply into the pipeline grid 
aggregating volumes of natural gas from these producers allows us to provide markets to producers who seek a reliable outlet for their natural gas production 
peaking services wholesale services generates operating margin through the sale of peaking services  which includes receiving a fee from customers that guarantees that those customers will receive gas under peak conditions 
the primary customer for these peaking services has historically been aglc 
under these peaking services  wholesale services recorded gross revenues of million in  million in and zero in fiscal all our peaking arrangements expire march  wholesale services also incurs costs to support our obligations under these agreements  which will be reduced in whole or in part as the matching obligations expire 
if these arrangements  including those with aglc are renewed  it is likely that future fees may not be reset at current levels 
we will continue to aggressively enter into new peaking transactions as well as work toward extending those that are set to expire 
competition sequent  although regionally focused in the eastern half of the united states  competes for natural gas suppliers and customers with national and regional full service energy providers  energy merchants  several large commercial and investment banks and natural gas producers 
due to the events in our industry in the last four years  the amount of competition has been significantly reduced 
our success is based on our ability to aggregate competitively priced commodities and services from our transportation and storage capacity and tailor our services to the customers needs 
we believe that we will continue to provide the basic services many customers are seeking  and we should benefit from the reduction in the number of competitors 
business expansion sequent has been focusing on expanding its business  both geographically and through added emphasis on the origination of new asset management transactions and growing the producer services businesses 
throughout we added personnel to focus specifically on these opportunities 
our business territory now extends from texas to chicago and all other areas of the united states east of the mississippi river 
in the fourth quarter of  we executed four new nonaffiliated asset management transactions and have increased our producer services volumes 
this expansion  as well as our other business growth  has increased sequent s fixed cost commitments in the form of firm capacity charges for transportation and storage contracts  and lengthened the average tenure of our portfolio to seven months 
at december   sequent s longest dated contract in its portfolio was nine years  with contract terms ranging from one day to nine years 
sequent s firm capacity commitments currently are o million in o million in o million in seasonality fixed cost commitments are generally incurred evenly over the year  while margins generated through the use of these assets are generally greatest in the winter heating season and in the summer due to peak usage by power generators for meeting air conditioning load 
this increases the seasonality of our business  generally resulting in expected higher margins in the first and fourth quarters 
business outlook continued growth of the nonaffiliated asset management and producer services business lines will be critical to sequent s success in given the continued exit of marketers due to business repositioning and credit limitations  sequent should benefit through increased market share 
additionally  although we manage our business with limited open positions and value at risk var  the rescission of eitf and our adoption of eitf could increase earnings volatility in our reported results  as more fully discussed below under energy marketing and risk management activities 
energy marketing and risk management activities during  and fiscal  we accounted for derivative transactions in connection with our energy marketing activities on a mark to market basis in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  and during and we accounted for nonderivative energy and energy related activities in accordance with eitf under these methods  we recorded energy commodity contracts including both physical transactions and financial instruments at fair value  with unrealized gains or losses from changes in fair value reflected in our earnings in the period of change 
we also recorded energy trading contracts  as defined under eitf  on a mark to market basis for transactions executed on or before october  energy trading contracts entered into after october  were recorded on an accrual basis as required under eitf s rescission of eitf  unless they were derivatives that must be recorded at fair value under sfas effective january   we adopted eitf  which rescinded eitf  and reached two general conclusions o contracts that do not meet the definition of a derivative under sfas should not be marked to fair market value 
o revenues should be shown in the income statement net of costs associated with trading activities  whether or not the trades are physically settled 
our adoption of eitf had the following impact o we recorded an adjustment to the carrying value of our nonderivative trading instruments principally our storage capacity contracts to zero  and now account for them using the accrual method of accounting 
o we recorded an adjustment to the value of our natural gas inventories used in wholesale services to the lower of average cost or market  they were previously recorded at fair value 
this resulted in the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in our statements of consolidated income for the three months ended march  of million million net of taxes  which resulted in a decrease of million to our energy marketing and risk management assets and a decrease in accumulated deferred income taxes of million in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
o we reclassified our trading activity on a net basis revenues net of costs effective july  as a result of the first consensus of eitf this reclassification had no impact on our previously reported net income or shareholders equity 
revenues for and fiscal are shown net of costs associated with trading activities 
sequent recorded unrealized gains of million  excluding the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  during  and unrealized gains of million in and million in fiscal  related to changes in the fair value of derivative instruments utilized in our energy marketing and risk management activities 
the tables below illustrate the change in the net fair value of the derivative instruments and energy trading contracts during and and provide details of the net fair value of contracts outstanding as of december  sequent s storage positions are affected by price sensitivity in the new york mercantile exchange  inc nymex average price 
in millions calendar calendar net fair value of contracts outstanding at beginning of period cumulative effect of change in accounting principle net fair value of contracts outstanding at beginning of period  as adjusted contracts realized or otherwise settled during period change in net fair value of contract losses gains net fair value of new contracts entered into during period net fair value of contracts outstanding at end of period the sources of our net fair value at december  are as follows in millions maturity less than year maturity years maturity years maturity in excess of years total net fair value prices actively quoted prices provided by other external sources the prices actively quoted category represents sequent s positions in natural gas  which are valued exclusively using nymex futures prices 
prices provided by other external sources are basis transactions that represent the cost to transport the commodity from a nymex delivery point to the contract delivery point 
our basis spreads are primarily based on quotes obtained either directly from brokers or through electronic trading platforms 
we had a net risk management liability at december  of million compared to a net risk management asset of million at december  we determined the amounts for relating to gas storage inventory on a mark to market basis  which was the appropriate accounting method at that time 
we recorded the gas storage inventory in on an accrual basis  at the lower of average cost or market 
therefore  these amounts are not directly comparable 
the fair value of our gas storage inventory position at december  was higher than average cost  but the fair value is not reflected in the financial statements due to the accounting rules now in effect 
at december  the fair value of this inventory was in excess of average cost by approximately million 
we used a calculation to compare the forward value using market prices at the expected withdrawal period with the cost of inventory included in the balance sheet 
additionally  million of this value must be shared under our asset management agreements but would be recorded in accounts payable 
this net million incremental value would have been reflected in our earnings for the year under mark to market accounting 
storage inventory outlook the nymex forward curve graph reflects the nymex natural gas prices as of december   also known as the nymex forward curve  through november these are the prices on december  at which we could buy natural gas at the henry hub for delivery in the time period of january through november open futures nymex contracts represents the volume in contract equivalents of the transactions we executed to economically hedge our storage inventory 
as of december   the expected withdrawal schedule of this inventory and its weighted average costs are reflected in the entry physical withdrawal schedule 
our futures contracts qualify as derivatives under sfas and are accounted for at fair value mark to market 
however  the storage inventory is accounted for under the accrual method  at the lower of average cost or market  resulting in a timing mismatch in earnings recognition 
we recognize the gains or losses on the futures contracts in the period the price changes  we recognize the gains or losses on the storage inventory as the gas is withdrawn from storage 
the schedule also reflects that our storage inventory is fully hedged with futures  which results in an overall locked in margin  timing notwithstanding 
expected gross margin after regulatory sharing reflects the gross margin we would generate in future periods based on the forward curve and inventory withdrawal schedule at december  this gross margin could change as we adjust our daily injection and withdrawal plans due to changes in market conditions 
park and loan outlook additionally  we have entered into park and loan transactions with various pipelines 
a park and loan transaction is a tariff transaction offered by pipelines  where the pipeline allows the customer to park gas on or borrow gas from the pipeline in one period and reclaim gas from or repay gas to the pipeline in a subsequent period 
the economics of these transactions are evaluated and managed similar to the way traditional reservoir and salt dome storage transactions are evaluated 
however  these transactions have elements that qualify as derivatives in accordance with sfas under sfas  the transactions are considered financing arrangements when the contracts contain volumes that are payable or repaid at determinable dates and at a specific point in time to third parties 
because these park and loan transactions have fixed volumes  they contain price risk for the change in market prices from the date the transaction is initiated to the time the gas is repaid 
as a result  these transactions qualify as derivatives under sfas that must be recorded at their fair value 
certain park and loan transactions that we execute meet this definition 
as such  we account for these transactions at fair value once the transaction has started either the gas is originally parked on or borrowed from the pipeline 
park and loan volumes represents the contract equivalent for the volumes of our park and loan transactions as of december  that are not already accounted for at fair value 
expected gross margin from park and loans represents the gross margin from those transactions expected to be recognized in future periods based on the forward curves at december

operating revenues cost of sales operating margin operation and maintenance expenses depreciation and amortization taxes other than income total operating expenses operating income other loss ebit metrics physical sales volumes bcf day compared to ebit increased million from primarily due to a million increase in operating margin  offset by an increase of million in operating expenses 
operating margin increased million due primarily to sequent s optimization of various transportation and storage assets  mainly in the first quarter when natural gas prices were highly volatile 
in the first quarter  sequent sold substantially all its inventory that was previously recorded on a mark to market basis under the now rescinded eitf this resulted in million in realized income  offset by amounts shared with our affiliated ldcs for transactions that were recorded on a mark to market basis in prior periods 
the increase in operating margin was partly offset by lower natural gas volatility created by unseasonably cool temperatures in the southeast  midwest and upper mid atlantic during the summer of as compared to the summer of  when volatility was higher as a result of two hurricanes in the gulf of mexico and warmer than normal temperatures in the northeast 
operating expenses increased by million  primarily due to a million increase in corporate costs and a million increase primarily due to personnel and outside consulting costs incurred while growing the business 
sequent s physical sales volumes for increased to bcf day as compared to this increase was partially attributable to sequent s successful efforts to gain additional new business in the midwest and northeast 
additionally  a number of market factors  including colder temperatures during the winter in market areas served by sequent and reduced amounts of gas in storage as the winter progressed  resulted in increased volatility in sequent s markets during the first quarter of compared to the same period of the volatility in the second and third quarters returned to seasonal averages and increased slightly above average in the fourth quarter 
compared to fiscal the increase in ebit of million for as compared to fiscal was due to increased operating margin of million and a million decrease in other loss  offset by a million increase in operating expenses 
operating margin increased million  primarily from increased weather volatility from warmer than normal weather in the northeast  two hurricanes during the late summer  colder weather in november and december  and an overall increase in volumes sold 
these weather related events caused interruption in the supply demand equilibrium between the affected production and market areas  resulting in wide geographical pricing disparities 
sequent used its access to contracted assets and its expertise in logistics to maximize the profit opportunity by flowing gas on the most economical path available 
additionally  operating margin was positively impacted by peaking services  which were not provided in fiscal physical gas sales volumes increased from bcf day in fiscal to bcf day in operating expenses increased million  primarily from the addition of personnel to support growth in the business and a full year of operating expenses following sequent s formation in early other loss decreased million primarily due to the write off in fiscal of our investment in etowah lng of million  resulting from the termination of the joint venture partnership originally formed in energy investments our energy investments segment includes our investments in southstar and us propane lp us propane  the results of operations and financial condition of agl networks  llc agl networks  and utilipro through the date of its sale in o southstar is a joint venture formed in by our subsidiary  georgia natural gas company  piedmont and dynegy to market natural gas and related services to retail customers  principally in georgia 
initially  we owned a interest in southstar  piedmont owned a interest and dynegy owned the remaining interest 
on march   we purchased dynegy s ownership interest in a transaction that for accounting purposes had an effective date of february  upon closing  we owned a noncontrolling financial interest in southstar and piedmont owned the remaining 
our interest is noncontrolling because all significant matters require approval by both owners 
we recognize our equity in earnings of southstar based upon our ownership interest plus the amount recognized for disproportionate sharing  as discussed below 
for all periods prior to february   southstar s earnings have been allocated to us based upon our ownership interests in those periods or 
competition southstar  which operates under the trade name georgia natural gas  competes with other energy marketers  including marketers in georgia  to provide natural gas and related services to customers in georgia and the southeast 
based upon its market share  southstar is the largest retail marketer of natural gas in georgia with a monthly year to date average of approximately  customers 
this represents a market share of approximately as of december   which is relatively consistent with its market share of in the prior year 
disproportionate sharing southstar s operating policy contains provisions for the disproportionate sharing of earnings with our partner in southstar  piedmont  when southstar s annual earnings before taxes exceed a certain threshold 
the threshold is calculated each year based on a cumulative and annual return on contributed capital 
southstar s operating policy requires that earnings above the threshold be allocated at various percentages based on actual margin generated in the four defined service areas of the operating policy  and distributed annually to each owner as a mandatory distribution 
disproportionate sharing is only applicable to our original financial interest in southstar 
no disproportionate sharing of earnings had occurred prior to december because the owners had not reached an agreement on how disproportionate sharing should be calculated 
on december   the owners resolved their differences over the interpretation of the provisions in the operating policy that provided for the disproportionate sharing of earnings through an agreement that provides for southstar s earnings to be allocated to us and to piedmont  less income allocable to dynegy prior to february  the agreement resulted in our recognition of million of equity earnings for disproportionate sharing for the months ended december  the agreement also provided for a one time cash distribution of million to the owners on december   which was allocated million to us and million to piedmont 
the agreement further resolved all issues related to the allocation of earnings for all years prior to by allocating earnings for such prior years based on the current owners respective interests for such prior fiscal years 
o agl networks  our wholly owned subsidiary  is a provider of telecommunications conduit and dark fiber 
agl networks leases and sells its fiber to a variety of customers in the atlanta  georgia and phoenix  arizona metropolitan areas  with a small presence in other cities in the united states

for the future  we believe these sources will be sufficient for our working capital needs  debt service obligations and scheduled capital expenditures 
however  our liquidity and capital resource requirements may change in the future due to a number of factors  some of which we cannot control 
these factors include o the seasonal nature of the natural gas business and our resulting short term borrowing requirements  which typically peak during colder months o increased gas supplies required to meet our customers needs during cold weather o regulatory changes and changes in rate making policies of regulatory commissions o contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments o interest rate changes o pension and postretirement benefit costs o changes in income tax laws o changes in wholesale prices and customer demand for our products and services o margin requirements resulting from significant increases or decreases in our commodity prices o operational risks the availability of borrowings under our credit facility is subject to conditions specified within the credit facility  which we currently meet 
these conditions include compliance with certain financial covenants and the continued accuracy of representations and warranties contained in the agreements

 accounting for leases sfas 
however  this accounting treatment does not affect the future annual operating lease cash obligations as shown herein 
we calculate the amount of funding using an actuarial method called the projected unit cost method 
however  it is not necessarily required and we may fund lesser amounts in the future 
we have not included expected contributions for years subsequent to cash flow from operating activities we have historically had a working capital deficit  primarily as a result of our borrowings of short term debt to finance the purchase of long term assets  principally property  plant and equipment 
year to year changes in our operating cash flows are primarily the result of the following o changes in our operating results o variability in the distribution of earnings we receive from our equity investments o the timing associated with working capital items such as cash collections from our customers o payments for operating expenses to our vendors and employees  income taxes and interest our statement of cash flows is prepared using the indirect method 
under this method  net income is reconciled to cash flows from operating activities by adjusting net income for those items that impact net income but do not result in actual cash receipts or payments during the period 
these reconciling items include depreciation  undistributed earnings from equity investments  changes in deferred income taxes  gains or losses on the sale of assets and changes in the balance sheet for working capital from the beginning to the end of the period 
compared to our cash flow from operations in was million  a decrease of million from this decrease was primarily the result of increased spending for injection of natural gas inventories of approximately bcf 
the weighted average cost of this inventory increased approximately as compared to last year

this was offset by increased net income of million and cash received from southstar of million 
compared to fiscal our cash flow from operations was million for  an increase of million from fiscal this increase was primarily as a result of growth in transaction volumes in wholesale services and cash received of million from the sale of natural gas inventories  primarily storage gas sold to marketers  in excess of cash purchases 
also  the increase was a result of increased net income of million

we estimate our total future capital expenditures related to the prp to be million 
capital expenditures under this program are expected to end june   unless the program is extended by the gpsc 
these costs are not included in our cash flows from investing activities as they are not considered property  plant and equipment expenditures 
they are considered a factor in our capital requirements as we estimate our cash requirements for future years 
compared to the decrease of million or in property  plant and equipment expenditures for as compared to was primarily due to lower telecommunications expenditures of million as a result of the completion of the metro atlanta fiber network in  and a decrease in construction of distribution facilities of million associated with distribution operations 
the million decrease in the erc expenditures was primarily due to work delays in augusta and savannah 
the estimated erc capital requirements for will increase as a result of these delays 
compared to fiscal the increase of million in property  plant and equipment expenditures for compared to fiscal was primarily from agl networks completion of the metro atlanta fiber network and the purchase of the phoenix fiber network 
compared to in  we estimate that our total capital requirements will increase as a result of capital expenditures for construction of distribution facilities and the prp 
our expected increase in the construction of distribution facilities is primarily from pivotal s projects in  including the propane facility at vng 
as shown in the following chart  our prp costs are expected to increase in the next five years primarily as a result of the replacement of larger diameter pipe than in prior years  the majority of which is located in more densely populated areas 
we expect the annual prp costs through to be in the range of million each year 
the prp recoveries shown in the chart are recorded as revenues and are based upon a formula that allows us to recover operation and maintenance costs in excess of those included in aglc s base rates  depreciation expense and an allowed rate of return on capital expenditures 
in the near term  the primary financial impact to us from the prp is reduced cash flow from operating and investing activities  as the timing related to costs recovery does not match the timing of when costs are incurred

cash flow from financing activities our financing activities are primarily composed of borrowings and payments of short term debt  payments of medium term notes  borrowings of senior notes  cash dividends on our common stock and the issuance of common stock 
our credit facility financial covenants and the puhca require us to maintain a ratio of total debt to total capitalization of no greater than

on february   we issued million in senior notes due february these senior notes have an interest rate of payable on january and july in may  we issued and sold million in principal amount of trust preferred securities 
these trust preferred securities are subject to mandatory redemption in may and may be redeemed early  beginning in we used the proceeds of the senior notes and trust preferred securities to reduce our commercial paper balance and for general corporate purposes 
interest rate swaps to maintain an effective capital structure  it is our policy to borrow funds using a mix of fixed rate debt and variable rate debt 
we have entered into interest rate swap agreements through our wholly owned subsidiary  agl capital  for the purpose of hedging the interest rate risk associated with our fixed rate and variable rate debt obligations

common stock on february   we completed our public offering of million shares of common stock 
we priced the offering at per share and generated net proceeds of approximately million  which we used to repay outstanding short term debt and for general corporate purposes 
dividends on common stock on april   we announced a increase in our common stock dividend  raising the quarterly dividend from per share to per share  which equates to an indicated annual dividend of per share 
in  this increase in our common stock dividend along with the shares issued in connection with our equity offering resulted in an approximately million increase in dividends paid on our common shares 
shelf registration we currently have an active shelf registration statement for up to million of various capital securities  with remaining capacity of approximately million 
on september   we filed a second shelf registration with the sec for authority to increase our capacity to billion of various capital securities 
we may seek additional financing through debt or equity offerings in the private or public markets at any time 
credit rating our credit ratings impact our ability to obtain short term and long term financing and the cost of such financing 
in determining our credit ratings  the rating agencies consider a number of factors 
quantitative factors that appear to be given significant weight include  among other factors o earnings o operating cash flow o total debt outstanding o total equity outstanding o pension liabilities and funding status o the level of capital expenditures and other commitments o fixed charges such as interest expense  rent or lease payments o payments to preferred stockholders o liquidity needs and availability o total debt to total capitalization ratios o various ratios calculated from these factors qualitative factors appear to include  among other things  the stability of regulation in each jurisdiction  risks and controls inherent with wholesale services  predictability of cash flows  business strategy  management  corporate governance principles  board experience and independence  industry position and contingencies 
our credit ratings may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and you should evaluate each rating independently of any other rating 
we cannot assure you that a rating will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if  in its judgment  circumstances so warrant 
during  no fundamental adverse shift occurred in our ratings profile 
the following table presents as of january  the credit ratings on our unsecured debt issues from the three major rating agencies 
the ratings are all investment grade status and the outlooks for all credit ratings are stable 
type of facility moody s s p fitch commercial paper p a f medium term notes a a a senior notes baa bbb a trust preferred securities baa bbb bbb our debt instruments and other financial obligations include provisions that  if not complied with  could require early payment  additional collateral support or similar actions 
our most important default events include o a maximum leverage ratio o minimum net worth o insolvency events and nonpayment of scheduled principal or interest payments o acceleration of other financial obligations o change of control provisions we do not have any trigger events in our debt instruments that are tied to changes in our specified credit ratings or our stock price and have not entered into any transaction that requires us to issue equity based on credit ratings or other trigger events 
we are currently in compliance with all existing debt provisions and covenants 
sequent has certain trade and or credit contracts that have explicit credit rating trigger events in case of a credit rating downgrade 
these rating triggers typically would give counterparties the right to suspend or terminate credit if our credit ratings were downgraded to non investment grade status 
under such circumstances  we would need to post collateral to continue transacting business with some of our counterparties 
posting collateral would have a negative effect on our liquidity 
if such collateral were not posted  our ability to continue transacting business with these counterparties would be impaired 
at december   if our credit ratings were downgraded to non investment grade  the required amounts to satisfy potential collateral demands under such agreements between sequent and its counterparties would have totaled million 
we believe the existing cash and available liquidity under our credit facility is adequate to fund these potential liquidity requirements 
critical accounting policies the selection and application of critical accounting policies are important processes that have progressed as our business activities have evolved and as a result of new accounting pronouncements 
accounting rules generally do not involve a selection among alternatives  but rather involve an implementation and interpretation of existing rules and the use of judgment as to the specific set of circumstances existing in our business 
each of the critical accounting policies involves complex situations requiring a high degree of judgment either in the application and interpretation of existing literature or in the development of estimates that impact our financial statements 
regulatory accounting we account for transactions within our distribution operations segment according to the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation sfas 
applying this accounting policy allows us to defer expenses and income in the consolidated balance sheets as regulatory assets and liabilities when it is probable that those expenses and income will be allowed in the rate setting process in a period different from the period in which they would have been reflected in the statements of consolidated income of an unregulated company 
we then recognize these deferred regulatory assets and liabilities in our statements of consolidated income in the period in which we reflect the same amounts in rates 
if any portion of distribution operations ceased to continue to meet the criteria for application of regulatory accounting treatment for all or part of its operations  we would eliminate the regulatory assets and liabilities related to those portions ceasing to meet such criteria from our consolidated balance sheets and include them in our statements of consolidated income for the period in which the discontinuance of regulatory accounting treatment occurred 
pipeline replacement program prp aglc recorded a long term liability of million as of december  and million as of december   which represented engineering estimates for remaining capital expenditure costs in the prp 
as of december   aglc had recorded a current liability of million  representing expected prp expenditures for the next months 
these estimates are reported on an undiscounted basis 
the prp ordered by the gpsc to be administered by aglc requires  among other things  that aglc replace all bare steel and cast iron pipe in aglc s system in the state of georgia within a year period  beginning october  aglc identified and provided to the gpsc in accordance with this order  miles of bare steel and cast iron pipe to be replaced 
aglc has subsequently identified an additional miles of pipe subject to replacement under this program 
if aglc does not perform in accordance with this order  aglc will be assessed certain nonperformance penalties 
the order also provides for recovery of all prudent costs incurred in the performance of the program  which aglc has recorded as a regulatory asset 
the regulatory asset has two components o the costs incurred to date that have not yet been recovered through rate riders o the future expected costs to be recovered through rate riders environmental response costs erc aglc historically reported estimates of future remediation costs based on probabilistic models of potential costs 
these estimates were reported on an undiscounted basis 
as we continue to conduct the actual remediation and enter cleanup contracts  aglc is increasingly able to provide conventional engineering estimates of the likely costs of many elements of its manufactured gas plant mgp program 
these estimates contain various engineering uncertainties  and aglc continuously attempts to refine and update these engineering estimates 
in addition  aglc continues to review technologies available for cleanup of aglc s two largest sites  savannah and augusta  which  if proven  could have the effect of further reducing aglc s total future expenditures 
the following table shows components of aglc s erc liability as of december  and in millions dec 
 dec  vs 
projected engineering estimates and in place contracts estimated future remediation costs administrative expenses other expenses cash payments for cleanup expenditures accrued erc as of september  and september  for the respective calendar years 
expenditures during the three months ended december  and december  our latest available estimate as of september  for those elements of the mgp program with in place contracts or engineering cost estimates is million 
this is a reduction of million from the estimate as of september  of projected engineering and in place contracts  resulting from million of program expenditures during the months ended september  and a million reduction in future cost estimates 
for elements of the mgp program where aglc still cannot perform engineering cost estimates  considerable variability remains in available estimates 
for these elements  the estimated remaining cost of future actions at mgp sites is million 
aglc estimates certain other costs paid directly by aglc related to administering the mgp program and remediation of sites currently in the investigation phase 
through january  aglc estimates the administration costs to be million 
beyond january  these costs are not estimable 
for those sites currently in the investigation phase our estimate is million  which is based upon preliminary data received during with respect to the existence of contamination of those sites 
our range of estimates for these sites is from million to million 
we have accrued the low end of our range  or million  as this is our best estimate at this phase of the remediation process 
the erc liability is included in a corresponding regulatory asset 
as of december   the regulatory asset was million  which is a combination of the accrued erc and unrecovered cash expenditures 
aglc s estimate does not include other potential expenses  such as unasserted property damage  personal injury or natural resource damage claims  unbudgeted legal expenses  or other costs for which aglc may be held liable but with respect to which the amount cannot be reasonably forecast 
aglc s estimate also does not include any potential cost savings from the new cleanup technologies referenced above 
revenue recognition distribution operations the vng and cgc rate structures include volumetric rate designs that allow recovery of costs through gas usage 
vng and cgc recognize revenues from sales of natural gas and transportation services in the same period in which they deliver the related volumes to customers 
vng and cgc bill and recognize sales revenues from residential and certain commercial and industrial customers on the basis of scheduled meter readings 
in addition  vng and cgc record revenues for estimated deliveries of gas  not yet billed to these customers  from the meter reading date to the end of the accounting period 
we include these revenues in our consolidated balance sheets as unbilled revenue 
included in the rates charged by vng and cgc is a wna factor  which offsets the impact of unusually cold or warm weather on operating margins 
vng s weather normalization factor was introduced in november as a two year experimental wna program 
for certain commercial and industria l customers and all wholesale customers  vng and cgc recognize revenues based upon actual deliveries during the accounting period 
wholesale services we record wholesale services revenues when physical sales of natural gas and natural gas storage volumes are delivered to the specified delivery point based on contracted or market prices 
we reflect revenues from commodities sold as part of wholesale services trading and derivative activities that are not designated as hedges  net of the cost of these sales 
we record derivative transactions at their fair value 
wholesale services accounts for derivative instruments under sfas  which requires us to record all derivatives  as defined therein  in our balance sheets at their fair value 
we reflect these derivatives in our consolidated balance sheets as risk management assets or liabilities 
the market prices used in estimating the fair value of these contracts are based on our best estimates  utilizing information such as commodity exchange prices  over the counter quotes  volatility  time value  counterparty credit and the potential impact on market prices of liquidating positions in an orderly manner over a reasonable period of time under current market conditions 
when the portfolio market value changes  primarily due to newly originated transactions and the effect of price changes  wholesale services recognizes the change in value of derivative instruments as a gain or loss in revenues in the period of change 
we recognize cash inflows and outflows associated with settlement of these risk management activities in operating cash flows  and we report these settlements as receivables and payables separately from risk management activities in the balance sheets as energy marketing receivables and trade payables 
we adopted the net presentation provisions of the june consensus for eitf on july  as required under that consensus  we present gains and losses from energy trading activities on a net basis 
this reclassification had no impact on our previously reported net income or shareholders equity 
during  and fiscal  we accounted for derivative transactions in connection with our energy marketing activities in accordance with sfas  and during and we accounted for nonderivative energy and energy related activities in accordance with eitf under these methods  we recorded energy commodity contracts  including both physical transactions and financial instruments  at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses reflected in earnings in the period of change 
effective january   we adopted the final provisions of eitf  which rescinded eitf prior to eitf  wholesales services accounted for nonderivative energy instruments  such as contracts for storage capacity and physical natural gas inventory  at their fair value under eitf as a result of this adoption  effective january   wholesale services adjusted the fair value of its nonderivative trading instruments to zero and now accounts for them under the accrual method of accounting 
in addition  its natural gas inventories are now recorded at the lower of average cost or market 
the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle resulted in a million pretax reduction to income before the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle million net of taxes  a decrease of million to energy marketing and risk management assets  and a million decrease to accumulated deferred income taxes in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
energy investments southstar recognizes revenues from sales of natural gas and transportation services in the same period in which it delivers the related volumes to customers 
southstar bills and recognizes sales revenues from residential and certain commercial and industrial customers on the basis of scheduled meter readings 
in addition  southstar records revenues for estimated deliveries of gas  not yet billed to these customers  from the last meter reading date to the end of the accounting period 
for certain commercial and industrial customers and all wholesale customers  southstar recognizes revenues based upon actual deliveries during the accounting period 
agl networks recognizes revenues attributable to leases of dark fiber pursuant to indefeasible rights of use iru agreements as services are provided 
dark fiber iru agreements generally require the customer to make a down payment upon execution of the agreement  however  in some cases agl networks receives up to the entire lease payment at the inception of the lease and recognizes revenue ratably over the lease term 
as a result  we record deferred revenue in our consolidated balance sheets 
in addition  agl networks recognizes sales revenues upon the execution of certain sales type agreements for dark fiber when the agreements provide for the transfer of legal title of the dark fiber to the customer at the end of the agreement s term 
this sales type accounting treatment is in accordance with eitf issue no 
 lessors evaluation of whether leases of certain integral equipment meet the ownership transfer requirements of fasb statement no 
 accounting for leases  for leases of real estate eitf  and sfas no 
 accounting for sales of real estate sfas  which provides that such transactions meet the criteria for sales type lease accounting if the agreement obligates the lessor to convey ownership of the underlying asset to the lessee by the end of the lease term 
agl networks is obligated  under the dark fiber irus  to maintain the network in efficient working order and in accordance with industry standards 
customers contract with agl networks to provide maintenance services for the network 
agl networks recognizes this maintenance revenue as services are provided 
agl networks also engages in construction projects on behalf of customers 
projects are considered substantially complete upon customer acceptance  and the revenue and associated expenses are recorded at that time 
accounting for contingencies our accounting policies for contingencies cover a variety of business activities  including contingencies for potentially uncollectible receivables  rate matters  and legal and environmental exposures 
we accrue for these contingencies when our assessments indicate that it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset will not be recovered  and an amount can be reasonably estimated in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies sfas 
we base our estimates for these liabilities on currently available facts and our estimates of the ultimate outcome or resolution of the liability in the future 
actual results may differ from estimates  and estimates can be  and often are  revised either negatively or positively  depending upon actual outcomes or changes in the facts or expectations surrounding each potential exposure 
accounting for pension benefits we have a defined benefit pension plan for the benefit of substantially all full time employees and qualified retirees 
we use several statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events and to calculate the expense and liability related to the plan 
these factors include our assumptions about the discount rate  expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases 
in addition  our actuarial consultants use subjective factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates to estimate the projected benefit obligation 
the actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates  or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
these differences may result in a significant impact on the amount of pension expense recorded in future periods 
as of december   we recorded an additional minimum pension liability of million  which resulted in an aftertax loss to other comprehensive income oci of million for at december   we reduced our minimum pension liability by approximately million  which resulted in an aftertax gain to oci of million 
this reflects the impact of our funding contributions to the plan and updated valuations for the projected benefit obligation and plan assets 
to the extent that our future expenses and contributions increase as a result of the additional minimum pension liability  we believe that such increases are recoverable in whole or in part under future rate proceedings or mechanisms 
equity market performance and corporate bond rates have a significant effect on our reported unfunded accumulated benefit obligation abo  as the primary factors that drive the value of our unfunded abo are the assumed discount rate and the actual return on plan assets 
additionally  equity market performance has a significant effect on our market related value of plan assets mrvpa  which is a calculated value and differs from the actual market value of plan assets 
the mrvpa recognizes the differences between the actual market value and expected market value of our plan assets and is determined by our actuaries using a five year moving weighted average methodology 
gains and losses on plan assets are spread through the mrvpa based on the five year moving weighted average methodology  which affects the expected return on plan assets component of pension expense 
a one percentage point increase in the assumed discount rate would have a negative impact on the abo of approximately million and would decrease pension expense by approximately million 
a one percentage point decrease in the assumed discount rate would have a positive impact on the abo of approximately million and would increase pension expense by approximately million 
additionally  a one percentage point increase or decrease in the expected return on assets would decrease or increase our pension expense by approximately million 
as of december   the market value of the pension assets was million compared to a market value of million as of december  the net increase of million resulted from o contributions of million in february o contributions of million in september o contributions of million in october o contributions of million in to our supplemental retirement plan o an actual return on plan assets of million less benefits paid of million our million in contributions to the pension plan this year reduced pension expense by approximately million in the actual return on plan assets compared to the expected return on plan assets will have an impact on our benefit obligation as of december  and our pension expense for we are unable to determine how this actual return on plan assets will affect future benefit obligation and pension expense  as actuarial assumptions and differences between actual and expected returns on plan assets are determined at the time we complete our actuarial evaluation as of december  our actual returns may also be positively or negatively impacted as a result of future performance in the equity and bond markets 
accounting developments fin in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin  which requires the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity s activities to consolidate the variable interest entity 
the primary beneficiary is the party that absorbs a majority of the expected losses and or receives a majority of the expected residual returns of the variable interest entity s activities 
in december  the fasb revised fin  delaying the effective dates for certain entities created before february   and making other amendments to clarify application of the guidance 
for potential variable interest entities other than any special purpose entities spes  the revised fin fin r is now required to be applied no later than the end of the first fiscal year or interim reporting period ending after march  the original guidance under fin is still applicable  however  for all spes created prior to february  at the end of the first interim or annual reporting period ending after december  fin r may be applied prospectively with a cumulative effect adjustment as of the date it is first applied  or by restating previously issued financial statements with a cumulative effect adjustment as of the beginning of the first year restated 
fin r also requires certain disclosures of an entity s relatio nship with variable interest entities 
we will adopt fin r for non spe entities as of march  in june and march  we established agl capital trust i and agl capital trust ii trusts to issue our trust preferred securities 
we consider the trusts to be variable interest entities since the trusts total equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the trusts to finance their own activities without additional subordinated financial support provided by any parties 
we consider ourselves the primary beneficiary of the trusts as we call options on our loans to the trusts  thus entitling us to a majority of the trusts expected residual returns 
in addition  there is not one party that absorbs a majority of the trusts expected losses  as the trust preferred securities are publicly traded and widely held 
as such  we are the primary beneficiary of the trusts and have consolidated the trusts under fin we have  therefore  continued to classify amounts related to the trust preferred securities as subsidiaries obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred securities within capitalization in our consolidated balance sheets as of december  we believe fin r will have an impact on the accounting for the trust preferred securities 
we believe this will result in deconsolidating the trusts  and recording an investment representing our equity investment in the trusts and our liability to the trusts as a long term liability 
at december   we would have included in our balance sheet an asset of approximately million representing our investment in the trusts  and a liability to the trusts totaling approximately million  had we adopted early fin r 
this represents the loan payable to fund our investment in the trusts and the amount due to the trusts from the proceeds received from their issuances of preferred securities of million 
we are currently finalizing our evaluation of fin r with respect to the trust preferred securities  and will reflect the necessary adjustments in our march  financial statements 
we are also evaluating the potential impact of fin r on our accounting for our investment in southstar see energy investments section of our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note  equity investments for a discussion about the nature  purpose  size and activities of southstar  which will be effective in our march  financial statements 
it is at least reasonably possible we will deem that southstar is a variable interest entity under its current structure and that we are the primary beneficiary 
additionally  we are in negotiations with piedmont to revise the southstar partnership agreement  and we are also negotiating a management services agreement under which we would provide certain management functions to southstar 
we believe that such changes to the southstar relationship would require us to re evaluate whether we are the primary beneficiary of southstar under the provisions of fin r 
if we determine that we are the primary beneficiary pursuant to fin r  we would be required to consolidate southstar and would reflect the necessary adjustments in our march  financial statements 
as of december   our maximum exposure to loss is our equity investment in southstar of million 
additionally  we have not provided any loans  guarantees or pledged collateral to southstar  and southstar s creditors have no recourse to our general credit 
sfas effective december   the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of medicare prescription drug act  was signed into law  which provides for a prescription drug benefit under medicare part d as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to medicare part d 
our defined benefit postretirement health care and life insurance plans do provide a prescription drug benefit 
the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp  accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of fsp on january  fsp allowed companies to elect a one time deferral of the recognition of the effects of the medicare prescription drug act in accounting for its plan under sfas  and in providing disclosures related to the plan required by sfas revised see below 
the fasb allowed the one time deferral because of the accounting issues raised by the medicare prescription drug act  in particular  the accounting for the federal subsidy that is not explicitly addressed in sfas  and because uncertainties exist regarding the direct effects of the medicare prescription drug act and its ancillary effects on plan participants 
for companies electing the one time deferral  such deferral remains in effect until authoritative guidance on the accounting for the federal subsidy is issued  or until certain other events  such as a plan amendment  settlement or curtailment  occur 
we are currently evaluating the effects of the medicare prescription drug act on our other postretirement benefit plan and its participants and have elected the one time deferral 
our accumulated postretirement obligation or net periodic postretirement benefit cost for does not reflect the effects of the medicare prescription drug act on our other postretirement plan 
additionally  once the specific authoritative guidance on the accounting for the federal subsidy is issued  such guidance could cause us to change previously reported information 
sfas on december   the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits an amendment of fasb statements no 
 and sfas revised 
sfas revised is effective for fiscal years ending after december  interim disclosure requirements under sfas revised will be effective for interim periods beginning after december   and required disclosures related to estimated benefit payments will be effective for fiscal years ending after june  sfas revised replaces the disclosure requirements in sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions sfas  sfas no 
 employers accounting for settlements and curtailments of defined benefit pension plans and for termination benefits sfas  and sfas sfas revised addresses disclosures only and does not address measurement and recognition accounting for pension and postretirement benefits 
sfas revised requires additional disclosures related to the description of plan assets including investment strategies  plan obligations  cash flows and net periodic benefit cost of defined benefit pension and other defined benefit postretirement plans 
effective december   we adopted the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
revised with the exception of future expected benefit payments  which becomes effective for fiscal years ending after june  or december  for us 
sfas in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  sfas requires legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets to be recognized at their fair value at the time the obligations are incurred 
upon initial recognition of a liability  that cost is recognized as an obligation and capitalized as part of the related long lived asset 
we adopted sfas on january   and it did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations because no legally enforceable retirement obligations were identified 
our regulated entities currently accrue removal costs on many of our regulated long lived assets through depreciation expense in accordance with rates approved by their state jurisdictions 
in our current presentation  we have reclassified our accrual for removal costs from accumulated depreciation to a regulated liability as accumulated removal costs for the years ended december  sfas in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  which amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments and for hedging activities  including the qualifications for the normal purchases and normal sales exception 
the amendment reflects decisions made by the fasb in connection with issues raised about the application of sfas generally  the provisions of sfas will be applied prospectively for contracts entered into or modified after june   and for hedging relationships designated after june  adoption of sfas did not have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
sfas in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity sfas  which establishes standards for classification and measurement of certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equities 
under sfas  such financial instruments are required to be classified as liabilities in the statement of financial position 
the financial instruments affected include mandatorily redeemable stock  certain financial instruments that require or may require the issuer to buy back some of its shares in exchange for cash or other assets  and certain obligations that can be settled with shares of stock 
sfas is effective for all financial instruments entered into or modified after may  and was applied to our existing financial instruments beginning on july  adoption of sfas did not have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
eitf during  and  wholesale services accounted for transactions in connection with energy marketing and risk management activities under the fair value  or mark to market method of accounting  in accordance with sfas during and we accounted for nonderivative energy and energy related activities in accordance with eitf under these methods  we recorded energy commodity contracts including physical transactions and financial instruments at fair value and reflected unrealized gains and or losses in earnings in the period of change 
effective january   we adopted eitf  which rescinded the provisions of eitf for more information on our adoption of eitf and its effects on our consolidated results of operations  cash flows and financial position  see 
results of operations under wholesale services and 
critical accounting policies under revenue recognition 
risk factors the following are some of the factors that could affect our forward performance or could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in our forward looking statements 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of  or that we currently deem immaterial  also may become important factors that affect us 
risks related to our business risks related to the regulation of our businesses could impact the rates we are able to charge  our costs and our profitability 
our businesses are subject to regulation by federal  state and local regulatory authorities 
in particular  our distribution businesses are regulated by the sec under the puhca  the ferc  the gpsc  the tra and the vscc 
these authorities regulate many aspects of our distribution operations  including construction and maintenance of facilities  operations  safety  the rates that we can charge customers and the authorized cost of capital 
our ability to obtain rate increases and rate supplements to maintain our current rates of return depends upon regulatory discretion  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain rate increases or rate supplements or continue receiving our currently authorized rates of return 
deregulation in the natural gas industry is the separation of the provision and pricing of local distribution gas services into discrete components 
deregulation typically focuses on the separation of the gas distribution business from the gas sales business and is intended to cause the opening of the formerly regulated sales services to alternative unregulated suppliers of those services 
in  the georgia legislature enacted the natural gas competition and deregulation act 
to date  georgia is the only state in the southeast that has fully deregulated gas distribution operations  which ultimately resulted in aglc exiting the retail natural gas sales business while retaining its gas distribution operations 
gas marketers then assumed the retail gas sales responsibility at deregulated prices 
the deregulation process required aglc to completely reorganize its operations and personnel at significant expense 
it is possible that the legislature could reverse the deregulation process and require or permit aglc to provide retail gas sales service once again 
in addition  the gpsc has statutory authority on an emergency basis to order aglc to temporarily provide the same retail gas service that it provided prior to deregulation 
if either of these events were to occur  we would incur costs to reverse the restructuring process 
our revenues  operating results and financial condition may fluctuate with the economy and its corresponding impact on our customers 
our business is influenced by fluctuations in the economy 
as a result  adverse changes in the economy can have negative effects on our revenues  operating results and financial condition 
the level of economic and population growth in our regulated operations service territories  particularly new housing starts  directly affects our potential for growing our revenues 
the cost of providing pension and postretirement health care benefits to eligible former employees is subject to changes in pension fund values and changing demographics  and may have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
we have a defined benefit pension plan for the benefit of substantially all full time employees and qualified retirees 
see the section critical accounting policies 
the cost of providing these benefits to eligible current and former employees is subject to changes in the market value of our pension fund assets and changing demographics  including longer life expectancy of beneficiaries and an expected increase in the number of eligible former employees over the next five years 
we believe that sustained declines in equity markets and reductions in bond yields have and may continue to have a material adverse effect on the value of our pension funds 
in these circumstances  we may be required to recognize an increased pension expense or a charge to our profit and loss account to the extent that the pension fund values are less than the total anticipated liability under the plans 
we face increasing competition  and if we are unable to compete effectively  our revenues  operating results and financial condition will be adversely affected 
the natural gas business is highly competitive  and we are facing increasing competition from other companies that supply energy  including electric companies and  in some cases  energy marketing and trading companies 
in particular  the success of our investment in southstar is affected by the competition southstar faces from other energy marketers providing retail gas services in the southeast 
natural gas competes with other forms of energy  such as electricity 
the primary competitive factor is price 
changes in the price or availability of natural gas relative to other forms of energy and the ability of end users to convert to alternative fuels affect the demand for natural gas 
our wholesale services segment competes with larger  full service energy providers  which may limit our ability to grow our business 
wholesale services competes with national and regional full service energy providers  energy merchants  and producers and pipelines for sales based on our ability to aggregate competitively priced commodities with transportation and storage capacity 
some of our competitors are larger and better capitalized than we are and have more national and global exposure than we do 
this competition  and the addition of any new competitors  could negatively impact our wholesale services segment and our ability to grow our business 
our asset management arrangements between sequent and the affiliated ldcs and between sequent and its nonaffiliated customers may not be renewed or may be renewed at lower levels  which could have a significant impact on sequent s business 
sequent currently manages the storage and transportation assets of aglc  vng  cgc and four nonaffiliated customers  under which sequent shares profits it earns from the management of those assets with those customers and their customers 
sequent s results could be significantly impacted in the event that these agreements are not renewed or are amended or renewed with terms less favorable to us 
we have a concentration of credit risk in georgia  which could expose a significant portion of our accounts receivable to collection risks 
we have a concentration of credit risk related to the provision of natural gas services to georgia s marketers 
at september  prior to deregulation  aglc had approximately million end use customers in georgia 
in contrast  at december   aglc had only certificated and active marketers in georgia  four of which based on customer count and including southstar accounted for approximately of our total operating margin for as a result  aglc now depends on a very limited number of customers for revenues 
the failure of these marketers to pay aglc could adversely affect aglc s business and results of operations and expose it to difficulties in collecting aglc s accounts receivable 
aglc obtains security support in an amount equal to a minimum of two times a marketer s highest month s estimated bill from aglc and also bills intrastate delivery service in advance rather than in arrears 
additionall y  southstar markets directly to end use customers and has periodically experienced credit losses as a result of cold weather  variable prices and customers inability to pay 
our profitability may decline if the counterparties to our transactions fail to perform in accordance with our agreements 
wholesale services focuses on capturing the value from idle or underutilized energy assets  typically by executing transactions that balance the needs of various markets and time horizons 
wholesale services is exposed to the risk that counterparties to our transactions will not perform their obligations 
should the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform  we might be forced to enter into alternative hedging arrangements  honor the underlying commitment at then current market prices or return a significant portion of the consideration received for gas under a long term contract 
in such events  we might incur additional losses to the extent of amounts  if any  already paid to  or received from  counterparties 
we have a concentration of credit risk at sequent that could expose us to collection risks 
we often extend credit to our counterparties 
despite performing credit analysis prior to extending credit and seeking to effectuate netting agreements  we are exposed to the risk that we may not be able to collect amounts owed to us 
if the counterparty to such a transaction fails to perform and any collateral we have secured is inadequate  we could experience material financial losses 
we have a concentration of credit risk at sequent  which could expose a significant portion of our credit exposure to collection risks 
approximately of sequent s credit exposure is concentrated in counterparties 
although most of this concentration is with counterparties that are either load serving utilities or end use customers and that have supplied some level of credit support  default by any of these counterparties in their obligations to pay amounts due sequent could result in credit losses that would negatively impact our wholesale services segment 
we are exposed to market risk and may incur losses in wholesale services 
the commodity  storage and transportation portfolios of wholesale services consist of contracts to buy and sell natural gas commodities  including contracts that are settled by the delivery of the commodity or cash 
if the values of these contracts change in a direction or manner that we do not anticipate  we could experience financial losses from our trading activities 
value at risk var is defined as the maximum potential loss in portfolio value over a specified time period that is not expected to be exceeded within a given degree of probability 
based on a confidence interval and employing a day and a day holding period for all positions  sequent s portfolio of positions as of december  had a day holding period var and day holding period var of million and million  respectively 
our hedging procedures may not fully protect our sales and net income from volatility 
to lower our financial exposure related to commodity price fluctuations  wholesale services may enter into contracts to hedge the value of our energy assets and operations 
as part of this strategy  we may utilize fixed price  forward  physical purchase and sales contracts  futures  and financial swaps and option contracts traded in the over the counter markets or on exchanges 
however  we do not always hedge against the entire marketplace volatility exposure of our energy assets or our positions 
to the extent we have unhedged positions or our hedging procedures do not work as planned  fluctuating commodity prices could cause our net income to be volatile 
our accounting results may not be indicative of the risks we are taking or the economic results we expect due to changes in accounting for wholesale services 
although wholesale services enters into various contracts to hedge the value of our energy assets and operations  the timing of the recognition of profits or losses on the hedges does not always match up with the profits or losses on the item being hedged 
this can result in volatility in reported earnings from one period to the next that does not exist from an economic standpoint over the full life of the hedge and the hedged item 
our business is subject to environmental regulation in all jurisdictions in which we operate and our costs to comply are significant  and any changes in existing environmental regulation could negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition 
our operations and properties are subject to extensive environmental regulation pursuant to a variety of federal  state and municipal laws and regulations 
such environmental legislation imposes  among other things  restrictions  liabilities and obligations in connection with storage  transportation  treatment and disposal of hazardous substances and waste and in connection with spills  releases and emissions of various substances into the environment 
environmental legislation also requires that our facilities  sites and other properties associated with our operations be operated  maintained  abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities 
our current costs to comply with these laws and regulations are significant to our results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  claims against us under environmental laws and regulations could result in material costs and liabilities 
existing environmental regulations could also be revised or reinterpreted  new laws and regulations could be adopted or become applicable to us or our facilities  and future changes in environmental laws and regulations could occur 
with the trend toward stricter standards  greater regulation  more extensive permit requirements and an increase in the number and types of assets operated by us subject to environmental regulation  our environmental expenditures could increase in the future 
additionally  the discovery of presently unknown environmental conditions could give rise to expenditures and liabilities  including fines or penalties  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
we could incur additional material costs for the environmental condition of some of our assets  including former manufactured gas plants 
we are generally responsible for all on site and certain off site liabilities associated with the environmental condition of the natural gas assets that we have operated  acquired or developed  regardless of when the liabilities arose and whether they are or were known or unknown 
in addition  in connection with certain acquisitions and sales of assets  we may obtain  or be required to provide  indemnification against certain environmental liabilities 
before natural gas was widely available in the southeast  we manufactured gas from coal and other fuels 
those manufacturing operations were known as manufactured gas plants  or mgps  which we ceased operating in the s 
we have identified sites in georgia and in florida where we  or our predecessors  own or owned all or part of an mgp site 
we are required to investigate possible environmental contamination at those mgp sites and  if necessary  clean up any contamination 
to date  we believe that some cleanup is likely at most of the sites and  as of december  the remediation program was approximately complete 
as of december   projected costs associated with the mgp sites were million 
for elements of the mgp program where we still cannot perform engineering cost estimates  considerable variability remains in available future cost estimates 
the success of our telecommunications business strategy may be adversely affected by uncertain market conditions 
the current strategy of our telecommunications business is based upon our ability to lease telecommunications conduit and dark fiber in the atlanta  georgia and phoenix  arizona metropolitan areas 
the market for these services  like the telecommunications industry in general  is very competitive  rapidly changing and currently suffering from lack of market commitments 
we cannot be certain that growth in demand for these services will occur as expected 
if the market for these services fails to grow as anticipated or becomes saturated with competitors  including competitors using alternative technologies  our investment in the telecommunications business may be adversely affected 
future acquisitions and expansions  if any  may affect our business by increasing the level of our indebtedness and contingent liabilities and creating integration difficulties 
from time to time  we will evaluate and acquire assets or businesses  or enter into joint venture arrangements that we believe complement our existing businesses and related assets 
these acquisitions and joint ventures may require substantial capital or the incurrence of additional indebtedness 
further  acquired operations or joint ventures may not achieve levels of revenues  operating income or productivity comparable to those of our existing operations  or may not otherwise perform as expected 
acquisitions or joint ventures may also involve a number of risks  including o our inability to integrate operations  systems and procedures o the assumption of unknown risks and liabilities o diversion of management s attention and resources o difficulty retaining and training acquired key personnel risks related to our corporate and financial structure if we breach any of the material financial covenants under our various indentures  credit facilities or guarantees  our debt service obligations could be accelerated 
our existing debt and the debt of certain of our subsidiaries contain a number of significant financial covenants 
if we or any of these subsidiaries breach any of the financial covenants under these agreements  our debt repayment obligations under these agreements could be accelerated 
in such event  we may not be able to refinance or repay all our indebtedness  which would result in a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we depend on our ability to successfully access the capital markets 
any inability to access the capital or financial markets may limit our ability to execute our business plan or pursue improvements that we may rely on for future growth 
we rely on access to both short term money markets in the form of commercial paper and long term capital markets as a source of liquidity for capital and operating requirements not satisfied by the cash flow from our operations 
if we are not able to access financial markets at competitive rates  our ability to implement our business plan and strategy will be affected 
certain market disruptions may increase our cost of borrowing or affect our ability to access one or more financial markets 
such market disruptions could result from o adverse economic conditions o adverse general capital market conditions o poor performance and health of the utility industry in general o bankruptcy or financial distress of unrelated energy companies or marketers in georgia o decreases in the market price of and demand for natural gas o adverse regulatory actions that affect our local gas distribution companies o terrorist attacks on our facilities or our suppliers increases in our leverage could adversely affect our competitive position and financial condition 
an increase in our debt relative to our total capitalization could adversely affect us by o increasing the cost of future debt financing o limiting our ability to obtain additional financing  if we need it  for working capital  acquisitions  debt service requirements or other purposes o making it more difficult for us to satisfy our existing financial obligations o requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt  which would reduce funds available to us for operations  future business opportunities or other purposes o prohibiting the payment of dividends on our common stock or adversely impacting our ability to pay such dividends at the current rate o increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions o limiting our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we compete changing rating agency requirements could negatively affect our growth and business strategy  and a downgrade in our credit rating could negatively affect our ability to access capital 
standard poor s ratings group s p  moody s investors service  inc moody s and fitch  inc fitch have recently implemented new requirements for various ratings levels 
in order to maintain our current credit ratings in light of these or future new requirements  we may find it necessary to take steps or change our business plans in ways that may affect our growth and earnings per share 
s p and fitch currently assign our senior unsecured debt a rating of bbb  and moody s currently assigns our senior unsecured debt a rating of baa our commercial paper currently is rated a by s p and moody s 
if the rating agencies downgraded our ratings  particularly below investment grade  it may significantly limit our access to the commercial paper market  and our borrowing costs would increase 
in addition  we would likely be required to pay a higher interest rate in future financings  and our potential pool of investor s and funding sources would likely decrease 
additionally  if our credit rating by either s p or moody s falls to non investment grade status  we will be required to provide additional support for certain customers of our wholesale business 
as of december   if our credit rating had fallen below investment grade  we would have been required to provide collateral of approximately million to continue conducting our wholesale services business with certain counterparties 
the use of derivative contracts in the normal course of our business could result in financial losses that negatively impact our results of operations 
we use derivatives  including futures  forwards and swaps  to manage our commodity and financial market risks 
we could recognize financial losses on these contracts as a result of volatility in the market values of the underlying commodities or if a counterparty fails to perform under a contract 
in the absence of actively quoted market prices and pricing information from external sources  the valuation of these financial instruments can involve management s judgment or use of estimates 
as a result  changes in the underlying assumptions or use of alternative valuation methods could adversely affect the value of the reported fair value of these contracts 
we depend on cash flow from our operations to pay dividends on our common stock 
we depend on dividends or other distributions of funds from our subsidiaries to pay dividends on our common stock 
payments of our dividends will depend on our subsidiaries earnings and other business considerations and may be subject to statutory or contractual obligations 
additionally  payment of dividends on our common stock is at the sole discretion of our board of directors 
we are vulnerable to interest rate risk with respect to our debt  which could lead to changes in interest expense 
we are subject to interest rate risk in connection with the issuance of fixed rate and variable rate debt 
in order to maintain our desired mix of fixed rate and variable rate debt  we use interest rate swap agreements and exchange fixed rate and variable rate interest payment obligations over the life of the arrangements  without exchange of the underlying principal amounts 
see the section quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in structuring such swap agreements to effectively manage our risks 
if we are unable to do so  our earnings may be reduced 
risks related to our industry transporting and storing natural gas involves numerous risks that may result in accidents and other operating risks and costs 
our gas distribution activities involve a variety of inherent hazards and operating risks  such as leaks  explosions and mechanical problems  which could cause substantial financial losses 
in addition  these risks could result in loss of human life  significant damage to property  environmental pollution  and impairment of our operations and substantial losses to us 
in accordance with customary industry practice  we maintain insurance against some  but not all  of these risks and losses 
the location of pipelines and storage facilities near populated areas  including residential areas  commercial business centers and industrial sites  could increase the level of damages resulting from these risks 
the occurrence of any of these events not fully covered by insurance could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations 
terrorist activities and the potential for military and other actions could adversely affect our businesses 
the threat of terrorism and the impact of retaliatory military and other action by the united states and its allies may lead to increased political  economic and financial market instability and volatility in the price of natural gas that could affect our operations 
in addition  future acts of terrorism could be directed against companies operating in the united states  and companies in the energy industry may face a heightened risk of exposure to acts of terrorism 
these developments have subjected our operations to increased risks 
the insurance industry has also been disrupted by these events 
as a result  the availability of insurance covering risks against which we and our competitors typically insure may be limited 
in addition  the insurance we are able to obtain may have higher deductibles  higher premiums and more restrictive policy terms 
recent investigations and events involving the energy markets have resulted in an increased level of public and regulatory scrutiny in the energy industry and in the capital markets  resulting in increased regulation and new accounting standards 
as a result of the bankruptcy and adverse financial condition affecting several entities  particularly the bankruptcy filing by enron  recently discovered accounting irregularities of various public companies and investigations by governmental authorities into energy trading activities  public companies have been under an increased amount of public and regulatory scrutiny 
recently discovered practices and accounting irregularities have caused regulators and legislators to review current accounting practices  financial disclosures and relationships between companies and their independent auditors 
new laws  such as the sarbanes oxley act of  and regulations to address these concerns have been and continue to be adopted  and capital markets and rating agencies have increased their level of scrutiny 
costs related to increased scrutiny may have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and access to capital markets 
in addition  the fasb or t he sec could enact new accounting standards that could impact the way we are required to record revenues  assets and liabilities 
these changes in accounting standards could lead to negative impacts on our reported earnings or increases in our liabilities 
item a qualitative and quantitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to risks associated with commodity prices  interest rates and credit 
commodity price risk is defined as the potential loss that we may incur as a result of changes in the fair value of a particular instrument or commodity 
interest rate risk results from our portfolio of debt and equity instruments that we issue to provide financing and liquidity for our business 
credit risk results from the extension of credit throughout all aspects of our business  but is particularly concentrated at aglc in distribution operations and in wholesale services 
our risk management committee rmc is responsible for the overall establishment of risk management policies and the monitoring of compliance with and adherence to the terms within these policies  including approval and authorization levels and delegation of these levels 
our rmc consists of senior executives who monitor commodity price risk positions  corporate exposures  credit exposures and overall results of our risk management activities  and is chaired by our chief risk officer  who is responsible for ensuring that appropriate reporting mechanisms exist for the rmc to perform its monitoring functions 
commodity price risk wholesale services this segment routinely utilizes various types of financial and other instruments to mitigate certain commodity price risks inherent in the natural gas industry 
these instruments include a variety of exchange traded and over the counter energy contracts  such as forward contracts  futures contracts  option contracts and financial swap agreements 
the financial and other derivative instruments that we use require payments to or receipt of payments from counterparties based on the differential between a fixed and variable price for the commodity  options or other contractual arrangements 
we do not designate our derivative instruments that manage our risk exposure to energy prices as hedges under sfas our determination of fair value considers various factors  including closing exchange or over the counter market price quotations  time value  and volatility factors underlying options and contractual commitments 
the maximum terms of these maturities are less than years and represent purchases long of bcf and sales short of bcf  with approximately of these scheduled to mature in less than years and the remaining in years 
the following table includes the fair values and average values of our energy marketing and risk management assets and liabilities as of december  and we base the average values on monthly averages for the months ended december  and asset average month values value at in millions calendar calendar dec

 natural gas contracts we employ a systematic approach to the evaluation and management of the risks associated with our contracts related to wholesale marketing and risk management  including var 
var is defined as the maximum potential loss in portfolio value over a specified time period that is not expected to be exceeded within a given degree of probability 
on september   our rmc approved a proposal to change sequent s day var holding period to days 
this change was made to better align our risk reporting with that of our peers in the energy industry 
we use a day and a day holding period and a confidence interval to evaluate our var exposure 
a confidence interval means there is a probability that the actual change in portfolio value will be greater than the calculated var value 
we calculate var based on the variance covariance technique 
this technique requires several assumptions for the basis of the calculation  such as price volatility  confidence interval and holding period 
our var may not be comparable to a similarly titled measure of another company because  although var is a common metric in the energy industry  there is no established industry standard for calculating var or for the assumptions underlying such calculations 
our open exposure is managed in accordance with established policies that limit market risk and require daily reporting of potential financial exposure to senior management  including the chief risk officer 
because we generally manage physical gas assets and economically protect our positions by hedging in the futures markets  our open exposure is generally minimal  permitting us to operate within relatively low var limits 
we employ daily risk testing  using both var and stress testing  to evaluate the risks of our open positions 
our management actively monitors open commodity positions and the resulting var 
we continue to maintain a relatively matched book  where our total buy volume is close to sell volume  with minimal open commodity risk 
based on a confidence interval and employing a day and a day holding period for all positions  our portfolio of positions for the months ended december  had the following day and day holding period vars in millions day day period end month average high low values represent amounts less than million 
under our risk management policy  we attempt to mitigate substantially all of our commodity price risk associated with sequent s storage gas portfolio to lock in the economic margin at the time we enter into gas purchase transactions for our stored gas 
we purchase gas for storage when the current market price we pay for gas plus the cost to store the gas is less than the market price we could receive in the future  resulting in a positive net profit margin 
we use contracts to sell gas at that future price to substantially lock in the profit margin we will ultimately realize when the stored gas is actually sold 
these contracts meet the definition of a derivative under sfas the purchase  storage and sale of natural gas is accounted for differently than the derivatives we use to mitigate the commodity price risk associated with our storage portfolio 
the difference in accounting can result in volatility in our reported net income  even though the economic margin is essentially unchanged from the date the transactions were consummated 
we do not currently use hedge accounting under sfas to account for this activity 
gas that we purchase and inject into storage is accounted for on an accrual basis  at the lower of average cost or market  as inventory in our consolidated balance sheets and is no longer marked to market following our implementation of the accounting guidance in eitf under current accounting guidance  we would recognize a loss in any period when the market price for gas is lower than the carrying amount for our purchased gas inventory 
costs to store the gas are recognized in the period the costs are incurred 
we recognize revenues and cost of gas sold in our statement of consolidated income in the period we sell gas and it is delivered out of the storage facility 
the derivatives we use to mitigate commodity price risk and substantially lock in the margin upon the sale of stored gas are accounted for at fair value and marked to market each period  with changes in fair value recognized as gains or losses in the period of change 
this difference in accounting  the accrual basis for our gas storage inventory versus mark to market accounting for the derivatives used to mitigate commodity price risk  can result in volatility in our reported net income 
over time  gains or losses on the sale of gas storage inventory will be offset by losses or gains on the derivatives  resulting in realization of the economic profit margin we expected when we entered into the transactions 
this accounting difference causes sequent s earnings on its storage gas positions to be affected by natural gas price changes  even though the economic profits remain essentially unchanged 
sequent manages underground storage for our utilities and holds certain capacity rights on its own behalf 
the underground storage is of two types o reservoir storage  where supplies are generally injected and withdrawn on a seasonal basis o salt dome high deliverability storage  where supplies may be periodically injected and withdrawn on relatively short notice energy investments southstar utilizes financial contracts to hedge the price volatility of natural gas 
southstar considers these financial contracts futures  options and swaps to be derivatives  with prices based on selected market indices 
southstar reflects the derivatives transactions that qualify as cash flow hedges in its balance sheets at the fair values of the open positions with the corresponding unrealized gain or loss included in oci 
southstar reflects the derivatives transactions that are not designated as hedges in its balance sheets with the corresponding unrealized gains or losses included in cost of sales in southstar s statement of income 
southstar also enters into weather derivative contracts for hedging purposes in order to preserve margins in the event of warmer than normal weather in the winter months 
southstar accounts for these contracts using the intrinsic value method under the guidelines of eitf  accounting for weather derivatives eitf 
more than of southstar s residential customers buy gas on a variable price basis  and buy gas on a fixed price basis 
southstar hedges the price risk associated with these fixed price sales using physical contracts and derivative instruments 
interest rate risk interest rate fluctuations expose our variable rate debt to changes in interest expense and cash flows 
our policy is to manage interest expense using a combination of fixed rate and variable rate debt 
to facilitate the achievement of desired fixed to variable rate debt ratios  agl capital entered into interest rate swaps  whereby it agreed to exchange  at specified intervals  the difference between fixed and variable amounts calculated by reference to agreed upon notional principal amounts 
these swaps are designated to hedge the fair values of million of the senior notes due  million of the senior notes due and million of the million trust preferred securities due in market value of interest rate swap derivatives dollars in millions market value as of notional amount fixed rate payment variable rate received maturity dec  dec

at december   our variable rate debt consisted of million in commercial paper  million of sequent s line of credit and million of the swapped portions of the million senior notes due  million senior notes due and million trust preferred securities 
based on outstanding borrowings at quarter end  a basis point change in market interest rates from to at december  would result in a change in annual pretax expense of million 
as of december   million of long term fixed rate obligations are scheduled to mature in the following months 
any new debt obtained to refinance this obligation would be exposed to changes in interest rates 
credit risk distribution operations aglc has a concentration of credit risk where we charge out and collect from marketers and poolers  costs for this segment 
aglc bills marketers in georgia for its services 
the credit risk exposure to marketers varies with the time of the year with exposure at its lowest in the nonpeak summer months and highest in the peak winter months 
marketers are responsible for the retail sale of natural gas to end use customers in georgia 
these retail functions include customer service  billing  collections  and the purchase and sale of the natural gas commodity 
these marketers  in turn  bill end use customers 
the provisions of aglc s tariff allow aglc to obtain security support in an amount equal to a minimum of two times a marketer s highest month s estimated bill from aglc 
for  the four largest marketers based on customer count  one of which was southstar  accounted for approximately of our ope rating margin and of distribution operations operating margin 
in addition  aglc bills intrastate delivery service to marketers in advance rather than in arrears 
we require security support in the form of cash deposits  letters of credit or surety bonds from acceptable issuers or corporate guarantees from investment grade entities 
the rmc reviews the adequacy of security support coverage  credit rating profiles of security support providers and payment status of each marketer on a monthly basis 
we believe that adequate policies and procedures have been put in place to properly quantify  manage and report on aglc s credit risk exposure to marketers 
aglc also faces potential credit risk in connection with assignments to marketers of interstate pipeline transportation and storage capacity 
although aglc assigns this capacity to marketers  in the event that a marketer fails to pay the interstate pipelines for the capacity  the interstate pipelines would in all likelihood seek repayment from aglc 
the fact that some of the interstate pipelines require marketers to maintain security for their obligations to the interstate pipelines arising out of the assigned capacity somewhat mitigates this risk 
wholesale services sequent has established credit policies to determine and monitor the creditworthiness of counterparties  as well as the quality of pledged collateral 
sequent also utilizes master netting agreements whenever possible to mitigate exposure to counterparty credit risk 
when we are engaged in more than one outstanding derivative transaction with the same counterparty and we also have a legally enforceable netting agreement with that counterparty  the net mark to market exposure represents the netting of the positive and negative exposures with that counterparty and a reasonable measure of our credit risk 
sequent also uses other netting agreements with certain counterparties with whom we conduct significant transactions 
master netting agreements enable sequent to net certain assets and liabilities by counterparty 
sequent also nets across product lines and against cash collateral provided the master netting and cash collateral agreements include such provisions 
additionally  sequent may require counterparties to pledge additional collateral when deemed necessary 
we conduct credit evaluations and obtain appropriate internal approvals for our counterparty s line of credit before any transaction with the counterparty is executed 
in most cases  the counterparty must have a minimum long term debt rating of baa from moody s and bbb from s p 
generally  we require credit enhancements by way of guaranty  cash deposit or letter of credit for transaction counterparties that do not meet the minimum ratings threshold 
sequent  which provides services to marketers and utility and industrial customers  also has a concentration of credit risk as measured by its day receivable exposure plus forward exposure 
as of december   sequent s top counterparties represented approximately of the total counterparty exposure of million  derived by adding the top counterparties exposures divided by the total of sequent s counterparties exposures 
as of december   sequent s counterparties  or the counterparties guarantors  had a weighted average s p equivalent credit rating of bbb compared to bbb at december  the s p equivalent credit rating is determined by a process of converting the lower of the s p or moody s ratings to an internal rating ranging from to  with being equivalent to aaa aaa by s p and moody s and being d or default by s p and moody s 
a counterparty that does not have an external rating is assigned an internal rating based on the strength of the financial ratios of that counterparty 
to arrive at the weighted average credit rating  the assigned internal rating for each counterparty is multiplied by the counterparty s credit exposure and summed for all counterparties 
that sum is divided by the aggregate total counterparties exposures  and this numeric value is then converted to an s p equivalent 
the following tables show sequent s commodity receivable and payable positions as of december  and gross receivables as of in millions dec

o southstar investigates potential interruptible and large commercial customers through reference checks  review of publicly available financial statements and review of commercially available credit reports 
o southstar assigns physical wholesale counterparties an internal credit rating and credit limit prior to entering into a physical transaction based on their moody s  s p and fitch rating  commercially available credit reports and audited financial statements
