item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in the following pages  management presents an analysis of united bancorp  inc s financial condition and results of operations as of and for the year ended december  as compared to prior years 
this discussion is designed to provide shareholders with a more comprehensive review of the operating results and financial position than could be obtained from an examination of the financial statements alone 
this analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related footnotes and the selected financial data included elsewhere in this report 
when used in this discussion or future filings by the company with the securities and exchange commission  or other public or shareholder communications  or in oral statements made with approval of an authorized executive officer  the words or phrases will likely result  are expected to  will continue  is anticipated  estimate  project  believe  or similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of the company wishes to caution readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date made  and to advise readers that various factors  including regional and national economic conditions  changes in levels of market interest rates  credit risks of lending activities and competitive and regulatory factors  could affect the company s financial performance and could cause the company s actual results for future periods to differ materially from those anticipated or projected 
the company is not aware of any trends  events or uncertainties that will have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on its liquidity  capital resources or operations except as discussed herein 
the company is not aware of any current recommendations by regulatory authorities that would have such effect if implemented 
the company does not undertake  and specifically disclaims  any obligation to publicly release any revisions that may be made to any forward looking statements to reflect occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events or circumstances after the date of such statements 
the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and follow general practices within the financial services industry 
the application of these principles requires management to make certain estimates  assumptions and judgements that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and footnotes 
these estimates assumptions  and judgements are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements  and as this information changes  the financial statements could reflect different estimates  assumptions  and judgements 
the procedures for assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses reflect our evaluations of credit risk after careful consideration of all information available to management 
in developing this assessment  management must rely on estimates and exercise judgement regarding matters where the ultimate outcome is unknown such as economic factors  development affecting companies in specific industries and issues with respect to single borrowers 
depending on changes in circumstances  future assessments of credit risk may yield materially different results  which may require an increase or a decrease in the allowance for loan losses 
the allowance is regularly reviewed by management to determine whether the amount is considered adequate to absorb probable losses 
this evaluation includes specific loss estimates on certain individually reviewed loans  statistical losses estimates for loan pools that are based on historical loss experience  and general loss estimates that are based on the size  quality and concentration characteristics of the various loan portfolios  adverse situations that may affect a borrower s ability to repay  and current economic and industry conditions 
also considered as part of that judgement is a review of the each bank s trend in delinquencies and loan losses  and economic factors 
the allowance for loan loss is maintained at a level believed adequate by management to absorb probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
management s evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance is an estimate based on management s current judgement about the credit quality of the loan portfolio 
while the company strives to reflect all know risk factors in its evaluation  judgement errors may occur 
financial condition overview for a third straight year  the company and its competitors faced an interest rate environment that continued at historically low levels 
a weak economic environment in did not leave the economy on firm footing for a strong in the economy had to deal with the uncertainty of war 
during the latter half of the year the economy showed mixed signs of improvement 
notwithstanding the less than optimal economic environment  your company reported record earnings for the company posted a increase in earnings per share and maintained our strong credit quality over the year 
as would be expected  our customers wanted to lock in their loan rates while the depository preferences were for shorter term certificates of deposits and liquid transaction accounts 
with interest rates at a historical low  the company did attract longer term certificates of deposits at above market interest rates 
although in today s interest rate environment the rates were slightly higher than our competitors  management feels this is a prime opportunity to lock in retail based funding for terms over months 
the company took advantage of the volatility in the bond market and realized approximately  in gains on the sale of available for sale securities in total assets in thousands

for the year ended december   the company s total assets increased  or over december  totals 
average total earning assets increased  or over  for earning assets loans gross loans totaled  at year end  representing a increase from  at year end average loans increased by  or from to installment loans increased  or  residential real estate loans decreased  or less than and commercial real estate loans decreased  or less than from december  commercial loans increased  or from december  as discussed previously  the overall slow down in the economy coupled with historical low interest rates caused management to be cautious in increasing longer term fixed rate loans during this period of uncertainty 
similar to and  consumers and businesses during the past year were extremely price and term sensitive and were looking for longer term fixed rate loans 
management priced our loan products competitively but not overly aggressive as they felt the economy would rebound over the next several years which then would most likely result in a higher interest rate environment 
based upon the asset liability model utilized by the company  management decided not to accept longer term fixed interest rate risk at historical low levels 
loan production for citizens and community during yielded a growth in both banks loan portfolios 
lower interest rates in  again caused the company to struggle to maintain its loan portfolio 
during the past three years the company was in a posture of trying to maintain its current customer relationships 
as interest rates leveled off in  the amount of refinancing requests did slow down as compared to and as a result  the company s loan portfolio ultimately grew by  or in the company s installment lending portfolio increased by from december  to december  these loans represented of the total portfolio at year end compared to at year end the targeted installment lending areas encompass the geographic areas serviced by the banks  which are diverse  thereby reducing the risk to changes in economic conditions 
competition for installment loans principally came from the captive finance companies offering low to zero percent financing for extended terms 
with a large share of the consumers being lured to the captive finance companies offering the promotional low interest rates  the remaining market share to compete for was vastly smaller 
management did not feel it was prudent  given the competition and low yields that were available  to aggressively price our installment loan product to capture this residual business 
management countered the low interest rate competition through customer service enhancements by extending our customer service hours into the evening to provide our customers with the ability to arrange financing at their convenience 
in addition  customers may access the company s internet bank and view rates and even inquire about financing 
customers merely have to e mail their loan requests and a loan officer will provide a prompt response

the commercial and commercial real estate portfolio represented approximately of the total loan portfolio at december  compared to for december  the company s commercial loan portfolio increased by  or 
however  the commercial real estate loan portfolio decreased  management is pleased with the overall increase in the combined commercial and commercial real estate loan portfolios given the lower interest rate environment and sluggish economy 
the company was able to retain the majority of its corporate accounts during a time when the industry was experiencing a high rate of loan refinancing 
to protect the company s future net interest margin and mitigate its exposure to rising interest rates in future reporting periods  certain interest rate floors and wider repricing indices were established during and that structure was updated and carried forward into and this strategy may have caused a few of our price sensitive customers to seek alternative financing arrangements in the short term 
however  in management s view  this will help preserve the company s net interest margins should interest rates increase 
residential real estate loans are comprised of  and year adjustable rate mortgages financed for family units 
the company also offers fixed rate real estate loans through our secondary market real estate mortgage program 
the fixed rate mortgages are serviced and originated by citizens but are sold immediately in the secondary market 
therefore  we have mitigated our interest rate risk and our customers enjoy the convenience of working with a local bank and are able to obtain long term fixed rate financing for their home 
as mentioned  once these loans are originated they are immediately sold in what is referred to as the secondary market 
since the loans are immediately sold  without recourse  the company does not assume any interest rate risk in this portfolio and does not have any loans held for sale 
this arrangement is quite common in banks and without such an option our customers may look elsewhere for their home financing needs 
as the overall interest rate environment remained at low levels  consumer preferences remained focused on fixed rate loan products 
given the historical low interest rates in the company s secondary market program for the second year experienced a high volume of activity

for and the interest rate environment was favorable to the fixed rate mortgage loan product and resulted in a high volume of customers refinancing 
the company recognized gains on the sale of secondary market loans of  in and  in given the increased level of sales in the secondary market in  the company s residential real estate portfolio declined  community continued their growth from the previous years  with an increase in loans of  or 
the increase this past year is due to the continued expansion of community into the fairfield county market 
community s loan growth came in commercial and commercial real estate portfolio of  and the real estate portfolio of  this growth was offset by a decrease of  in the installment portfolio 
citizens also experienced an increase in loans for total loans increased  or from december  the increase primarily came in the installment portfolio of  and commercial portfolio of  however  this increase was offset by decreases in the commercial real estate portfolio of  and the real estate portfolio of  for the allowance for loan losses represents the amount which management and the board of directors estimates is adequate to provide for probable incurred losses in the loan portfolio 
the allowance balance and the annual provision charged to expense are reviewed by management and the board of directors on a monthly basis 
the allowance calculation is determined by utilizing a risk grading model that considers borrowers past due experience  economic conditions and various other circumstances that are subject to change over time 
in general  the loan loss policy for installment loans requires a charge off if the loan reaches day delinquent status or if notice of bankruptcy is received 
the company follows lending policies  with established criteria for determining the repayment capacity of borrowers  requirements for down payments and current market appraisals or other valuations of collateral when loans are originated 
installment lending also utilizes credit scoring to help in the determination of credit quality and pricing 
the company generally recognizes interest income on the accrual basis  except for certain loans which are placed on non accrual status  when in the opinion of management  doubt exists as to collection on the loan 
the company s policy is to generally not allow loans greater than days past due to accrue interest unless the loan is both well secured and in the process of collection 
when a loan is placed on non accrual status  interest income may be recognized as cash payment is received 
management believes the current balance of the allowance for loan losses is sufficient to cover probable incurred losses 
net charge offs to average loans for the year ended was compared to for refer to provision for loan losses section for further discussion on the company s credit quality 
earning assets securities and federal funds sold the securities portfolio is comprised of us government and agency obligations  tax exempt obligations of states and political subdivisions  mortgage backed securities and certain other investments 
the company does not hold any collateralized mortgage backed securities  other than those issued by us government agencies 
the company does not hold any derivative securities 
the quality rating of most obligations of states and political subdivisions within ohio is no less than aaa  aa  or a  with all out of state bonds rated at aaa 
board policy permits the purchase of certain non rated bonds within ohio of local schools  townships and municipalities  based on known levels of credit risk 
securities available for sale at year end increased  or over  while securities held to maturity increased  or in our planning process  management s prediction for was for a steady to slightly rising interest rate environment 
for the first half of  management maintained an average of million in fed funds sold 
as the economy continued to struggle  management s posture on interest rates for the remainder of and heading into changed from one that interest rates may rise to a position that rates will go basically unchanged for the next twelve months 
therefore  by december   management had invested the company s excess liquidity in investment securities and in loans 
sources of funds deposits the company s primary source of funds is core deposits from retail and business customers 
these core deposits include all categories of interest bearing deposits  excluding certificates of deposit greater than  during  core deposits increased  or 
core deposit growth for citizens and community was  and  respectively  for the year ended december  the company continues to benefit from strong depository growth as a direct result of the expansion of community into fairfield county lancaster 
over the past several years  community has developed several large depository customers 
as of december   their eight largest depository customers accounted for approximately of community s certificate of deposits and approximately of total certificates of deposits greater than  these customers also represent of demand deposits at december  total concentration of retail funding is approximately of community s total deposits at december  this concentration does pose additional liquidity and earnings risk for community 
the earnings risks would be triggered if community would be placed in a position to sell assets below book value to meet current liquidity needs 
this risk is mitigated with community s capability to borrow wholesale funding from its correspondent banks 
management has an active asset liability committee that monitors  among other items monthly liquidity needs on a day time horizon

on a consolidated level  this concentration of funding at community represents approximately of total retail deposits at december  the company maintains strong deposit relationships with public agencies  including local school districts  city and township municipalities  public works facilities and others 
these relationships may tend to be more seasonal in nature resulting from the receipt and disbursement of state and federal grants 
these entities have maintained relatively stable balances with the company due to various funding and disbursement time frames 
certificates of deposit greater than  are not considered part of core deposits and  as such  are used as a tool to balance funding needs 
at year end  certificates of deposit greater than  decreased  or over year end totals 
certificates of deposits greater than  at both citizens and community decreased by approximately in the attraction of and retention of core deposits continues to be a challenge to the company and the overall banking industry 
alternative financial products are continuously being introduced by our competition whether through a traditional bank or brokerage services company 
however  during  the past three years  the company observed a flight to safety effect for deposit products 
as the economy weakened and the stock market declined  many consumers preferred to maintain liquidity in traditional bank product accounts 
sources of funds securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other borrowed funds other interest bearing liabilities include securities sold under agreements to repurchase  federal funds purchased  treasury  tax loan notes payable and federal home loan bank advances 
securities sold under agreements to repurchase decreased by  the average balance in securities sold under agreements to repurchase increased  from to advances from the federal home loan bank fhlb increased  from to and federal funds purchased increased  for the same period

although management can anticipate changes in interest rates  it is not possible to reliably predict the magnitude of interest rates changes 
as a result the company has established a sound asset liability management policy  which minimizes exposure to interest rate risk while maintaining an acceptable interest rate spread while insuring adequate liquidity 
the principal goal of asset liability management profit management is accomplished by establishing decision processes and control procedures for all bank assets and liabilities 
thus  the full scope of asset liability management encompasses the entire balance sheet of the company 
the broader principal components of asset liability management include  but are not limited to liquidity planning  capital planning  gap management and spread management 
by definition  liquidity is measured by the company s ability to raise cash at a reasonable cost or with a minimum amount of loss 
liquidity planning is necessary so the company will be capable of funding all obligations to its customers at all times  from meeting their immediate cash withdrawal requirements to fulfilling their short term credit needs 
capital planning is an essential portion of asset liability management  as capital is a limited bank resource  which  due to minimum capital requirements  can place possible restraints on bank growth 
capital planning refers to maintaining capital standards through effective growth management  dividend policies and asset liability strategies 
gap is defined as the dollar difference between rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities with respect to a specified time frame 
a gap has three components the asset component  the liability component  and the time component 
gap management involves the management of all three components 
gap management is defined as those actions taken to measure and match rate sensitive assets to rate sensitive liabilities 
a rate sensitive asset is any interest earning asset  which can be repriced to a market rate in a given time frame 
similarly  a rate sensitive liability is any interest bearing liability  which can have its interest rate changed to a market rate during the specified time period 
caps and collars may prevent certain loans and securities from adjusting to the market rate 
a negative gap is created when rate sensitive liabilities exceed rate sensitive assets and  conversely  a positive gap occurs when rate sensitive assets exceed rate sensitive liabilities 
in most instances  a negative gap position will cause profits to decline in a rising interest rate environment and a positive gap will cause profits to decline in a falling interest rate environment 
the company s goal is to have acceptable profits under any interest rate environment 
to avoid volatile profits as a result of interest rate fluctuations  the company attempts to match interest rate sensitivities  while pricing both the asset and liability components to yield a sufficient interest rate spread so that profits will remain relatively consistent across interest rate cycles 
management of the income statement is called spread management and is defined as managing investments  loans  and liabilities to achieve an acceptable spread between the company s return on its earning assets and its cost of funds 
gap management without consideration of interest spread can cause unacceptable low profit margins while assuring that the level of profits is steady 
spread management without consideration of gap positions can cause acceptable profits in some interest rate environments and unacceptable profits in others 
a sound asset liability management program combines gap and spread management into a single cohesive system 
management measures the company s interest rate risk by computing estimated changes in net interest income and the net portfolio value npv of its cash flows from assets  liabilities and off balance sheet items in the event of a range of assumed changes in market interest rates 
the banks senior management and the executive committee of the board of directors  comprising the asset liability committee alco review the exposure to interest rates at least quarterly 
exposure to interest rate risk is measured with the use of an interest rate sensitivity analysis to determine the change in npv in the event of hypothetical changes in interest rates  while interest rate sensitivity gap analysis is used to determine the repricing characteristics of the assets and liabilities 
npv represents the market value of portfolio equity and is equal to the market value of assets minus the market value of liabilities  with adjustments made for off balance sheet items 
computations of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions  including relative levels of market interest rates  loan prepayments and deposit decay rates  and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
further  the computations do not contemplate any actions the company may undertake in response to changes in interest rates 
the npv calculation is based on the net present value of discounted cash flows utilizing market prepayment assumptions and market rates of interest provided by surveys performed during each quarterly period  with adjustments made to reflect the shift in the treasury yield curve between the survey date and quarter end date 
certain short comings are inherent in this method of analysis presented in the computation of estimated npv 
certain assets such as adjustable rate loans have features that restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
in addition  the portion of adjustable rate loans in the company s portfolio could decrease in future periods if market interest rates remain at or decrease below current levels due to refinancing activity 
further  in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate from those assumed in the table 
finally  the ability of many borrowers to repay their adjustable rate debt may decrease in the case of an increase in interest rates 
the following tables present an analysis of the potential sensitivity of the company s net present value of its financial instruments to sudden and sustained changes in the prevailing interest rates 
dollars in thousands net portfolio value december  change in rates amount change change base  net portfolio value december  change in rates amount change change base  the projected volatility of the net present value at both december  and fall within the general guidelines established by the board of directors 
the npv table shows that in a falling interest rate environment  the npv would decrease between and 
in management s view there is a low probability that interest rates would decrease another to basis points 
in the upward change in interest rates the company s npv would decrease with a basis point interest rate increase 
in a basis point rate increase the company s npv would decrease 
this decrease is a result of the company s available for sale securities portfolio that is invested in fixed rate securities 
as interest rates increase  the market value of the securities decrease 
however  since the company currently has the ability to hold these securities to their final maturity  it would not have to incur any losses 
average balances  net interest income and yields earned and rates paid the following table provides information relating to average balance sheet information and reflects the average yield on interest earning assets and the average cost of interest bearing liabilities for the years ended december   and the yields and costs are calculated by dividing income or expense by the average balance of interest earning assets or interest bearing liabilities
