item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report 
except for historical information  the discussion in this report contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of a number of factors  including the risks described in the section titled risk factors beginning on page overview packeteer is a leading provider of application traffic management systems designed to deliver a broad set of visibility  control  and compression capabilities to enterprise customers and service providers 
for enterprise customers  the system is designed to enable it organizations to effectively align application and network resources with the priorities of the business  while providing measurable cost savings in wan infrastructure investments 
for service providers  the packeteer systems are designed to provide a platform for delivering application intelligent network services that control quality of service  or qos  expand revenue opportunities and offer compelling differentiation from other potential solutions 
the packeteer application traffic management system consists of a family of appliances with performance capabilities that make them capable of deployment within large data centers as well as smaller remote sites throughout a distributed enterprise 
each appliance can be configured to deliver the full range of application traffic management solutions  from visibility with packetseeker  to control with packetshaper  to compression with packetshaper xpress tm 
in addition  each appliance can be managed individually or in context of a completely integrated policy based application traffic management system distributed across multiple locations  using our reportcenter tm or policycenter tm software products 
packeteer s products are deployed at more than  enterprises and service providers worldwide  and are sold through an established network of more than resellers  distributors and system integrators in more than countries  complemented by our direct sales force 
our sales force and marketing efforts are used to develop brand awareness  drive demand for system solutions and support our indirect channels 
we have a limited positive operating history 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
although we earned net income of million and million in and  respectively  we incurred losses since we commenced operations in until  and profitability could be 
table of contents difficult to sustain 
we expect to continue to incur significant sales and marketing  product development and administrative expenses and  as a result  will need to generate significant quarterly revenues to maintain profitability 
with the increase in our install base  we plan to continue to invest in our customer support group 
we plan to continue to invest in the development and support of our reseller and distributor relationships 
we also plan to continue to invest in appropriate marketing campaigns and expand our international sales operations 
we plan to continue to invest in research and development activities to enhance existing products and develop new features in response to customer demands 
we will also add to our infrastructure to support our growing business 
we believe that our current value proposition  which enables our enterprise customers to get more value out of existing network resources and improved performance of their critical applications  should allow us to grow our business again in our growth rate and net revenues depend significantly on continued growth in the application traffic solutions market  our ability to develop and maintain strong partnering relationships with our indirect channel partners and our ability to expand or enhance our current product offerings or respond to technological change 
our growth in service revenues is dependent upon increasing the number of units under maintenance  which is dependent on both growing our install base and renewing existing maintenance contracts 
our future profitability and rate of growth  if any  will be directly affected by the continued acceptance of our product in the marketplace  as well as the timing and size of orders and shipments  product mix  average selling price of our products and general economic conditions 
our failure to successfully convince the market of our value proposition and maintain strong relationships with our indirect channel partners to ensure the success of their selling efforts on our behalf  would adversely impact our net revenues and operating results 
sources of revenue we derive our revenue from two sources  product revenues and service revenues 
product revenues consist primarily of sales of our application traffic management systems 
service revenues consist primarily of maintenance revenues and  to a lesser extent  training revenues 
product revenues accounted for  and of our revenues in  and  respectively 
service revenues continue to increase as our installed base grows  accounting for  and of revenues in  and  respectively 
maintenance revenues are recognized on a monthly basis  over the life of the contract 
the typical subscription and support term is twelve months  although multi year contracts are sold 
cost of revenues and operating expenses cost of revenues 
our cost of revenues excluding amortization of acquired technology consists of the cost of finished products purchased from our contract manufacturer  overhead costs and service support costs 
for finished product  we outsource all of our manufacturing to one contract manufacturer  smtc 
we design and develop a majority of the key components of our products  including printed circuit boards and software 
in addition  we determine the components that are incorporated into our products and select the appropriate suppliers of these components 
our overhead costs consist primarily of personnel related costs for our product operations and order fulfillment groups and other product costs such as warranty and fulfillment charges 
service support costs consist primarily of personnel related costs for our customer support and training groups  as well as fees paid to third party service providers to facilitate next business day replacement for end user customers located outside the united states 
additionally  we allocate overhead such as facilities  depreciation and it costs to all departments based on headcount and usage 
as such  general overhead costs are reflected in each cost of revenue and operating expense category 
we must continue to work closely with our contract manufacturer as we develop and introduce new products and try to reduce production costs for existing products 
to the extent our customer base continues to grow  we intend to continue to invest additional resources in our customer support group and expect that our fees to third party service providers will continue to increase as our international install base grows 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel expenses  allocated overhead  consultant fees and prototype expenses related to the design  
table of contents development  testing and enhancement of our products and software 
we have historically focused our research and development efforts on developing and enhancing our application traffic management solutions 
we expect that in the future  our research and development spending will increase in absolute dollars as we continue to develop and maintain competitive products and enhance our current products by adding innovative features that differentiate our products from those of our competitors 
we believe that continued investment in research and development is critical to attaining our strategic product and cost control objectives 
we expect somewhat higher absolute spending levels in the upcoming quarters to bring us more in line with our current long term business model target of of net revenues by the end of sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and related personnel expenses for those engaged in the sales  marketing and support of the product  as well as related trade show  promotional and public relations expenses and allocated overhead 
although continuing to decrease as a percentage of net revenues  sales and marketing is our largest cost  accounting for  and of net revenues for  and  respectively 
we plan to significantly increase sales and marketing headcount in  as we continue to expand our global presence 
we intend to continue to invest in appropriate sales and marketing campaigns and therefore expect sales and marketing expenses in absolute dollars to increase in the future 
particularly  we have introduced new channel marketing programs  replacing previous channel rebate programs  and will see the impact of these changes in operating expenses during we expect that sales and marketing expenses will continue to exceed our revised long term business model target of to of net revenues for at least the next twelve to eighteen months 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel expenses for administrative personnel  professional fees  allocated overhead and other general corporate expenses 
within the next twelve months  we expect general and administrative expenses to reach our long term business model target of to of revenues  although this may be delayed slightly as we continue to incur the costs of complying with the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to inventory valuation  valuation allowances including sales return reserves and allowance for doubtful accounts  and other liabilities  specifically warranty reserves 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  which are described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity 
accordingly  we believe the accounting policies below are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
revenue recognition 
the company applies the provisions of statement of position  or sop   software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions  to all transactions involving the sale of hardware and software products 
revenue is generally recognized when all of the following criteria are met as set forth in paragraph of sop persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  
table of contents the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is probable 
receipt of a customer purchase order is persuasive evidence of an arrangement 
sales through our distribution channel are evidenced by an agreement governing the relationship together with purchase orders on a transaction by transaction basis 
delivery generally occurs when product is delivered to a common carrier from packeteer or its designated fulfillment house 
for maintenance contracts  delivery is deemed to occur ratably over the contract period 
the company s fees are typically considered to be fixed or determinable at the inception of the arrangement and are negotiated at the outset of an arrangement  generally based on specific products and quantities to be delivered 
in the event payment terms are provided that differ significantly from our standard business practices  the fees are deemed to not be fixed or determinable and revenue is recognized as the fees become due and payable 
we assess collectibility based on a number of factors  including credit worthiness of the customer and past transaction history of the customer 
generally  product revenue is recognized upon shipment 
however  product revenue on sales to major new distributors is recorded based on sell through to the end user customers until such time as the company has established significant experience with the distributor s product exchange activity 
additionally  when the company introduces a new product into its distribution channel for which there is no historical customer demand or acceptance history  revenue is recognized on the basis of sell through to end user customers until such time as demand or acceptance history has been established 
the company has analyzed all of the elements included in its multiple element arrangements and has determined that it has sufficient vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe of fair value to allocate revenue to the maintenance component of its product and to training 
vsoe is based upon separate sales of maintenance renewals and training to customers 
accordingly  assuming other revenue recognition criteria are met  revenue from product sales is recognized upon delivery using the residual method in accordance with sop revenue from maintenance is recognized ratably over the maintenance term and revenue from training is recognized when the training has taken place 
to date  training revenues have not been material 
inventory valuation 
inventories consist primarily of finished goods and are stated at the lower of cost on a first in  first out basis or market 
we currently contract with smtc for the manufacture of all of our products 
we record inventory reserves for excess and obsolete inventories based on historical usage and forecasted demand 
factors which could cause our forecasted demand to prove inaccurate include our reliance on indirect sales channels and the variability of our sales cycle  the potential of announcements of our new products or enhancements to replace or shorten the life cycle of our current products  or cause customers to defer their purchases  loss of sales due to product shortages  and the potential of new or alternative technologies achieving widespread market acceptance and thereby rendering our existing products obsolete 
if future demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections  additional inventory write downs may be required and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made 
sales return reserve and allowance for doubtful accounts 
in accordance with sfas  revenue recognition when right of return exists  management must use judgment and make estimates of potential future product returns related to current period product revenue 
when providing for sales return reserves  we analyze historical return rates as we believe they are the primary indicator for estimating future returns 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue if for any period actual returns differ from our judgments or estimates 
the sales return reserve balances at december  and were  and  respectively 
we must also make estimates of the uncollectibility of accounts receivable 
when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts  we review the aged receivables on an account by account basis  taking into consideration such factors as the age of the receivables  customer history and estimated continued credit worthiness  as well as general economic and industry trends 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of 
table of contents their ability to make payments  additional allowances could be required 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was  and  at december  and  respectively 
warranty reserves 
upon shipment of products to our customers  we provide for the estimated cost to repair or replace products that may be returned under warranty 
our warranty period is typically months from the date of shipment to the end user customer 
for existing products  the reserve is estimated based on actual historical experience 
for new products  the warranty reserve is based on historical experience of similar products until such time as sufficient historical data has been collected on the new product 
factors that may impact our warranty costs in the future include our reliance on our contract manufacturer to provide quality products and the fact that our products are complex and may contain undetected defects  errors or failures in either the hardware or the software 
to date  these problems have not materially adversely affected us 
warranty reserves amounted to  and  at december  and  respectively

service costs increased to million in compared to million in both and the increased service costs in compared to and are due to increased personnel costs  as well as service fees related to an agreement previously entered into by the company for the outsourcing of certain maintenance and support services beginning late in the third quarter of we expect service costs to continue at these higher levels as a result of this outsourcing arrangement  as well as the increase in the number of units under maintenance contracts 
amortization of acquired technology amortization of acquired technology in relates to the acquired developed technologies of workfire technologies international  inc workfire 
the acquisition occurred in september due to the impairment write off in the third quarter of  which is described in greater detail below under impairment of goodwill and other intangibles  there was no amortization during or the amortization of acquired technology was million during research and development excluding the effects of stock based compensation of   and  in  and  respectively  research and development expenses increased to million in from million in and million in the increase of million  or  from to was primarily related to a million increase in personnel costs as a result of headcount increases

amortization of goodwill in connection with the workfire acquisition completed in september  we recorded goodwill and other intangible assets of approximately million  which was being amortized on a straight line basis over a three year period 
amortization of this goodwill and other intangibles totaled an aggregate of million in there was no amortization during and  due to an impairment charge discussed below 
we may have additional acquisitions in future periods that could give rise to the acquisition of additional goodwill 
under the provisions of the statement of financial accounting standards sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  any future goodwill will be accounted for using an impairment only approach 
impairment of goodwill and other intangibles in september  the company purchased workfire for approximately million  mostly in packeteer stock 
substantially all the purchase price was allocated to goodwill and other intangibles 
during the third quarter of  the company performed an assessment of the carrying value of the goodwill and other intangible assets related to its acquisition of workfire pursuant to the company s stated policy as described in note to the financial statements 
management s determination of the existence of impairment indicators included continued general economic slowing  broad based declines in the values of networking technologies and a review of current  historical and future projections of cash flows related to these assets 
the conclusion of the assessment was a determination that the carrying value of the goodwill and other intangible assets exceeded its fair value 
the fair value was determined based on company projections of the 
table of contents present value of future net cash flows to be generated over the expected lives of these assets 
accordingly  the company recorded an impairment charge of million during the third quarter of for the entire unamortized balance

we expect to experience growth in our working capital needs for at least the next twelve months in order to execute our business plan 
we anticipate that operating activities  as well as planned capital expenditures  will constitute a partial use of our cash resources 
in addition  we may utilize cash resources to fund acquisitions or investments in complementary businesses  technologies or products 
we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents and investments of million at december  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
however  we may need to raise additional funds if our estimates of revenues  working capital or capital expenditure requirements change or prove inaccurate or in order for us to respond to unforeseen technological or marketing hurdles or to take advantage of unanticipated opportunities 
these funds may not be available at the time or times needed  or available on terms acceptable to us 
if adequate funds are not available  or are not available on acceptable terms  we may not be able to take advantage of market opportunities to develop new products or to otherwise respond to competitive pressures
