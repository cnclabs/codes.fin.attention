regulatory matters the company s products are subject to regulation by  among other governmental entities  the fda and corresponding foreign agencies

table of contents comply with statutory requirements and fda regulations and is subject to various fda recordkeeping and reporting requirements and to inspections by the fda 
the testing for and preparation of required applications can be expensive  and subsequent fda review can be lengthy and uncertain 
the fda also regulates the clinical testing of medical devices 
moreover  fda clearance or approval  if granted  can include significant limitations on the indicated uses for which a product may be marketed 
failure to comply with applicable fda requirements can result in fines  civil penalties  suspensions or revocation of clearances or approvals  recalls or product seizures  operating restrictions or criminal penalties 
delays in receipt of  or failure to receive  fda clearances or approvals for the company s products for which such clearances or approvals have not yet been obtained would adversely affect the marketing of such products in the us and could adversely affect the results of future operations 
the company must obtain fda or foreign regulatory approval or clearance for marketing the company s new devices prior to their release in the us there are two primary means by which the fda permits a medical device to be marketed 
a manufacturer may seek clearance for the device by filing a k premarket notification with the fda 
to obtain such clearance  the k premarket notification must establish that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device that has been legally marketed under a k notification or was marketed before may  in some situations  a device also may be cleared by a k premarket notification through de novo classification even though there is no predicate device 
the manufacturer may not place the device into commercial distribution in the us until a substantial equivalence determination notice is issued by the fda 
the fda  however  may determine that the proposed device is not substantially equivalent  or require further information  such as additional test data or clinical data  or require the company to modify its product labeling  before it will make a finding of substantial equivalence 
the process of obtaining fda clearance of a k premarket notification  including testing  preparation of the k premarket notification and subsequent fda review  can take a number of years and require the expenditure of substantial resources 
if a manufacturer cannot establish to the fda s satisfaction that a new device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device  it will have to seek approval to market the device through the premarket approval application pma process 
this process involves preclinical studies and clinical trials 
the process of completing clinical trials  submitting a pma and obtaining fda clearance takes a number of years and requires the expenditure of substantial resources 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the fda will approve a pma 
the company s export activities and clinical investigations also are subject to the fda s jurisdiction and enforcement 
foreign regulatory approvals vary widely depending on the country 
the company has received iso certification for its murrysville  kennesaw  carlsbad  wallingford  cedar grove  nantes  herrsching  subic bay and shenzhen facilities based on criterion developed by the international organization for standardization  a quality standards organization with headquarters in geneva  switzerland 
the company has also received authorization for the same facilities  under the european union s medical device directives  to affix the ce mark to the company s products marketed throughout the world

third party reimbursement the cost of a significant portion of medical care in the us is funded by government and private insurance programs  such as medicare  medicaid and corporate health insurance programs including health maintenance organizations and managed care organizations 
countries outside of the us also have government and private insurance medical reimbursement programs that vary on a country by country basis  with varying levels of reimbursement and degrees of sophistication 
except for amounts representing an insignificant portion of the company s annual revenues less than  the company does not file claims or bill governmental programs and other third party payers directly for reimbursement of its products sold in the united states 
however  the company is still subject to laws and regulations relating to governmental programs  and violation of these laws and regulations could result in civil and criminal penalties  including fines 
the company continually strives to comply with these laws and believes that its arrangements do not violate these laws 
the company s future results of operations and financial condition could also be negatively affected by adverse changes made in the reimbursement policies for medical products under these insurance programs 
if such changes were to occur  the ability of the company s customers to obtain adequate reimbursement for the resale or rental of the company s products could be reduced 
in recent years  limitations imposed on the levels of reimbursement by both government and private insurance programs have become more prevalent 
the company has obtained procedure codes for its homecare products from the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms formerly known as the healthcare financing administration 
these procedure codes enhance the ability of medical product distributors and dealers to obtain reimbursement for providing products to patients covered by medicare 
in addition  many private insurance programs also use the cms procedure code system 
however  reimbursement levels can be reduced after a procedure code has been established 
the amount of reimbursement that a hospital can obtain under the medicare diagnosis related group drg payment system for utilizing the company s products in treating patients is a primary determinant of the revenue that can be realized by medical product distributors and dealers who resell or rent the company s hospital products 
many private insurance programs also utilize the medicare drg system 
the various uses of the company s hospital products to treat patients are provided within the drg system 
the levels of reimbursement under the drg system are also subject to review and change 
the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of the act was signed into law on december  the act reduced medical reimbursement for respiratory drugs to homecare providers effective january  additional restrictions will go into effect on january   including further and more significant reductions in the reimbursement of respiratory drugs  as well as the adjustment of certain reimbursement levels to those made under federal employee health plans 
the act also places a freeze on current reimbursement levels for durable medical equipment dme through  including certain of the company s products 
in  medicare will begin competitively bidding certain dme products and services in specified metropolitan areas 
although the specific dme products and services affected by competitive bidding have not yet been determined  it is possible that some of the company s product offerings could be included 
although these changes except for the competitive bidding provisions for which the potential impact is currently unknown to the company only directly impact certain of the company s current product offerings that represented less than of net sales during the year ended june   they will reduce reimbursement on certain other products distributed by certain of the company s customers 
these changes in medical reimbursement may have a future adverse impact on the company s results of operations  although the company believes that its product breadth and diversification and manufacturing efficiencies will help to mitigate the potential financial impact of the medical reimbursement reductions

sab no 
also incorporates into the sab codification certain sections of the sec staff s revenue recognition in financial statements frequently asked questions and answers 
sab no 
does not have a material impact on the company s financial position and results of operations since the company s revenue recognition practices previously conformed to the interpretations codified by sab no 
critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require the company to make estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported financial condition and results of operations should actual results differ 
the company bases its estimates and assumptions on the best available information and believes them to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the company believes that of its significant accounting policies  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
revenue recognition the company s revenues are recognized when title to product passes to the customer  which generally occurs upon shipment to a customer location and  in the case of rental revenue and long term service contracts  is recognized ratably over the period the product is rented or service is performed 
the company s revenue transactions are sometimes made pursuant to standard terms and conditions included in distributor agreements and customer contracts 
these contracts generally include price lists that apply to specified products shipped to customers during the terms of their agreement 
these contracts also generally include rights of return provisions that only permit customers to return sold product in the case of defective product or order entry  shipping  or similar error made by the company 
product returns  which are recorded as a reduction of net sales and cost of sales  are generally insignificant in relation to net sales 
the company accrues for estimated sales returns and allowances based on historical trends  adjusted for specific product programs and individual transactions where appropriate 
the company does not offer variable sales prices for subsequent events  all prices are fixed when customers orders are received 
certain customers and group purchasing organizations contracts provide customers with price rebates based on their level of purchases from the company 
rebates are accrued by the company as a reduction in net sales as they are earned by customers 
price discounts that may be awarded to customers for payment of invoices within specified periods are recorded as reductions to net sales at the time of payment and are generally insignificant in relation to net sales 
as part of the company s sales process  pricing discounts may be provided for large orders to support sales initiatives  including new product introductions 
in the company s domestic sales activities  a number of independent manufacturers representatives are used to sell the company s products 
these independent representatives are paid a direct commission on sales made to customers in their respective territories and are an integral component of the company s domestic sales force 
the company does not ship or sell its products to these representatives  and therefore does not recognize any revenue from transactions with these independent representatives

and  revenue recognition  provides guidance on the application of generally accepted accounting principles to selected 
table of contents revenue recognition issues 
the company has concluded that its revenue recognition policy is appropriate and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and sab nos 
and allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
provisions to increase the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable are recorded as a component of general and administrative expenses in the company s consolidated statements of operations during the fiscal years ended june    and substantially all of the company s receivables are due from healthcare product providers  distributors  and hospitals 
the company s customers are located throughout the united states and around the world 
a significant portion of products sold to providers  distributors  and hospitals  both foreign and domestic  is ultimately funded through government reimbursement programs or through private insurance programs 
as a consequence  changes in these programs can have an adverse impact on distributor and hospital liquidity and profitability 
in addition  because a concentration of market share exists in the homecare product industry in the united states among national and large regional providers  the company experiences a comparable concentration of credit risk with these customers 
the estimated allowance for uncollectible amounts is based primarily on the company s evaluation of the payment pattern  financial condition  cash flows  and credit history of its customers as well as current industry and economic conditions 
adverse changes in these factors may impair the ability of the company s customers to make payments  as a consequence  additional allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable may be required 
the company is also contingently liable  within certain limits  in the event of a customer default on unpaid installment receivables initiated by or transferred to several independent leasing companies in connection with customer leasing programs 
the company monitors the collection status of these installment receivables and provides amounts necessary for estimated losses in the allowance for doubtful accounts 
inventories and related allowance for obsolete and excess inventory inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market value and have been reduced by an allowance for excess and obsolete inventories 
provisions to increase the allowance for obsolete and excess inventory are recorded as a component of cost of goods sold in the company s consolidated statements of operations during the fiscal years ended june    and the estimated allowance is based on the company s review of inventories on hand compared to historical and estimated future usage and sales 
if it is determined that inventory on hand is in excess of estimated future usage and sales because of changes in competitive conditions  new product introductions  product obsolescence  changes in customer demand  or other reasons  additional allowances for obsolete and excess inventory may need to be provided 
the establishment of these additional allowances may have an adverse impact on earnings  depending on the extent and amount of inventory affected 
intangible assets intangible and product technology related assets are amortized to expense over their useful lives 
these useful lives are based on the company s estimates of the period that the assets will generate positive cash flows 
intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
if such carrying amounts are determined to be unrecoverable because of changes in technology  extended delays in obtaining regulatory approval  competition  significant changes in the company s strategic business objectives  utilization of the asset  or other reasons  the carrying amounts would be written down to their fair market values 
these adjustments may have an adverse impact on earnings  depending on the significance of the carrying amounts and the extent of the required adjustments 
contingencies as a normal part of its business operations  the company incurs liabilities that may be difficult to quantify precisely  such as future warranty obligations  potential liabilities relating to legal or regulatory matters  and tax exposures 
the company follows the requirements of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies  which dictate when a charge to income should be taken to accrue for a loss contingency 
these requirements necessitate the application of judgment regarding the likelihood and amount of the liability
