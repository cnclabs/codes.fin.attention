item management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that involve significant judgments and uncertainties and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
application of these policies is particularly important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
we believe the accounting policies described below meet these characteristics 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
revenue recognition the company s policy is to recognize revenue for product sales when title transfers and risk of loss has passed to the customer  which is generally upon acceptance of the product by the overseas freight carrier 
the company s policies comply with the guidance provided by staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  issued by the securities and exchange commission 
judgments are required in evaluating the credit worthiness of our customers 
credit is not extended to customers and revenue is not recognized until the company has determined that the risk of uncollectibility is minimal 
inventory valuation inventory is written down for estimated surplus and discontinued inventory items 
the amount of the write down is determined by analyzing historical and projected sales information  plans for discontinued products and other factors 
changes in sales volumes due to unexpected economic or competitive conditions are among the factors that would result in materially different amounts for this item 
allowance for doubtful accounts an allowance is established for estimated uncollectible accounts receivable 
the required allowance is determined by reviewing customer accounts and making estimates of amounts that may be uncollectible 
factors considered in determining the amount of the reserve include the age of the receivable  the financial condition of the customer  general business  economic and political conditions  and other relevant facts and circumstances 
unexpected changes in the aforementioned factors would result in materially different amounts for this item 
product warranties the company s products are sold with warranty provisions that require it to remedy deficiencies in quality or performance over a specified period of time  months  at no cost to the company s customers 
the company s policy is to establish warranty reserves at levels that represent its estimate of the costs that will be incurred to fulfill those warranty requirements at the time that revenue is recognized 
the company believes that its recorded liabilities are adequate to cover its future cost of materials  and overhead for the servicing of its products sold through that date 
if there is an actual product failure  or material or service delivery costs differ from the company s estimates  its warranty liability would need to be revised accordingly 
deferred taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of recorded assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is likely that some portion or the entire deferred tax asset will not be realized 
based upon prior taxable income and estimates of future taxable income  the company has determined that it is likely that the net deferred tax asset will not be realized in the future 
thus a full valuation allowance has been established 
if actual taxable income varies from these estimates  the company may be required to change the valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets resulting in a change in income tax benefit  which will be recorded in the consolidated statement of operations 
liquidity and capital resources the financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis  which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business

ault s engineering  documentation  safety certification reliability  sales  marketing and administrative services will remain at the minneapolis headquarters facility 
based on available funds  current plans and business conditions  management believes the company s available cash  borrowings and amounts generated from operations  will be sufficient to meet the company s cash requirements for the next months 
the assumptions underlying this belief include  among other things  that there will be no material adverse developments in the business or market in general 
there can be no assurances however that those assumed events will occur 
if management s plans are not achieved  there may be further negative effects on the results of operations and cash flows  which could have a material adverse effect on the company
