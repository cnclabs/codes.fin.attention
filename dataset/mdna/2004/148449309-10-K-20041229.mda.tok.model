forward looking statements in this report generally are accompanied by words such as anticipate  believe  estimate  or expect or similar statements 
although the company believes that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are reasonable  no assurance can be given that such expectations will prove correct 
factors that could cause the company s results to differ materially from the results discussed in such forward looking statements are discussed below 
all forward looking statements in this form k are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements in this paragraph 
during the period from august to september   two of the company s subsidiaries conducted refining operations 
by december   the company s refining subsidiaries had sold all of their refining assets 
in addition  powerine merged into another company and was no longer a subsidiary of the company 
the company s other refining subsidiaries own no refining assets and are in the process of liquidation 
as a result  the company accounted for its refining operations as discontinued operations in the company s consolidated financial statements as of september  and retroactively 
accordingly  discussion of results of refining operations has been confined to the anticipated impact  if any  of liquidation of the company s remaining inactive refining subsidiaries and contingent environmental liabilities of the company and its refining subsidiaries 
since november  the company has reacquired  shares or approximately of its previously outstanding common stock after taking into account a three for one stock split in january 
as a result of these share acquisitions  earnings and losses per outstanding share have been higher than would have been the case if no shares had been repurchased 
fiscal versus fiscal gas sales increased  as a result of the company s acquisition of appalachian gas properties on march and  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this k 
the company owned no oil and gas properties from september to march  production expenses increased as a result of the company s acquisition of appalachian gas properties on march and  see note 
the company owned no oil and gas properties from september to march  depreciation  depletion and amortization increased from fiscal to fiscal the increase was entirely attributable to depletion of the gas properties acquired by the company in march in fiscal  the company owned no oil or gas properties 
general and administrative expenses increased or from the year ended september  to the year ended september  the increase resulted primarily from increased legal costs related to the chevrontexaco lawsuit 
in addition  the company recorded a bad debt provision of for the year ended september  because of delays and uncertainties in the collection of estimated accounts receivable that were then over eighteen months old 
no similar bad debt provision was recorded for the year ended september  the company recorded no gain or loss in the value of the option it granted to delta for the year ended september because that option expired unexercised on may  for the year ended september   the company recorded a gain in the value of that option 
the company had granted delta an option to repurchase  of the delta shares held by the company at share until may  as part of the sale of its domestic oil and gas properties to delta on may  the company owned of delta on september  the company recorded no portion of the loss of network for the year ended september because the company had recorded a impairment provision on its equity investment in network and a allowance for doubtful accounts on its note receivable from network at march   reducing both amounts to zero 
the company has no obligation to fund network s future losses 
for the year ended september   network s loss was the company owns of network 
for the year ended september   the company recorded as its portion of network s loss 
the company s equity in delta s net income increased or from the year ended september  to the year ended september  the increase was caused by delta s increased net income  excluding the  gain recorded by delta on its sale of its appalachian properties to the company  notwithstanding that the company s percentage ownership of delta decreased from approximately at september  to at september  the company did not record any portion of delta s gain on the appalachian property sale because intercompany profits are eliminated under the equity method see notes and 
during the year ended september   the company sold all of its holdings in penn octane corporation penn octane  constituting  shares of common stock of penn octane  for  resulting in a gain on the sale of as a result of the sale  the company s only remaining marketable securities consist of shares of chevrontexaco  which had a market value of at september  in addition  during the year ended september   the company sold  shares of delta for  resulting in a gain of  see note 
there were no such sales during the year ended september  for the year ended september   the company recorded a tax provision of  or of pre tax book income for the period 
this provision was significantly less than that which would be obtained using the company s blended tax rate federal and state taxes combined of because the company was able to utilize its tax carryforwards and was thus able to release its valuation allowance 
the tax benefit for the year ended september  resulted primarily because of changes in the company s expectations concerning future taxable income 
fiscal versus fiscal as noted above  the company sold all of its domestic oil and gas properties to delta on may  in addition  on september   the company sold all of its oil and gas interests in romania to the operator of the romanian concessions 
as a result of these sales  the company did not directly own any operating assets in fiscal furthermore  after may   the company reduced the number of its employees from to as a result of these asset sales and the reduction in the company s employees  comparison of fiscal and fiscal operations by revenue and expense category is not meaningful 
discussion will  therefore  be limited to analysis of operations for the year ended september  with comparisons to prior year s operations only where warranted 
the company earned no oil and gas sales and incurred no oil and gas production expenses during the period from october  to september  because the company sold all of its producing oil and gas properties to delta on may  general and administrative expenses decreased  or from the year ended september  to the year ended september  primarily because of the reduction of employees from twenty seven to five 
the decrease was  however  partially offset by increased legal expenses related to the chevrontexaco litigation see note to the consolidated financial statements 
legal expenses for the year ended september  were approximately  although the company has significantly reduced its personnel costs  its public company costs audit  printing  legal compliance  stock transfer fees  stock exchange costs  etc 
continue and significant legal costs related to the chevrontexaco litigation continue and are expected in the future 
depreciation  depletion and amortization decreased  from fiscal to fiscal because the company sold all its producing oil and gas properties to delta in may and thus incurred no depletion expense during fiscal the of depreciation  depletion and amortization for fiscal consists of depreciation of the company s office equipment and furniture 
the following other income items for the year ended september  relate to and result from the sale of the company s domestic oil and gas properties to delta on may  year ended september  decrease in fair value of option granted to delta 
 equity in income loss of delta  the  and decreases in the value of the option granted to delta relates to decreases in the fair value of the option that the company granted to delta to acquire  of its shares back from the company at per share through may  that option expired unexercised on may  the fair market value of delta s option decreased primarily because of a decrease in delta s share price from may  to march  and the passage of time 
the equity in the income of delta represents the company s share of delta s estimated net income for the period from october  to september  the company owned approximately of delta at september  prior to may  the company owned only of delta and accounted for its investment in delta as available for sale securities 
commencing june   the company accounted for its investment in delta using the equity method 
see critical accounting policies below 
since the company included of delta s income loss in its own net income loss  the company s future net income losses are significantly impacted by oil and gas prices and other factors affecting delta s operations 
the company s equity in the loss of network decreased from for the year ended september  to for the year ended september  the decrease results from decreased expenses incurred by network and the fact that the company provided a impairment provision for its investment in and loan to network at march  as a result of such provisions  which reduced the book value of the company s investment in and loan to network to zero as of march   the company ceased recording any further equity in network s losses subsequent to march  for the six months ended september   network recorded a net loss of  no portion of which was recorded by the company 
the impairment provision for the company s investment in network consists of a provision related to the company s equity invested in network and a reserve provision for the company s loan receivable from network 
the company recorded the impairment provision at march  because network had not then obtained contracts for the services it offers 
network  nevertheless  continues to solicit such contracts 
if network enters into any joint venture  the company has the right but not the obligation to convert its investment in and loan receivable from network into an investment in such joint venture 
the tax benefit for the year ended september  results primarily from changes in the company s expectations concerning future taxable income 
the company increased its valuation allowance at september  by  during the year ended september   resulting in a deferred tax asset  net of of accrued income taxes on appreciation of marketable securities  of the net deferred tax asset at september  relates to income that has been recognized for tax purposes  but has not yet been recognized for financial reporting purposes 
since november of  the company has reacquired  shares or of its previously outstanding common stock after taking into account a three for one stock split in january 
as a result of these share acquisitions  earnings and losses per outstanding share have been higher than would be the case if no shares had been repurchased 
liquidity and capital resources during the year ended september   was provided by operating activities 
during the same period the company paid  for oil and gas properties and vehicles and  for dividends to stockholders 
during the same period the company received  in proceeds from the sale of part of its investment in delta petroleum corporation and  in proceeds from the sale of marketable securities 
at september   the company had  of unrestricted cash   of working capital and no long term debt 
at september   the company s long term obligations were as follows payments due by periods starting october  less than after year years years years total operating leases asset retirement obligations at the present time  the company s anticipated future cash expenditures are primarily recurring general and administrative costs  including substantial legal costs related to the chevrontexaco litigation see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item to this form k  recurring dividends and lease operating costs related to the appalachian gas properties acquired by the company see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item to this form k 
in addition  the company continues to review possible future acquisitions of oil and gas properties and  if the company is successful in such pursuits  additional expenditures would be required 
to the extent that such anticipated expenditures cannot be funded from cash flow from the company s oil and gas operations  the company can fund such expenditures using its available cash 
if the company were to make another substantial acquisition in excess of its current cash and other liquid working capital  the company believes it could fund such acquisitions by selling additional shares of delta or by renewing its previous oil and gas borrowing arrangements with an energy bank and using the related loan proceeds for the acquisition 
the company s future operations are subject to the following risks a 
litigation as noted above  the company is a defendant in three significant unsettled lawsuits 
although the company does not believe it has any material unrecorded liabilities with respect to any of these lawsuits  the company could incur significant liabilities if it ultimately is judged to be liable in these lawsuits 
this litigation could cause the company to incur significant legal costs 
if chevrontexaco were to prevail on its indemnity claim in its lawsuit note to the consolidated financial statements  the company could be held liable for the entirety of the estimated cleanup costs  a sum far in excess of the company s financial capability 
b 
exploration and production price risk the company has not hedged any of its anticipated future gas production because the cost to do so appears excessive when compared to the risk involved 
as a result  the company remains exposed to future gas price changes with respect to all of its anticipated future gas production 
such exposure could be significant given the volatility of gas prices 
for example  natural gas prices have increased over from to and could either increase or decrease a similar percentage in the future 
when the company acquired its gas properties in march  the prices being received for natural gas were to per mcf sold 
the company paid for its gas reserves acquisitions using such pricing 
if natural gas prices decrease in the future  the decrease will directly impact the company s gas sales  operating income and net income 
in addition  if gas prices are low at the end of the company s quarterly and annual reporting periods  the value of the company s gas reserve may decrease such that the company would be forced to record an impairment provision see critical accounting policies below 
c 
exploration and production operating risk all of the company s current gas properties are onshore properties with relatively low operating risk 
nevertheless  the company faces the risks encountered from operating approximately gas wells including the risk of gas leaks  resulting environmental damage  third party liability claims related to operations  including claims by landowners where the operated wells are located  as well as general operating risks 
d 
public market for the company s stock although there presently exists a market for the company s stock  such market is volatile and the company s stock is thinly traded 
this volatility may adversely affect the market price and liquidity of the company s common stock 
e 
other risks in addition to the specific risks noted above  the company is subject to general business risks  including insurance claims in excess of insurance coverage  tax liabilities resulting from tax audits and the risks associated with the increased litigation that appear to affect most corporations 
f 
market value of delta stock the company currently owns  shares of delta 
at september   the market value of such shares was  and constituted the largest asset of the company 
in the past year delta s stock price has increased significantly and fluctuated significantly over short periods of time 
if delta s stock price decreases significantly especially at a time when the company expects to liquidate some or all of its delta stock the company would be adversely affected 
g 
future of the company although the company has recently acquired interests in gas wells in pennsylvania see note  the company is smaller than most of its competitors which benefit from better fixed cost efficiencies than the company given their larger sizes and revenues 
the company s fixed costs computer system  technical skills  field offices  public company compliance costs  etc 
have consumed and are expected to continue to consume a greater percentage of the company s oil and gas revenues than do those of most of its larger competitors unless the company is able to make additional future acquisitions at favorable prices 
upon resolution of the company s outstanding litigation whether by settlement or judgment the company s directors may consider options to liquidate the company or merge the company into another company to maximize stockholder value 
if such were the case  the company would face risks concerning the value of the delta shares it owns  tax risks and risks in the liquidation of its assets 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk on march and   the company acquired interests in pennsylvania gas wells see note 
the company has not hedged its share of the expected natural gas production from these wells 
as a result  the company remains at risk with respect to such unhedged expected production 
if market prices increase  gas sales applicable to the unhedged production will increase 
if market prices decrease  gas sales and the gross margin related to such unhedged production will decrease 
at september   the company owned  shares of delta 
the stock price of delta has fluctuated significantly in the last three years and thus the market value of the company s investment in delta remains subject to significant changes in the market price of delta stock 
inflation and changing prices gas sales are determined by markets locally and worldwide and often move inversely to inflation 
in the last three years gas prices have increased over 
in prior periods such prices have decreased significantly often over a very short period of time 
since the company has not hedged its future gas production  its operating income loss and gas revenues are subject to changes in gas prices 
inflation has not had and is not expected to have a material effect on the company s results of operations

critical accounting policies the accounting policies critical to the company are as follows equity method of accounting at september   the company owned of delta and accounted for its investment in delta using the equity method of accounting 
under this method  the company is required to increase its investment in delta by its share of delta s income and decrease such investment by its share of delta s losses and any distributions from delta 
if delta incurs future losses  the company would thus include its share of such losses in its consolidated statement of operations 
in addition  the company estimates that its investment in delta exceeded the company s proportional share of delta s equity by approximately  at september  the company has allocated such excess to delta s ownership interests in offshore california leases due to the potential recovery from a lawsuit delta and other owners of offshore california leases have instituted against the united states for breach of contract 
the company is required to evaluate the recoverability of the leases periodically and write off the excess costs or reduce them to the extent they are not deemed recoverable 
in addition  if delta incurs recurring losses in the future and or the market value of its stock declines significantly  the company s investment in the future in delta could become impaired and the company would then be required to recognize the impairment 
in addition  since the company only owns of delta currently  it is possible that the company may commence accounting for its investment in delta as a marketable security if management considers the company s influence on delta to be less than significant 
although the company s interest in delta has decreased below  the company has continued to account for its investment in delta using the equity method because three of the company s directors currently comprise one third of delta s directors and thus the company can be deemed to still exercise significant influence on delta 
if the company s influence in delta continues to decrease to a level at which it no longer is considered to have a significant influence  the company would record its investment as a marketable security using the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
discontinued refining operations at september   the company had recorded net refining liabilities retained of  as noted in note to the consolidated financial statements in this form k  chevrontexaco has sued the company for environmental remediation costs that have been estimated at  in january  the united states and the state of illinois filed a motion which estimated the total costs for just one portion of the indian refinery texaco lawrenceville superfund site to be  to  the company s accounting policy with respect to contingent environmental liabilities is to record environmental liabilities when and if environmental assessment and or remediation costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated 
although the company and its special counsel do not consider an unfavorable and final outcome for the company in chevrontexaco s lawsuit to be probable  the company would be required to record additional environmental liabilities if it becomes probable that the company will incur liabilities related to chevrontexaco s claims and or other environmental liabilities and such liabilities exceed  as noted above  if such liabilities exceed the value of the company s assets  the company would not have the financial capability to pay such liabilities 
the amounts and classification of the estimated values of discontinued net refining assets and net refining liabilities retained could change significantly in the future as a result of litigation or other factors 
valuation allowance for deferred income tax asset the company evaluates whether its deferred tax assets should be reduced by a valuation allowance based upon whether realization of such deferred tax assets is or is not more likely than not 
at september   the company recorded no valuation allowance offsetting its gross deferred tax asset of at that date 
recording no valuation allowance is based upon the company s assessment that the company will generate future taxable income to utilize all of its gross deferred tax asset at september  if circumstances change such that the company no longer expects future taxable income or expects less future taxable income  the company will revise its valuation allowance  which could result in tax expense 
investment in network at march   the company recorded a impairment provision related to its investment in network 
this provision consisted of provision related to the company s equity investment in network and a provision related to the company s note receivable from network 
as a result of these impairment provisions  the company s investment in network was reduced to zero 
the impairment provisions were recorded because network had not entered into any revenue generating contracts by that date 
subsequently  network entered into its first revenue producing contract and recorded net income of for the quarter ended september  if network is able to enter into additional revenue generating contracts and generate future net income  the company may commence recording its share of network s future net income under the equity method of accounting once the company s share of such income has exceeded the company s share of unrecorded network losses since march   the date that the company ceased recognizing its share of network s losses 
full cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties the company follows the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties and equipment costs 
under this method of accounting  net capitalized costs  less related deferred income taxes  in excess of the present value of net future cash inflows oil and gas sales less production expenses from proved reserves  tax effected and discounted at  and the cost of properties not being amortized  if any  are charged to expense full cost ceiling test 
if at a future reporting date oil and gas prices decline  it is possible that the company s book value will exceed the allowable full cost ceiling and the company would have to write down its oil and gas properties 
even if oil and gas prices subsequently increase  the write down would not be restored under the full cost method of accounting 
although the company recorded no full cost ceiling provision through september   it could be required to record such a provision in the future especially if there were a significant decrease in gas prices by the end of a quarterly or annual financial reporting period
