in addition  our representatives may from time to time make oral forward looking statements 
forward looking statements provide current expectations of future events based on certain assumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact 
words such as anticipates  in the opinion  believes  intends  expects  may  will  should  could  plans  forecasts  estimates  predicts  projects  potential  continue and similar expressions may be intended to identify forward looking statements 
actual future results could differ materially from those described in the forward looking statements as a result of a variety of factors  including those discussed in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations set forth below  and  in particular  the subsection entitled risk factors in part i  item of the form k elsewhere herein 
these factors include risks related to the fact that the economy generally  and the technology and storage segments specifically  have been in a state of uncertainty making it difficult to determine if past experience is a good guide to the future and making it impossible to determine if markets will grow or shrink in the short term 
our results have been significantly impacted by a widespread slowdown in information technology investment that has also pressured the storage networking market that is the mainstay of our business 
a continued downturn in information technology spending could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 
as a result of this uncertainty  we are unable to predict with any accuracy what future results might be 
other factors affecting these forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  the following slower than expected growth of the storage networking market or the failure of our original equipment manufacturer  or oem  customers to successfully incorporate our products into their systems  our dependence on a limited number of customers and the effects of the loss of  or decrease or delays in orders by  any such customers  or the failure of such customers to make payments  the emergence of new or stronger competitors as a result of consolidation movements in the market  the timing and market acceptance of our or our oem customers new or enhanced products  the variability in the level of our backlog and the variable booking patterns of our customers  the effects of terrorist activities and resulting political or economic instability  the highly competitive nature of the markets for our products as well as pricing pressures that may result from such competitive conditions  our ability and the ability of our oem customers to keep pace with the rapid technological changes in our industry and gain market acceptance for new products and technologies  the effect of rapid migration of customers towards newer product platforms  possible transitions from board or box level to application specific integrated circuit  or asic  solutions for selected applications  a shift in unit product mix from high end to mid range products  a decrease in the average unit selling prices or an increase in the manufactured cost of our products  delays in product development  our reliance on third party suppliers and subcontractors for components and assembly  any inadequacy of our intellectual property protection or the potential for third party claims of infringement  our ability to attract and retain key technical personnel  our dependence on foreign sales and foreign produced products  the effect of acquisitions  impairment charges  and changes in tax rates or changes in accounting standards  including changes in the accounting treatment of employee stock options and contingent convertible debt

executive overview emulex corporation is the world leader in fibre channel hbas and delivers a broad range of intelligent building blocks  including embedded storage switches and input output  or i  controllers for next generation storage networking systems 
hbas are the data communication products that enable servers to connect to storage networks by offloading communication processing tasks as information is delivered and sent to the storage network 
embedded storage switches and i controllers are deployed inside storage arrays  tape libraries and other storage appliances  delivering improved performance and reliability and storage connectivity 
the demand for our fibre channel products has been driven by the demand for high performance storage networking products and solutions that support enterprise computing applications 
we rely almost exclusively on oems and sales through distribution channels for our revenue 
the market for storage networking products is concentrated among large oems and  as such  a significant portion of our revenues is generated from sales to a limited number of customers 
we have achieved growing revenue in the last three fiscal years by expanding existing products into new markets  such as mid range products  and by diversifying our product offerings with our fiscal acquisition of vixel corporation 
subsequent to out annual goodwill impairment testing  tepid demand experienced in the fourth fiscal quarter of from two of our customers  resulted in sequentially lower revenue in the fourth fiscal quarter of as compared to the third fiscal quarter of and is expected to result in lower sequential quarterly revenue in the first quarter of fiscal therefore  we may not experience revenue growth in fiscal as compared to fiscal events and circumstances at the end of june indicated that a potential impairment of goodwill had incurred 
as a result  emulex conducted a financial accounting standard  or fas   accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  analysis  as well as a fas  goodwill and other intangible assets  analysis  including a second step goodwill impairment test 
the result of the fas analysis indicated that none of our long lived assets had been impaired 
however  the fas analysis indicated that all million of our goodwill had been impaired 
this non cash impairment charge was recorded during the fourth fiscal quarter of see fiscal versus fiscal impairment of goodwill below 
despite the downturn in information technology spending in general and the computer and storage systems in particular  we believe that our investment in the storage networking market represents our greatest opportunity for revenue growth and profitability for the foreseeable future 
we continue to  and currently plan to invest in capital equipment and increase research and development spending to deliver leading edge products to our customers 
we focus on on time development of leading edge next generation products and on time deliveries of current products to our customers and high quality  cost effective manufacturing to ensure that we continue having the gross margin and operating margins necessary to sustain profitability and cash flow from operations to fund our future business needs 
business combination on november   we completed the cash tender offer by aviary acquisition corporation  our wholly owned subsidiary  to acquire all outstanding shares of vixel corporation for net per share  without interest 
approximately million shares including the associated preferred stock purchase and other rights of vixel s common stock representing approximately percent of vixel s outstanding common stock  and million shares of vixel s series b convertible preferred stock  representing all of vixel s outstanding preferred stock  were tendered in the offer 
through our wholly owned subsidiary  we accepted all validly tendered shares 
on november   we completed our acquisition of vixel by means of a short form merger of aviary acquisition corporation  with and into vixel 
we acquired vixel to expand our fibre channel product line and paid million in cash for all outstanding common stock  preferred stock and warrants of vixel corporation 
we also incurred acquisition related expenses of million in cash 
in addition  we issued million stock options with a fair value of approximately million and kept the original vesting periods for the options in exchange for the outstanding vixel options for a total acquisition value of million 
we calculated the fair value of the million stock options issued at the date of acquisition using the black scholes option pricing model 
the operations of vixel will be included within the company s one operating segment  networking products 
we accounted for the acquisition of vixel under the purchase method of accounting and recorded an expense of million for purchased in process research and development  or ipr d  during the three months ended december  the values assigned to these projects were determined by identifying projects that have economic value but that had not yet reached technological feasibility and that have no alternative future use 
the features of the related products had not been

table of contents fiscal versus fiscal net revenues 
net revenues for fiscal increased million  or percent  to million  compared to fiscal from a product line perspective  net revenues generated from our fibre channel products in were million  an increase of million  or percent  compared to  and represented substantially all of our net revenues 
the following chart details our net revenues by product line in and net revenues by product line percentage percentage of net of net increase percentage in thousands revenues revenues decrease change fibre channel ip networking other total net revenues customers whose direct net revenues  or total direct and indirect net revenues including customer specific models purchased or marketed indirectly through distributors  resellers and other third parties exceeded percent of our net revenues  were as follows net revenues by major customers direct revenues total direct and indirect revenues net revenue percentage emc hewlett packard ibm info x amounts less than percent are not presented 
customer specific models sold indirectly are included with the oem s revenues in these columns rather than as revenue for the distributors  resellers or other third parties 
direct sales to our top five customers accounted for percent of total net revenues in and  and we expect to be similarly concentrated in the future 
our net revenues from our customers can be significantly impacted by changes in the business models of our customers 
our emc specific models are sold both directly to emc and indirectly through distributors such as info x 
as a result  direct revenues attributable to emc were less than percent but direct and indirect revenues attributable to emc were greater than percent of total net revenues 
from a sales channel perspective  net revenues generated from oem customers were percent of net revenues and sales through distribution were percent in compared to net revenues from oem customers of percent and sales through distribution of percent in the following chart details our net revenues by sales channel in and net revenues by sales channel percentage percentage of net of net increase percentage in thousands revenues revenues decrease change oem distribution other total net revenues 
table of contents we believe that our net revenues are being generated primarily as a result of product certifications and qualifications with our oem customers  which take product both directly and through distribution 
in  domestic net revenues increased by million  or percent  and international net revenues increased by million  or percent  compared to the following chart details our net domestic and international revenues based on billed to location for the nine months ended june   and june  net domestic and international revenues percentage percentage of net of net increase percentage in thousands revenues revenues decrease change domestic europe pacific rim total net revenues we believe the increases in domestic and international net revenues were principally a function of the overall size of the market for fibre channel products and increased market acceptance of our fibre channel products 
we believe the increase in international net revenues at a higher rate than domestic net revenues is due to the continued increase in market acceptance of fibre channel products outside of the united states 
however  because we sell to oems and distributors who ultimately resell our products to their customers  the geographic mix of our net revenues may not be reflective of the geographic mix of end user demand or installations 
gross profit 
cost of sales included the cost of production of finished products as well as support costs and other expenses related to inventory management  manufacturing quality and order fulfillment 
in  gross profit increased million  or percent  to million from million in the increase in gross profit in compared to was primarily due to higher net revenues and volumes 
in  cost of sales included million of retention bonuses for terminated employees related to the vixel acquisition and amortized deferred stock based compensation expenses 
in  cost of sales included million of amortized deferred stock based compensation expenses 
gross margin stayed relatively flat at percent in both and we have recorded reductions related to our one gigabit per second  or gbps  inventory reserve  as previously reserved inventory was sold 
in and  the reductions  and the corresponding benefit to cost of sales  were million and million  respectively 
this reserve was initially recorded during the first quarter of fiscal engineering and development 
engineering and development expenses consisted primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel engaged in the design  development and technical support of our products 
these expenses included third party fees paid to consultants  prototype development expenses and computer services costs related to supporting computer tools used in the engineering and design process 
engineering and development expenses were million and million in and  representing percent of net revenues in each year 
engineering and development expenses increased by million  or percent  in compared to this increase was primarily due to the inclusion of the engineering and development expenses associated with our acquisition of vixel  driven in part by the addition of employees and their associated expenses 
since we completed our integration of vixel s day to day operations during the three months ended march   we no longer separately track former vixel operations 
however  the expenses associated with the former vixel operations are estimated to account for approximately million  or approximately percent of the overall million increase 
the remaining increase was due to our continued investment in fibre channel and ip engineering and development  which represented substantially all of our engineering and development efforts and expenses prior to the acquisition of vixel 
engineering and development expenses included million and million of amortized deferred stock based compensation expenses in and  respectively 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses consisted primarily of salaries  commissions and related expenses for personnel engaged in the marketing and sales of our products  as well as trade shows  product literature  promotional support costs and other advertising related costs 
selling and marketing expenses were million and million in and  representing eight percent and six percent of net revenues  respectively 
selling and marketing expenses increased by million  or percent  in  compared to this increase was primarily due to the inclusion of the selling and marketing expenses associated with our acquisition of vixel  driven in part by the addition of employees and their associated expenses 
similar to engineering and development expenses  we no longer track former vixel operations separately 
however  the expenses associated with the former vixel operations are estimated to account for approximately 
table of contents million  or approximately percent of the overall million increase 
the remaining increases in selling and marketing expenses were due primarily to increased customer promotions and channel support programs of million and additional travel and related expenses of million 
in  selling and marketing expenses included million of retention bonuses for terminated employees related to the vixel acquisition and amortized deferred stock based compensation expenses 
in  selling and marketing expenses included million of amortized deferred stock based compensation expenses 
the million increase in amortized deferred stock based compensation is due primarily to the acquisition of vixel 
as a portion of selling and marketing expenses  such as selling and marketing employees base compensation and amortized deferred stock based compensation expense  is not driven directly by net revenue increases  the expenses have not expanded at the same rate as our net revenues 
general and administrative 
ongoing general and administrative expenses consisted primarily of salaries and related expenses for executives  financial accounting support  human resources  administrative services  professional fees and other associated corporate expenses 
general and administrative expenses were million and million in and  representing five percent and percent of net revenues in each period  respectively 
general and administrative expenses decreased by million  or percent  in  compared to this decrease was primarily due to the net million charge associated with the settlements of securities class action and derivative lawsuits in the decrease was partially offset by the inclusion of the general and administrative expenses associated with our acquisition of vixel  driven in part by the addition of employees and their associated expenses 
similar to other operating expenses  we no longer track former vixel operations separately 
however  the expenses associated with the former vixel operations are estimated to offset approximately million of the overall decrease in general and administrative expenses 
in  general and administrative expenses included million of retention bonuses for terminated employees related to the vixel acquisition and amortized deferred stock based compensation expenses 
additionally  expenses in  included million for the settlement of shareholder litigation related to the vixel acquisition  based on a memo of understanding with the plaintiff in the case 
in  general and administrative expenses included million of amortized deferred stock based compensation expenses 
amortization of other intangibles 
amortization of other intangibles included the amortization of intangible assets with estimable lives 
in  amortization is for intangible assets related to the purchase of vixel and the purchase of the technology assets of trebia corporation  which were both completed during  and the purchase of giganet  completed during fiscal in  amortization is for intangible assets related to the purchase of giganet only 
the million increase in amortization of other intangibles to million in  from million in was due to the addition of amortization related to the vixel acquisition and the purchase of the technology assets of trebia corporation 
amortization of other intangibles represented five and two percent of net revenues in and  respectively 
impairment of goodwill 
the impairment of goodwill expense of million in is a full impairment of our goodwill  which originally resulted from our acquisition of vixel in november and giganet in march our annual impairment test occurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal  and the initial test indicated that no impairment existed 
however  tepid demand experienced in the fourth fiscal quarter of from two of our customers  resulted in lower than expected revenue  earnings and cash flows in the fourth fiscal quarter of and is expected to result in lower sequential revenue  earnings and cash flows in the first fiscal quarter of these events and circumstances resulted in a subsequent drop in the company s stock price  which indicated a potential impairment might have occurred 
as a result  the company conducted a fas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  analysis  as well as a fas  goodwill and other intangible assets  analysis  including a second step goodwill impairment test 
the results of the fas analysis indicated that the company s long lived assets were not impaired 
however  the fas analysis indicated that goodwill was impaired 
this determination is made at the reporting unit level and consists of two steps 
first  the fair value of emulex s only reporting unit was determined  based on a market approach  and compared to its carrying amount 
next  as the carrying amount exceeded the fair value  the second step of fas was performed 
the implied fair value of goodwill was determined by allocating the fair value in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation  in accordance with fas  business combinations 
as a result of this fas analysis  on september   the company concluded that a million charge for goodwill impairment should be recorded as of june  after recording this impairment charge  there was no goodwill remaining on the company s balance sheet as of june  the company does not believe that such impairment charges will result in any future cash expenditures 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included in part iv  item a of this annual report on form k for additional information regarding impairment of goodwill 
in process research and development expense 
the in process research and development expense of million was related to our acquisition of vixel during  and represented three percent of our net revenues 
there were no in process research and development expenses in 
table of contents nonoperating income 
nonoperating income consisted primarily of interest income  interest expense and other non operating income and expense items such as the gain on the repurchase of convertible subordinated notes 
in  our nonoperating income decreased by million to million  from nonoperating income of million in the decrease was due primarily to a decrease in the net overall gain on the repurchase of convertible subordinated notes by million to million in  from million in additionally  interest income decreased by million to million in from million in  primarily due to lower interest yields during the lower amount of percent convertible subordinated notes outstanding during  compared to  as well as the issuance of percent convertible subordinated notes during  partially offset the other decreases to nonoperating income by causing interest expense to decrease by million to million in  from million in income taxes 
in  we recorded a net loss before income taxes of million  which includes goodwill impairment and in process research and development charges of million and million  respectively 
even though we have a loss before income taxes  we have recorded income tax expense of million in  as the goodwill impairment and in process research and development charges are not deductible for tax purposes 
in  we recorded a tax provision in the amount of million  or approximately percent of our income before income taxes 
fiscal versus fiscal net revenues 
net revenues for increased million  or percent  to million  compared to from a product line perspective  net revenues generated from our fibre channel products for were million  an increase of million  or percent  compared to  and represented percent of total net revenues for we continue to believe that our net revenues from our fibre channel products are being generated primarily as a result of our product certifications and qualifications with oem customers  which take product both directly and through distribution channels 
net revenues by product line percentage of net percentage of net percentage in thousands revenues revenues increase decrease change fibre channel ip networking other total net revenues our ip networking products consist of both our iscsi products  which are currently in development  and vi products  as well as legacy clan products 
we expect that our vi  clan and traditional networking products  which have all entered end of life status  will contribute negligible revenues to succeeding quarters 
although we continue to devote resources to iscsi product development  the market remains in an early stage of development and we do not expect material revenue from these products for the foreseeable future 
in addition to direct sales  some of our larger oem customers purchased or marketed products indirectly through distributors  resellers or other third parties 
customers with direct revenues only or total direct and indirect revenues  including customer specific models purchased or marketed indirectly through distributors  resellers  and other third parties  of more than percent were as follows net revenues by major customers direct revenues total direct and indirect revenues net revenue percentage hewlett packard ibm emc amounts less than percent are not presented fiscal hewlett packard percentages represent the combined revenues of hewlett packard and compaq 
table of contents direct sales to our top five customers accounted for percent of total net revenues in compared to percent in and we expect to be similarly concentrated in the future 
our net revenues from our customers can be significantly impacted by changes in the business models of our customers 
beginning in late  emc began sourcing more product through distribution rather than purchasing it directly 
consequently  direct sales to emc have been impacted 
additionally  emc has formed an alliance with dell and entered into a worldwide manufacturing agreement with dell 
consequently  some of our models previously sold under emc specific model numbers are now being sold under dell specific model numbers  and some net revenues for emc  including direct sales to emc and their customer specific models purchased indirectly through other distribution channels  have been shifted as a result of this dell alliance 
from a distribution channel perspective  net revenues generated from oem customers were percent of net revenues and sales through distribution were percent in our oem customers may take products both directly and through distribution channels 
net revenues by distribution channel percentage percentage of net of net increase percentage in thousands revenues revenues decrease change oem distribution end user total net revenues a major factor in the increased distribution net revenues is that beginning in  one of our larger oem customers  emc  began sourcing more product through distribution rather than purchasing it directly

gross profit 
in  gross profit increased million  or percent  to million  from million in gross margin increased to percent in  compared to percent in starting in late september  some of our major customers made announcements that general economic conditions  exacerbated by the increase in economic uncertainty in the aftermath of the terrorist events of september   were having a negative impact on their financial results 
the announcements made  and forecasts received  indicated deteriorating demand for our one gbps products as these customers were expected to migrate to two gbps products for future purchases 
as a result  we recorded an estimated excess and obsolete inventory charge totaling million during the first quarter of fiscal after initially recording the one gbps reserve during the first quarter of fiscal  we have subsequently reduced this reserve by a total of million through june   as previously reserved inventory has been sold 
overall  we have been able to recover a significant portion of this reserved inventory that was not expected based on our forecasts and the forecasts received from our customers when this excess and obsolete charge was recorded 
in addition to the sale of this previously reserved 
table of contents product  we have also scrapped million of this reserved inventory and negotiated and paid cancellation charges of million through june   related to this excess and obsolete inventory charge since it was initially recorded 
in and  the reduction related to our one gbps reserve was million and million  respectively 
excluding the reduction of the excess and obsolete inventory reserve of million in  and the net excess and obsolete inventory charge of million in  gross profit would have been million and million  respectively  and gross margin would have been percent and percent  respectively 
the increase in gross profit and gross margin in compared to was also due to cost reductions for fibre channel products  higher fibre channel net revenues and volumes and changes in product mix 
also  cost of sales included million and thousand of amortized deferred stock based compensation expense for and  respectively 
engineering and development 
engineering and development expenses were million and million for and  representing and percent of net revenues  respectively 
engineering and development expenses increased by million  or percent  in compared to this increase was due to our increased investment in fibre channel and ip engineering and development  which represented substantially all of our engineering and development efforts and expenses 
engineering expenses included million and million of amortized deferred stock based compensation for and  respectively 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses were million and million for and  representing six and eight percent of net revenues  respectively 
selling and marketing expenses decreased by million  or two percent  in compared to this decrease was primarily due to a reduction in travel related expenses of million 
selling and marketing expenses included million and million of amortized deferred stock based compensation expenses for and  respectively 
as a portion of selling and marketing expenses is fixed  the expenses have not expanded at the same rate as our net revenues 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses were million and million for and representing and five percent of net revenues  respectively 
general and administrative expenses increased by million  or percent  in compared to this increase was primarily due to a net charge of million associated with the tentative settlements of securities class action and derivative lawsuits 
excluding the net charge of million  general and administrative expenses were relatively flat as a portion of general and administrative expenses is fixed and the expenses have not expanded at the same rate as our net revenues 
general and administrative expenses included million and million of amortized deferred stock based compensation expenses for and  respectively 
amortization of goodwill and other intangibles 
the amortization of intangibles was million in and amortization of goodwill and other intangibles was million in  representing two and percent of net revenues  respectively 
in  the amortization consisted of amortization for core technology and patents of million and thousand for completed technology 
in  the amortization consisted of million for goodwill and million for assembled workforce  as well as million for core technology and patents and thousand for completed technology 
we completed our transitional goodwill impairment analysis under statement during the first quarter of fiscal with no impairment charges resulting 
our annual impairment test occurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal with no impairment charges resulting 
all intangible assets relate to the purchase of giganet  completed during fiscal nonoperating income 
our nonoperating income increased by million to million in  from million in the increase is due primarily to a million gain on the repurchase of convertible subordinated notes in additionally  while lower interest rates caused lower interest percentage yields  the increase in our invested funds caused an increase in interest income to million in from million in the increase in interest income is offset in by a million increase in interest expense due to us having convertible subordinated notes outstanding for the entire year in versus only a portion of while the repurchase of convertible subordinated notes with a face value of million in the first quarter of fiscal had a proportionate reducing effect on the amount of interest expense recognized in  convertible subordinated notes were only outstanding for approximately five months in in addition  other expense included a loss of million on the sale of a strategic investment in income taxes 
in  we recorded a tax provision in the amount of million  or approximately percent of our income before income taxes 
we recorded a tax rate other than the statutory federal tax rate in principally due to state taxes in the united states 
in  we recorded a tax benefit in the amount of million 
we recorded a tax benefit at a rate other than the statutory federal tax rate in principally due to the non deductibility of goodwill amortization  and offset by the benefits related primarily to the release of the valuation allowance associated with deferred tax assets 
the release of the valuation allowance in resulted in an income tax benefit of million 
our valuation allowance was released as it was determined that it was more likely than not that the deferred tax asset related primarily to the net 
table of contents operating loss carryforwards and research credit carryforwards would be realized due to our projected future taxable income 
we expect to have a tax provision of approximately percent in future periods 
critical accounting policies the preparation of the financial statements requires estimation and judgment that affect the reported amounts of net revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances and which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
if these estimates differ significantly from actual results  the impact to the financial statements may be material 
we have identified the following as critical accounting policies revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  goodwill  other intangibles and long lived assets  inventories  income taxes and stock based compensation 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue at the time of shipment when title and risk of loss have passed  evidence of an arrangement has been obtained and collectibility has been reasonably assured 
we make certain sales through two tier distribution channels and have various distribution agreements with selected distributors and master value added resellers  or collectively the distributors 
these distribution agreements may be terminated upon written notice by either party 
additionally  these distributors are generally given privileges to return a portion of inventory and to participate in price protection and cooperative marketing programs 
therefore  we recognize revenue on our standard products sold to our distributors based on data received from the distributors and management s estimates to approximate the point that these products have been resold by the distributors 
as oem specific models sold to our distributors are governed under the related oem agreements rather than under these distribution agreements  we recognize revenue at the time of shipment to the distributors when title and risk of loss have passed  evidence of an arrangement has been obtained and collectibility has been reasonably assured 
additionally  we maintain accruals and allowances for price protection and cooperative marketing programs 
furthermore  we provide a warranty of between one and three years on our i o fibre channel and internet protocol products and provide a warranty of between one and five years on our fibre channel switching and traditional networking products 
we record a provision for estimated warranty related costs based on historical product return rates and management s estimates of expected future costs to fulfill warranty obligations 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon historical write offs as a percentage of net revenues 
although we have not experienced significant losses on accounts receivable historically  our accounts receivable are concentrated with a small number of customers 
consequently  any write off associated with one of these customers could have a significant impact on our allowance for doubtful accounts and results of operations 
goodwill  other intangibles and long lived assets 
goodwill and other intangibles resulting from the acquisitions of vixel and giganet and the purchase of the technology assets of trebia corporation are carried at cost less accumulated amortization 
for assets with determinable useful lives  amortization is computed using the straight line method over the estimated economic lives of the respective intangible assets  ranging from two to seven years 
in accordance with statement  goodwill and other intangibles that have indeterminate lives will be tested for impairment based on discounted cash flows and market capitalization at least annually  but also on an interim basis if an event or circumstance indicates that it is more likely than not that an impairment loss has been incurred 
our annual impairment test occurs during our fourth fiscal quarter each year and this initial test in fiscal indicated no impairment existed 
additionally  statement  under which the recoverability of long lived assets is assessed by determining whether the carrying value of an asset can be recovered through projected undiscounted future operating cash flows over its remaining life whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that we may not be able to recover the asset s carrying value  such as when tepid fiscal fourth quarter of demand from two of our customers and a subsequent drop in our stock price resulted in an indication of impairment to our goodwill and other intangible assets 
the amount of impairment  if any  is measured based on fair value  which is determined using projected discounted future operating cash flows 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
at the end of june  coupled with tepid fiscal fourth quarter of demand from two of our customers and a subsequent drop in our stock price  events and circumstances indicated that a potential impairment of goodwill existed 
as a result  we conducted a fas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  analysis  as well as a fas  goodwill and other intangible assets analysis  including a second step goodwill impairment test 
the result of 
table of contents the fas analysis indicated that none of our long lived assets had been impaired 
any future impairment loss could materially and adversely affect our financial position and results of operations 
however  the fas analysis indicated that all million of our goodwill was impaired 
inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value on a first in  first out basis 
we use a standard cost system for purposes of determining cost 
the standards are adjusted periodically to ensure they represent actual cost 
we regularly compare forecasted demand and the composition of the forecast against inventory on hand and open purchase commitments in an effort to ensure the carrying value of inventory does not exceed net realizable value 
accordingly  we may have to record reductions to the carrying value of excess and obsolete inventory if forecasted demand decreases 
we have previously recorded reductions to the carrying value of excess and obsolete inventory  as described in the gross profit section of the results of operations for the year ended june   compared to the year ended june  income taxes 
we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method  which recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
we regularly review historical and anticipated future pre tax results of operations to determine whether we will be able to realize the benefit of our deferred tax assets 
a valuation allowance is required to reduce the potential deferred tax asset when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the potential deferred tax asset will not be realized due to the lack of sufficient taxable income 
stock based compensation 
we account for our stock based awards to employees using the intrinsic value method

qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk 
interest rate sensitivity at june   our investment portfolio consisted primarily of fixed income securities  excluding those classified as cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash  of million see note of the consolidated financial statements 
we have the positive intent and ability to hold these securities to maturity 
currently  the carrying amount of these securities approximates fair market value 
however  the fair market value of these securities is subject to interest rate risk and would decline in value if market interest rates increased 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by percent from the levels existing as of june   the decline in the fair value of the portfolio would not be material to our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
however  if interest rates decreased and securities within our portfolio matured and were re invested in securities with lower interest rates  interest income would decrease in the future 
as of june   we have million face value percent convertible subordinated notes and million face value percent convertible subordinated notes issued and outstanding 
the fair value  based on quoted market prices  of our percent and percent convertible subordinated notes at june   was and million  respectively 
the fair value of these notes may increase or decrease due to various factors  including fluctuations in the market price of our common stock  fluctuations in market interest rates and fluctuations in general economic conditions 

table of contents foreign currency we have executed and will continue to execute transactions in foreign currencies 
as a result  we may be exposed to financial market risk resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency rates  particularly the british pound and the euro 
given the relatively small number of foreign currency transactions  we do not believe that our potential exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency rates is significant
