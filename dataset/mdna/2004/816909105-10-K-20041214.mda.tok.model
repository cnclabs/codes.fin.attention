item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we design  manufacture  install and service highly engineered equipment for use in the fabrication of semiconductor devices 
our products are focused on the wet chemical process steps in integrated circuit  or ic  manufacturing and include systems for wafer surface preparation and electrochemical deposition  or ecd  applications 
our surface preparation systems are designed for wet cleaning  stripping and etching processes  including photoresist and polymer removal and metal etching 
our ecd systems are used for copper and gold plating for the ic s internal wiring  or interconnects  solder and gold bumps for wafer level packaging applications  and other metals for various semiconductor and related applications 
our products address critical applications within the semiconductor manufacturing process  and help enable our customers to manufacture more advanced semiconductor devices that feature higher levels of performance 
the fabrication of semiconductor devices typically requires several hundred manufacturing steps  with the number of steps continuing to increase for advanced devices 
due to the breadth of our product portfolio and advanced technology capabilities  our solutions address over of these manufacturing steps 
there are several key trends in the semiconductor manufacturing industry driving growth in demand for wafer surface preparation  ecd and other advanced semiconductor equipment smaller device features for lower cost and higher performance  new materials to build more advanced semiconductor devices  increased use of mm wafers to reduce manufacturing costs  move to spray processing and single wafer processing technologies for enhanced surface preparation  and wafer level and other advanced packaging enabling smaller portable products 
as the semiconductor manufacturing process increases in complexity and production parameters become more stringent  semiconductor manufacturers have increasingly relied upon providers of semiconductor equipment that features improved process control  smaller footprint and a lower cost of ownership of their manufacturing processes 
we provide a broad suite of advanced  highly engineered  innovative processing systems that include surface preparation and ecd equipment 
our batch and single wafer processing systems for wet cleaning  stripping and etching feature our proprietary spray technology  as well as our unique process chamber designs 
our ecd equipment leverages our advanced computational techniques and capsule technology for a variety of applications including copper interconnect  seed layer enhancement and gold and solder bumps for advanced packaging 
key performance indicators our management focuses on revenues  gross margin  operating expenses and profitability in managing our business 
in addition to these financial measures found in our financial statements  we also use bookings  backlog and shipments as key performance indicators 
bookings are firm orders for which we have received written customer authorization in the fiscal period 
backlog is the balance of undelivered orders at the end of a fiscal period 
in order to be included in bookings or backlog  an order must be scheduled to ship within the next months 
backlog and forecasted orders drive our production schedule 
shipments measure how well we have met our production plan and are viewed as a primary measure of factory output 
a summary of key factors that impacted our financial performance during fiscal year includes our fiscal bookings were million as compared to million in fiscal and include over million in bookings for our new raider platform 
shipments in fiscal were million  up from million in fiscal net income was million on net sales of million in fiscal after two consecutive years of net losses 
our gross margin increased to of net sales  up from in fiscal fiscal margin was favorably impacted by the receipt of million in license initiation fees while fiscal margin was negatively impacted by a million inventory write down 
we licensed our seed layer enhancement patents to applied materials  inc and ebara  inc 
during the fiscal year and received license initiation fees totaling million in fiscal the license initiation fees are included in the bookings  shipments  net sales  gross margin and net income figures discussed above 
cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities were million at september   a decrease of million from million at september   reflecting increased trade receivables from higher shipment levels and increased inventory as we built inventory for future shipments 
results of operations the following table sets forth our consolidated results of operations for the periods indicated as a percentage of net sales year ended september  net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses selling  general and administrative research and development total operating expenses income loss from operations other income expense  net income loss before income taxes income tax provision benefit net income loss fiscal compared with fiscal and fiscal net sales year ended september  dollars in millions net sales by product line semiconductor equipment license fees by geographical distribution  percentage of net tool sales north america europe asia  including japan net sales increased million in fiscal as compared with fiscal the increase in net sales reflects the improved state of the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industries 
all product lines showed improvement in fiscal  particularly surface preparation applications and spare parts 
surface preparation net sales were favorably impacted by customer purchases of our new raider systems for single wafer cleaning applications as well as by customer purchases of our batch tools  both of which expanded our customers manufacturing capacity 
ecd net sales are primarily sales of our new raider systems for plating applications 
fiscal was also benefited by the receipt of million in license initiation fees for our seed layer enhancement patents 
both fiscal and fiscal net sales were adversely impacted by the downturn in the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industries 
customer purchases in both years were primarily focused on newer technology products  especially single wafer cleaning tools  rather than on tools that enhanced manufacturing capacity 
product sales in both years continued trends to mm equipment and single wafer platforms 
geographically  approximately half of our fiscal net sales were derived from north america  which correlates with our first shipments of the raider platform 
europe and asia each accounted for approximately of our remaining sales 
we anticipate a larger contribution from both europe and asia in fiscal gross profit year ended september  dollars in thousands gross profit    percentage of net sales gross profit increased million or in fiscal compared to fiscal fiscal gross profit decreased million or compared with fiscal gross profit of million 
we recorded a million inventory write down in fiscal due to obsolescence caused by the introduction of our new raider product 
inventory reserves were lower in fiscal as compared to fiscal because of the inventory write down in fiscal of the percentage point difference in gross margin in fiscal as compared with fiscal  the inventory write down in fiscal accounted for percentage points 
the receipt of million in license initiation fees for our seed layer enhancement patents also contributed over six points to the increase in margin in fiscal improved absorption of manufacturing costs also contributed to the improved margin in fiscal because our factory operated at higher levels of output 
the margin decrease in fiscal from fiscal is primarily attributable to the million inventory write down discussed above 
in fiscal the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industries were in a downturn 
the impact on the company was lower operating levels in the factory  which resulted in reduced manufacturing overhead absorption and higher inventory obsolescence than in fiscal changes in our sales mix also contributed to the margin change in fiscal fiscal gross margin was minimally impacted by sales of tools containing parts  valued at their written down cost basis 
fiscal gross margin was favorably impacted by approximately percentage point due to the sale of tools that contained certain parts valued at their written down cost basis 
revenues on those sales totaled million 
selling  general and administrative year ended september  dollars in thousands selling  general and administrative    percentage of net sales selling  general and administrative sg a expenses include employment costs for sales  marketing  customer support and administrative personnel as well as travel  communications  professional fees and expenses related to sales and service offices at north american and international locations 
sg a expenses decreased million in fiscal as compared with fiscal to of net sales and million in fiscal from fiscal to of net sales 
legal expenses decreased more than in fiscal compared to fiscal as a result of our efforts to bring our plaintiff litigation to conclusion and to manage our legal costs 
costs related to worldwide marketing and customer support efforts increased by approximately as a result of increased business opportunity and activity 
professional fees increased by over primarily as a result of additional accounting and legal support expense related to the current financial regulatory environment 
commission expense declined in fiscal as compared to fiscal reflecting the change in our geographic sales mix from asia to north america 
generally  commission expense is directly variable with sales and is also dependent on the geographic region of the sale as commission rates vary from region to region 
the downward trend in sg a expenses in absolute dollars from fiscal to fiscal was the result of continued cost control during the industry downturn 
reduced staffing and related expenses resulted in cost reductions  which were partially offset by increased legal expenses related to patent litigation 
fiscal sg a expenses also reflected the impact of cost reductions  including manpower reductions and lower sales commissions 
those decreases were partially offset by a million increase in legal expenses related to the protection of our intellectual property 
research and development year ended september  dollars in thousands research and development    percentage of net sales research and development r d expense consists of salaries  project materials  laboratory costs  consulting fees and other costs associated with our product development efforts 
r d expense decreased million in fiscal as compared to fiscal it decreased million in the fiscal to fiscal comparison 
r d depreciation expense declined in fiscal as compared with fiscal  as assets placed in service earlier reached the end of their estimated useful lives 
prototype expense also declined in fiscal because our focus has been meeting new customer requirements for the raider platform whereas in the prior year we were engaged in the development of this new platform 
these decreases were partially offset by increases in other operating expenses as a result of a general increase in business activity 
in fiscal  our r d projects focused on development of our single wafer megasonics processing chamber to improve particle removal for the critical cleaning market  development of the environmentally friendly hydrozone cleaning process for critical layers in the transistor formation step of ic fabrication and development of the next generation capsule ii processing chamber for post etch cleaning  wafer backside and bevel cleaning 
for our plating technology  we also developed a membrane chamber that reduces chemical consumption  which is critical for cost sensitive chip manufacturing and wafer level packaging applications 
the decline in fiscal r d expenses as compared to fiscal was attributable to continued cost control in the form of staff reductions and related expenses 
r d projects in fiscal included the further development of our raider platform for single wafer ecd and single wafer cleaning  stripping and etching in both mm and mm 
fiscal r d expenses were impacted by manpower reductions in response to the industry downturn 
this reduction was partially offset by an increase in depreciation expense as we updated our process development and demonstration laboratories 
fiscal r d projects included enhancements to our capsule processor and ecd products  the development of the sirius system and other projects focused on the industry technology trends toward smaller feature sizes and the transition to copper  wafer level packaging and mm 
our research and development expense has fluctuated from period to period in the past 
we expect such fluctuations to continue in the future  both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales  primarily due to the timing of expenditures and fluctuations in the level of net sales in a given period 
we expect to continue to fund research and development expenditures with a multi year perspective and are committed to technology leadership in our sector of the semiconductor equipment industry 
other income expense  net year ended september  in thousands interest income interest expense foreign exchange gain loss other total other income expense  net  net other income expense declined to a net expense of  in fiscal from net income of  in fiscal interest income declined from  in fiscal to  in fiscal  reflecting reduced cash investments 
in fiscal  we reported foreign exchange losses because of fluctuations in the yen  euro and the british pound 
in fiscal  we reported foreign exchange losses because of fluctuations in the yen and the euro 
in fiscal  we reported a foreign exchange gain  primarily due to fluctuations in the yen 
other income in fiscal included the proceeds we received from a settlement in connection with a patent claim that we pursued against a german manufacturer of semiconductor equipment 
other income in fiscal included a gain on the sale of an investment 
income taxes year ended september  dollars in thousands income tax provision benefit    estimated effective tax rate the estimated effective tax rate declined to in fiscal as compared to fiscal the difference in the effective tax rate compared to the prior years is primarily due to the effect of research and development credits and our foreign income exclusion  which increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal and fiscal because we were profitable in fiscal backlog and deferred revenue september  dollars in millions backlog percentage change in backlog from prior year to date period end deferred revenue percentage change in deferred revenue from prior year to date period end approximately of our current backlog is for tools on the raider platform 
deferred revenue increased million at september  as compared with september  in  our deferred revenue pool was decreasing because of reduced activity in the industry 
at september   deferred revenue was increasing because of increased shipments of raiders 
we include in backlog those customer orders for which we have written customer authorization and for which shipment is scheduled within the next months 
orders are generally subject to cancellation or rescheduling by customers with limited or no cancellation fees 
as the result of systems ordered and shipped in the same quarter  possible changes in customer delivery dates  cancellations and shipment delays  the backlog at any particular date and the bookings for any particular period are not necessarily indicative of actual revenue for any succeeding period 
in particular  during periods of downturns in the semiconductor industry we have experienced cancellations and significant shipment delays 
deferred profit included in our current liabilities is derived from deferred revenue  which relates to equipment shipped to customers that has not been accepted by the customer  less the deferred cost of goods sold  including warranty and installation  and commission expenses 
deferred revenue is not included in orders backlog 
liquidity and capital resources selected components of cash flows from operating activities from our consolidated cash flows statements follow year ended september  in thousands net income loss    income tax refund receivable    inventories   accounts payable    trade receivables    deferred profit    operating activities 
in fiscal  cash provided by operations was million 
the primary sources of cash from operating activities were the receipt of the million in license initiation fees included in income from operations and the receipt of over million in income tax refunds 
inventory increased million and accounts payable increased million as a result of our plan to reduce manufacturing cycle times and provide faster deliveries to our customers by stocking components that will help shorten our lead times 
trade receivables increased due to higher shipment levels in fiscal the increase in deferred profit was the result of revenue and expenses deferred on our new raider products pending final customer acceptance 
in fiscal  our deferred profit pool was being relieved as we received customer acceptances on new tools deferred in prior periods 
in fiscal  we shipped new tools to new customers which  under our revenue recognition policy guided by sab  requires that revenue and the associated expenses be deferred  until customer acceptance is received 
in fiscal  we used cash from operations of million 
the net loss in fiscal  adjusted for non cash benefits  most notably the inventory write down of million  depreciation and amortization and decreases in tax assets  was the primary factor in the use of cash from operating activities in fiscal changes in working capital accounts  notably decreases in trades receivables  provided million in cash 
this was offset by an increase in income tax refund receivable of million related to the net operating loss  and reductions in deferred profit of million  the result of the receipt of customer acceptances on new tools deferred in prior periods that were not offset by new tool deferrals 
during fiscal  the primary source of cash was the net collection of trade receivables of million 
in fiscal the semiconductor equipment industry was in a downturn 
as is typical during a downturn  collections exceeded the generation of new trade receivables 
the downturn and subsequent declining sales  operating levels and net operating loss  along with the income tax refund receivable  partially offset the net increase in cash provided by operating activities 
investing activities 
in fiscal  investing activities included million in purchases of factory equipment and other property and net cash used for the purchase of marketable securities of million 
we invested an additional million in our development and demonstration laboratories in fiscal by transferring finished goods inventory to property  plant and equipment 
we also invested million in intangible assets  primarily in our patent portfolio 
we used million to acquire property  plant and equipment  primarily laboratory equipment in fiscal consistent with our focus on product and process development  we further invested in our development and demonstration laboratories with a transfer of million in finished goods inventory to property  plant and equipment in fiscal cash invested in intangible assets  primarily intellectual property rights  was approximately million in fiscal cash used in investing activities in fiscal consisted mainly of the million used to purchase property  plant and equipment  primarily laboratory equipment and a new office building in cambridge  uk for our european headquarters 
we further invested million in our development and demonstration laboratories by transferring finished goods to property  plant and equipment in fiscal we also invested million in intangible assets  primarily our patent portfolio 
financing activities 
financing activities consist primarily of cash received from stock option exercises of million offset by long term debt repayments of  during fiscal cash used in financing activities for fiscal primarily consisted of net repayments on long term borrowings of  compared to  in long term debt repayments in fiscal the exercise of stock options in fiscal provided  in cash compared to  in fiscal the following commitments as of september   incurred in the normal course of business  have been included in the consolidated financial statements with the exception of purchase order commitments and operating lease obligations  which are properly excluded under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
they are disclosed in the following table in order to provide a consolidated picture of our financial position and liquidity 
we do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as such  we are not exposed to the types of financing  liquidity  market or credit risks that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
payments due by period total less than year years years after years in thousands long term debt   operating leases  purchase order commitments   total commitments     we have agreements with entities owned by mr 
raymon f 
thompson  our chairman  to lease aircraft and an aircraft hangar 
under these agreements  rent expense was approximately   and  for the years ended september    and  respectively 
the current rental rate is approximately  per month for both the aircraft and the hangar  the lease terms are month to month and therefore are not included in the above table 
in fiscal  we incurred  of leasehold improvements to leased aircraft 
the improvements are being amortized over a three year period 
as of september   our principal sources of liquidity consisted of approximately million of cash and cash equivalents  million in marketable securities and incoming cash generated from operations 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we finalized a million revolving credit facility which was negotiated in fiscal we believe that we have sufficient cash and cash equivalents  along with funds expected to be generated from operations to meet operating expenses and planned capital expenditures through fiscal and into the foreseeable future 
we estimate capital expenditures will be between million and million during the next months 
we currently have an effective shelf registration statement  which registers the offer and sale of up to an aggregate million of our securities 
if additional financial resources are required in the future  we expect either to issue securities from the shelf registration statement or to issue other financial instruments  whichever management deems advisable 
of course  there can be no assurance that in the future we will be able to issue additional common stock or other financial instruments 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  inventories  warranty obligations  bad debts  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  financing operations  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies and estimates affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
revenue recognition is significant because revenue is a key component of our results of operations 
we recognize revenue under the guidance for staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition 
under this method  revenue is recognized only when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
our product sales generally contain substantive customer acceptance provisions 
sales of new products to new or existing customers are not recognized until customer acceptance 
likewise  sales of existing products to new customer environments are not recognized until customer acceptance 
if multiple elements exist  sales of existing products into existing customer environments are treated as such in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
the amount of revenue recognized in multiple element arrangements is the lesser of the fair value of the equipment or the contracted amount that was due or payable upon title transfer 
the revenue for elements other than equipment is recorded in deferred profit and is recognized when the remaining goods and or services are delivered or performed 
revenue related to service is recognized upon completion of performance of the service or ratably over the life of the related service contract 
spare parts sales are recognized upon shipment when title and risk of loss pass to the customer 
unearned revenue from service contract agreements is included in customer advances in the current liability section of the balance sheet 
in addition  the timing of certain expenses  such as cost of goods sold  including installation and warranty  and commission expenses coincides with the recognition of the related revenues 
we follow specific guidelines in measuring revenue  however  certain judgments such as the definition of a new customer environment and new acceptance criteria or if installation is perfunctory may be required in the application of our revenue policy 
inventories 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market on a first in  first out basis 
accordingly  we write down the carrying value of inventories for estimated obsolescence and future marketability 
on a quarterly basis  we compare historical and projected sales and usage of raw materials and parts and our assumptions about future use of raw materials  parts and finished goods with our forecast  market demand and industry conditions to determine potential obsolescence or whether the inventory on hand represents excess quantities 
as a result of our analysis  we record reserves impacting cost of goods sold  if appropriate 
if actual future use  demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by us  additional inventory valuation write downs may be required 
warranty obligations 
we provide for the estimated cost of equipment warranties when the related revenue is recognized 
we track individual warranties on a tool by tool basis and develop estimated rates by equipment class 
the rates are used to estimate the warranty accrual for a given specific piece of equipment 
these rates are revised periodically to reflect current cost trends due to the current life cycle of that product class 
the warranty accrual is reduced by actual costs of providing the warranty or if a balance is remaining at the end of the warranty period  then that amount is also written off 
warranty accrual expense impacts primarily cost of goods sold 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we record expense as a component of selling  general and administrative within the statements of operations 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  due to the cyclicality of the industries we serve or for other reasons  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances and expense may be required 
likewise  if we are successfully able to collect on an amount presumed to be uncollectible  the allowance for doubtful accounts and the related expense may be reduced 
in general  it takes longer to collect payment in the capital equipment industry than in certain other industries 
days sales outstanding dso of our peers  ranges between approximately and days in our industry 
impairment of investments in marketable securities 
we record an investment impairment charge when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
any investment impairment would be recorded in the financial statements as other expense 
deferred tax assets 
we make estimates to determine the amount of our deferred tax assets that we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  however  should we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  a decrease in the deferred tax asset would negatively impact our results of operations  particularly the income tax provision  in the period such determination was made 
litigation in june  we filed suit against novellus systems  inc novellus in the united states district court for the district of oregon for infringement of our us patent no 
 the patent 
novellus counterclaimed against us for infringement of four of their patents 
on october   we entered into a settlement agreement the settlement agreement with novellus settling this patent litigation 
pursuant to the settlement agreement  novellus paid us million and both parties agreed to additional covenants and restrictions related to the patents in dispute in the litigation and the resolution of future patent disputes 
the parties agreed to dismiss with prejudice their respective claims in the litigation  without either party admitting any liability 
in addition  novellus provided covenants not to sue semitool at any time in the future for any infringement of the four counterclaim patents it asserted in the litigation based on acts either prior to  or after  the effective date of the settlement agreement  and semitool provided a covenant not to sue novellus for any infringement of the patent based on acts which occurred prior to the effective date of the settlement agreement 
the parties also agreed to certain dispute resolution procedures in the event of any future patent disputes 
we are subject to other legal proceedings and claims which have arisen in the ordinary course of our business and have not reached final adjudication 
although there can be no assurance as to the ultimate disposition of these matters  it is the opinion of our management  based upon the information available at this time  that the currently expected outcome of these matters  individually or in the aggregate  will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
factors that might affect our future financial results and stock price set forth below are risks and uncertainties that could negatively impact our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows  and could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward looking statements contained in this annual report on form k 
these risks and uncertainties could also cause our stock price to decline 
we have incurred significant net losses  our future revenues are inherently unpredictable  and we may be unable to maintain profitability 
we incurred net losses of million and million in our fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
our operating results for future periods are subject to numerous uncertainties  and we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain the profitability that we achieved in fiscal it is possible that in future quarters our operating results will again decrease from the previous quarter or fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors 
in this event  the trading price of our common stock could significantly decline 
our quarterly operating results have varied in the past and will continue to vary significantly in the future  causing volatility in our stock price 
our quarterly operating results have varied significantly in the past and will continue to do so in the future  which will continue to cause our common stock price to fluctuate in the future 
some of the factors that may influence our operating results and subject our common stock to price and volume fluctuations include changes in customer demand for our systems  which is influenced by economic conditions  technological developments in the semiconductor industry  and the announcement or release of enhancements to existing products or new product offerings by our competitors  demand for products that use semiconductors  market acceptance of our systems and changes in our product offerings  size and timing of orders from customers  customer cancellations or delays in orders  shipments  and installations  customer delays or rejections of final acceptance of our shipments  changes in average selling price and product mix  failure to ship an anticipated number of systems in the quarter  product development costs  including research  development  engineering and marketing expenses associated with our introduction of new products and product enhancements  sudden changes in component prices or availability  manufacturing inefficiencies caused by uneven or unpredictable order patterns  reducing our gross margins  costs associated with protecting our intellectual property  level of our fixed expenses relative to our net sales  and fluctuating costs associated with our international organization and international sales  including currency exchange rate fluctuations 
during any quarter  a significant portion of our net sales may be derived from the sale of a relatively small number of high priced systems 
the selling prices of our systems range from under  to in excess of million 
accordingly  a small change in the number and or mix of tools we sell may cause significant changes in our operating results 
variations in the amount of time it takes for our customers to accept our systems may cause our operating results to fluctuate 
securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin sab revenue recognition provides guidance on the recognition of revenue for sales that involve contractual customer acceptance provisions and product installation commitments 
timing of revenue recognition from the sale of new systems  sales to new customers and installation services is subject to the length of time required to achieve customer acceptance after shipment  which could cause our operating results to vary from period to period 
in light of these factors and the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry  we expect to continue to experience significant fluctuations in quarterly and annual operating results 
moreover  many of our expenses are fixed in the short term which  together with the need for continued investment in research and development  marketing and customer support  limits our ability to reduce expenses quickly in response to declines in sales 
as a result  net sales could decline and harm our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows  which could cause our operating results to be below the public market analysts or investors expectations and the market price of our stock could decline 
cyclicality in the semiconductor industry and the semiconductor equipment industry has historically led to substantial variations in demand for our products and consequently our operating results  and will continue to do so 
our operating results are subject to significant variation due to the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry s business cycles  the timing  length and volatility of which are difficult to predict 
our business depends upon the capital spending of semiconductor manufacturers  which  in turn  depends upon the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductors and products using semiconductors 
the semiconductor industry has historically been cyclical because of sudden changes in demand for semiconductors and manufacturing capacity  including capacity utilizing the latest technology 
the rate of changes in demand  including end user demand  is accelerating  and the effect of these changes on us is occurring sooner  exacerbating the volatility of these cycles 
these changes have affected the timing and amounts of customers capital equipment purchases and investments in new technology  and continue to affect our net sales  gross margin and results of operations 
during downturns  the semiconductor equipment industry typically experiences a more pronounced percentage decrease in revenues than the semiconductor industry 
the semiconductor industry recently experienced a downturn that began in fiscal  which seriously affected our net sales  gross margin and results of operations 
in addition  during downturns  it is critical to appropriately align our cost structure with prevailing market conditions  to minimize the effect of such downturns on our operations  and in particular  to continue to maintain our core research and development programs 
if we are unable to align our cost structure in response to such downturns on a timely basis  or if such implementation has an adverse impact on our business  then our financial condition or results of operations may be negatively affected to an even larger extent during industry downturns 
conversely  during an upturn or periods of increasing demand for semiconductor manufacturing equipment  we may not have sufficient manufacturing capacity and inventory to meet customer demand 
during an upturn we would be unable to predict the sustainability of a recovery  if any  and or the industry s rate of growth in such a recovery  both of which will be affected by many factors 
if we are unable to effectively manage our resources and production capacity during an industry upturn  there could be a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we have experienced periods of rapid growth and decline in operating levels  and if we are not able to successfully manage these significant fluctuations  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be significantly harmed 
we have experienced periods of significant growth and decline in net sales 
our net sales increased from approximately million in fiscal to approximately million in fiscal however  there have been other periods of significant declines in net sales  for example  our net sales decreased from approximately million for fiscal to approximately million for fiscal in addition  our consolidated orders backlog increased from approximately million at september  to million at september  if we are unable to effectively manage periods of rapid decline or sales growth  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be significantly harmed 
our deferred revenue and orders backlog may not result in future net sales 
revenue recognition guidance requires that revenue and the associated profit from the sale of newly introduced systems  systems sales to new customers and substantive installation obligations that are subject to contractual customer acceptance provisions are deferred until the customer has acknowledged its acceptance of the system 
if the system does not meet the agreed specifications and the customer refuses to accept the system  the deferred revenue and associated deferred profit will not be realized and we may be required to refund any cash payments previously received from the customer  which may harm our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
order backlog does not necessarily include all sales needed to achieve net revenue expectations for a subsequent period 
we schedule the production of our systems based in part upon order backlog 
due to possible customer changes in delivery schedules and cancellations of orders  our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of actual sales for any succeeding period 
in addition  while we evaluate each customer order on a case by case basis to determine qualification for inclusion in backlog  there can be no assurance that amounts included in backlog will ultimately result in future sales 
a reduction in backlog during any particular period  or the failure of our backlog to result in future sales  could harm our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
our continued high spending levels on research and development and the need to maintain a high level of customer service and support may  under certain circumstances  harm our results of operations 
in order to remain competitive  we must maintain a high level of investment in research and development  marketing and customer service while controlling operating expenses 
our industry is characterized by the need for continued investment in research and development as well as a high level of worldwide customer service and support 
as a result of our need to maintain spending levels in these areas  our operating results could be materially harmed if our net sales fall below expectations 
in addition  because of our emphasis on research and development and technological innovation  our operating costs may increase further in the future  which could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flow in any given period 
there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make a high level of investment in research and development  marketing and customer service while controlling operating expenses or that our products will continue to be viewed as competitive as a result of technological advances by competitors or changes in semiconductor processing technology 
such competitive pressures may necessitate significant price reductions by us or result in lost orders  which could harm our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we depend on our key customers with whom we do not have long term contracts 
any loss  cancellation  reduction or delay in purchases by  or failure to collect receivables from  these customers could harm our business 
typically  we do not have long term contracts with our customers 
as a result  our agreements with our customers do not provide any assurance of future sales 
sales are made pursuant to purchase orders  which can be cancelled or delayed by our customers at any time 
our customers are not required to make minimum purchases from us  or make purchases at any particular time  our customers are free to purchase products from our competitors  and our customers can stop purchasing our products at any time without penalty 
our ten largest customers accounted for approximately  and of net sales in fiscal  and  respectively 
there is a limited number of mostly large companies operating in the highly concentrated  capital intensive semiconductor industry 
accordingly  we expect that we will continue to depend on a relatively small number of large companies for a significant portion of our net sales 
although the composition of the group of largest customers may change from year to year  the loss of  or a significant curtailment of purchases by  one or more of our key customers or the delay or cancellation of a large order could cause our net sales to decline significantly  which would harm our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
similarly  delays in payments by large customers could have a significant impact on our cash flows 
intense competition in the markets in which we operate may adversely affect our market share and reduce demand for our products 
we face substantial competition from established competitors  some of which have greater financial  marketing  technical and other resources  broader and integrated product lines  more extensive customer support capabilities  and larger sales organizations and customer bases 
we may also face competition from new market entrants 
our ability to compete successfully in the future depends on a number of factors  including system performance  quality and reliability  upfront price and maintenance costs of using our products  ability to ship products on time to meet customers demands  timeliness and quality of technical support service  and our success in developing new and enhanced products 
due to intense competitive conditions in the semiconductor equipment industry  we have from time to time selectively reduced prices on our systems in order to protect our market share  and competitive pressures may necessitate further price reductions 
periodically  our competitors announce the introduction of new products or lower prices which can affect our customers decisions to purchase our systems  the prices we can charge for our systems and the level of discounts we grant our customers 
moreover  there has been significant merger and acquisition activity among our competitors and potential competitors 
these combinations may provide our competitors and potential competitors with a competitive advantage over us by enabling them to more rapidly expand their product offerings and service capabilities to meet a broader range of customer needs 
many of our customers and potential customers are relatively large companies that require global support and service for their semiconductor manufacturing equipment 
our larger competitors have more extensive infrastructures  which could place us at a disadvantage when competing for the business of global semiconductor device manufacturers 
we expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their products 
we cannot assure you that our competitors will not develop enhancements to  or future generations of  competitive products that will offer superior price  performance and or cost of ownership features  or that new processes or technologies will not emerge that render our products less competitive or obsolete 
as a result of the substantial investment required to evaluate and select capital equipment and integrate it into a production line  we believe that once a manufacturer has selected certain capital equipment from a particular vendor  there is a tendency for the manufacturer to rely upon that vendor to provide equipment for the specific production line application and may seek to rely upon that vendor to meet other capital equipment requirements 
accordingly  we may be at a competitive disadvantage for a protracted period of time with respect to a particular customer if that customer utilizes a competitor s manufacturing equipment 
we have recently introduced our new raider platform  which may fail to gain market acceptance from the market 
we have recently introduced our new raider platform and intend to leverage this core technology platform  which is based on our prior platforms  to expand our product portfolio and increase market opportunities 
we expect that revenue from this new product platform will account for a significant portion of our revenue in the future 
accordingly  acceptance of this product platform is critical to our future success 
factors that may affect the market acceptance of this product include the performance  price and total cost of ownership of the product  and the availability  functionality and price of competing products and technologies 
failure of this new product to maintain and achieve widespread market acceptance would significantly impair our revenue growth 
rapid technological change could make our products and inventories obsolete or unmarketable for specific applications 
we operate in an industry that is subject to evolving industry standards  rapid technological changes  rapid changes in customer demands and the rapid introduction of new  higher performance systems with shorter product life cycles 
for example  recent trends in semiconductor manufacturing include the move towards smaller device features to lower cost and improve performance  the use of new materials  such as copper  to achieve higher speed and performance of an integrated circuit  and the migration to mm diameter wafers from mm diameter wafers to increase productivity and reduce costs 
as a result of these and other trends in our industry  we expect to continue to make significant investments in research and development 
although  historically  we have had adequate funds from operations to devote to research and development  there can be no assurance that we will have funds available  and in sufficient quantities  in the future for such research and development activities 
introductions of new products by us or our competitors could adversely affect sales of our existing products and may cause these existing products and related inventories to become obsolete or unmarketable  or otherwise cause our customers to defer or cancel orders for existing products 
we may be unable to develop and introduce new products or enhancements to our existing products on a timely basis or in a manner which satisfies customer needs or achieves widespread market acceptance 
any significant delay in releasing new systems could adversely affect our reputation  give a competitor a first to market advantage or allow a competitor to achieve greater market share 
these effects of rapid technological change could harm our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
our results of operations may suffer if we do not effectively manage our inventories or are required to write down our inventories due to changing market demands for our products 
to achieve commercial success with our products  we need to manage our inventory of component parts and finished goods effectively to meet changing customer product and volume requirements 
some of our products and supplies  have in the past and may in the future  become obsolete  while in inventory  due to rapidly changing customer specifications or slowdowns in demand for existing products ahead of new product introductions by us or our competitors 
if we are not successfully able to manage our inventory  including our spare parts inventory  we may need to write off unsaleable or obsolete inventory  which would adversely affect our results of operations 
for example  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we wrote down inventory by million primarily due to a change in forecasted demand for certain of our products due to the introduction of our new raider platform 
our dependence on key suppliers could delay shipments and increase our costs 
some components and subassemblies included in our products are obtained from a single source or a limited group of suppliers 
the loss of  or disruption in  shipments from these sole or limited source suppliers could  in the short term  adversely affect our business and results of operations 
further  a significant increase in the price of one or more of these components could harm our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
our future success depends on international sales 
our net sales attributable to customers outside the united states as a percentage of our total net sales were approximately  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
we expect net sales outside the united states to continue to represent a significant portion of our future net sales 
sales to customers outside the united states are subject to various risks  including exposure to currency fluctuations and related derivatives used to hedge such fluctuations  exposure of foreign accounts to foreign exchange translations  political and economic instability  including terrorism  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other market barriers  potentially adverse tax consequences  outbreaks of hostilities  particularly in israel  korea  taiwan or china  difficulties in managing foreign sales representatives and distributors  and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign branch operations 
a substantial portion of our international sales are denominated in us dollars 
therefore  if the us dollar rises in value in relation to foreign currencies  our systems will become more expensive to customers outside the united states and less competitive with systems produced by competitors outside the united states 
such conditions could negatively impact our international sales 
although we endeavor to meet technical standards established by foreign standards setting organizations  there can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with changes in foreign standards in the future 
variations in the amount of time it takes for us to sell our systems may cause fluctuations in our operating results  which could cause our stock price to decline 
variations in the length of our sales cycles could cause our net sales  and thus our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows  to fluctuate widely from period to period 
this variation could cause our stock price to decline 
our customers generally take a long time to evaluate many of our products before committing to a purchase 
we expend significant resources educating and providing information to our prospective customers regarding the uses and benefits of our systems 
the length of time it takes us to make a sale depends upon many factors  including the efforts of our sales force and our independent sales representatives and distributors  the complexity of our customers fabrication processes  the internal technical capabilities and sophistication of the customer  and capital spending by our customers 
because of the number of factors influencing the sales cycle  the period between our initial contact with a potential customer and the time when we recognize revenue from our customer  if ever  varies widely in length 
our sales cycle typically ranges from one month to two years 
occasionally our sales cycle can be even longer  particularly with our international customers and new technologies 
the subsequent build cycle  or the time it takes us to build a product to customer specifications after receiving an order  typically ranges from one to six months 
during these cycles  we commit substantial resources to our sales efforts in advance of receiving any revenue  and we may never receive any revenue from a customer despite our sales efforts 
when a customer purchases one of our systems  that customer often evaluates the performance of the system for a lengthy period before considering the purchase of more systems 
the number of additional products a customer may purchase from us  if any  depends on many factors  including the customer s capacity requirements 
the period between a customer s initial purchase and subsequent purchases  if any  often varies from two to twelve months or longer  and variations in length of this period could cause further fluctuations in our business  financial condition  results of operations  cash flows  and possibly our stock price 
if we deliver systems with defects  our credibility may be harmed  sales and market acceptance of our systems may decrease and we may incur liabilities associated with those defects 
our systems are complex and sometimes have contained errors  defects and software bugs when introduced 
if we deliver systems with errors  defects or software bugs  our credibility and the market acceptance and sales of our systems could be harmed 
further  if our systems contain errors  defects or software bugs  we may be required to expend significant capital and resources to alleviate such problems 
defects could also lead to commercial and or product liability as a result of lawsuits against us or against our customers 
we have agreed to product liability indemnities 
our product and commercial liability insurance policies currently provide only limited coverage per claim 
in the event of a successful product liability and or commercial claim  we could be obligated to pay damages that may not be covered by insurance or that are significantly in excess of our insurance limits 
failure of our products to gain market acceptance would adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to provide customer service and support 
we believe that our growth prospects depend upon our ability to gain customer acceptance of our products and technology 
market acceptance of products depends upon numerous factors  including compatibility with existing manufacturing processes and products  perceived advantages over competing products and the level of customer service available to support such products 
moreover  manufacturers often rely on a limited number of equipment vendors to meet their manufacturing equipment needs 
as a result  market acceptance of our products may be adversely affected to the extent potential customers utilize a competitor s manufacturing equipment 
there can be no assurance that growth in sales of new products will continue or that we will be successful in obtaining broad market acceptance of our systems and technology 
we expect to spend a significant amount of time and resources to develop new products and refine existing products 
in light of the long product development cycles inherent in our industry  these expenditures will be made well in advance of the prospect of deriving revenue from the sale of any new systems 
our ability to commercially introduce and successfully market any new products is subject to a wide variety of challenges during this development cycle  including start up delays  design defects and other matters that could delay the introduction of these systems to the marketplace 
as a result  if we do not achieve market acceptance of new products  we may not be able to realize sufficient sales of our systems in order to recoup research and development expenditures 
the failure of any of our new products to achieve market acceptance would harm our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we manufacture substantially all of our equipment at a single facility and any prolonged disruption in the operations of that facility could have a material adverse effect on our net sales 
we manufacture substantially all of our equipment in our primary manufacturing facility located in kalispell  montana 
our manufacturing processes are highly complex and require sophisticated and costly equipment and a specially designed facility 
as a result  any prolonged disruption in the operations of our manufacturing facility  whether due to technical or labor difficulties  destruction or damage as a result of a fire or any other reason  could seriously harm our ability to satisfy our customer order deadlines 
if we cannot provide timely delivery of our systems  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows would be adversely affected to a significant extent 
if we require additional capital in the future  it may not be available  or if available  on terms acceptable to us 
we believe that our existing balances of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  our cash flow from operations  and a revolving credit facility we finalized in november will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
we may  however  require additional financing to fund our operations in the future 
the significant contraction in the capital markets  particularly in the technology sector  may make it difficult for us to raise additional capital in the future  if and when it is required  especially if we are unable to maintain profitability 
if adequate capital is not available to us as required  or is not available on favorable terms  our shareholders may be subject to significant dilution in their ownership if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities  or we could be required to significantly reduce or restructure our business operations 
the above mentioned revolving credit facility provides for up to million in borrowings 
there is no assurance that this facility will be sufficient to meet our cash needs 
compliance with environmental regulations may be very costly  and the failure to comply could result in liabilities  fines and cessation of our business 
we are subject to a variety of governmental regulations related to the discharge or disposal of toxic  volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals 
current or future regulations could require us to purchase expensive equipment or to incur other substantial expenses to comply with environmental regulations 
any failure by us to control the use of  or adequately restrict the discharge or disposal of  hazardous substances could subject us to future liabilities  result in fines being imposed on us  or result in the suspension of production or cessation of our manufacturing operations 
if the protection of our proprietary rights is inadequate  our business could be harmed 
we place a strong emphasis on the technically innovative features of our products and  where available  we generally seek patent protection for those features 
we currently hold us patents  some with pending foreign counterparts  have approximately us patent applications pending and intend to file additional patent applications  as we deem appropriate 
there can be no assurance that patents will issue from any of our pending applications or that existing or future patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology 
while we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through patents  copyrights and non disclosure agreements  there can be no assurance that we will be able to protect our technology  or that competitors will not be able to develop similar technology independently 
in addition  the laws of certain foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
moreover  there can be no assurance that our existing or future patents will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  or that the rights granted thereunder will provide meaningful competitive advantages to us 
in any of such events  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be harmed 
there has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in semiconductor related industries 
although we are not aware of any potential infringement by our products of any patents or proprietary rights of others  further commercialization of our technology could provoke claims of infringement from third parties 
in addition  we rely on trade secret protection for our technology  in part through confidentiality agreements with our employees  consultants and third parties 
however  employees may breach these agreements  and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach 
in any case  others may come to know about or determine our trade secrets through a variety of methods 
now and in the future  litigation may be necessary to enforce patents issued to us  to protect trade secrets or know how owned by us or to defend us against claimed infringement of the rights of others and to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others 
any such litigation could cause us to accrue substantial cost or divert our management or resources  which by itself could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
further  adverse determinations in such litigation could result in our loss of proprietary rights  subject us to significant liabilities and damages to third parties  require us to seek licenses from third parties or prevent us from manufacturing or selling our products  any of which could harm our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
our efforts to protect our intellectual property may be less effective in some foreign countries where intellectual property rights are not as well protected as in the united states 
in fiscal  approximately of our net sales were derived from sales in foreign countries  including certain countries in asia such as singapore  taiwan  japan  china and korea 
the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the united states  and many us companies have encountered substantial problems in protecting their proprietary rights against infringement in such countries  some of which are countries in which we have sold and continue to sell systems 
for example  taiwan and china are not signatories to the patent cooperation treaty  which is designed to specify rules and methods for defending intellectual property internationally 
in taiwan and china  the publication of a patent prior to its filing would invalidate the ability of a company to obtain a patent 
similarly  in contrast to the united states where the contents of patent applications remain confidential during the patent prosecution process  the contents of a patent are published upon filing which provides competitors an advanced view of the contents of applications prior to the establishment of patent rights 
there is a risk that our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate in these countries 
our competitors in these countries may independently develop similar technology or duplicate our systems 
if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property in these countries  it would be easier for our competitors to sell competing products in those countries 
anti takeover provisions in our charter documents could adversely affect the rights of the holders of our common stock 
our articles of incorporation authorize our board of directors to issue preferred stock in one or more series and to fix the rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions granted to or imposed upon any unissued shares of preferred stock and to fix the number of shares constituting any series and the designations of such series  without further vote or action by the shareholders 
we have no present plans to issue any preferred stock in order to deter a takeover and or adopt additional anti takeover measures 
if such actions are taken in the future  they may make a change of control difficult  even if a change of control would be beneficial to our shareholders 
any anti takeover provisions  including any issuance of preferred stock  could have the effect of discouraging a third party from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to gain control of us 
in addition  these provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
we must attract and retain key personnel to help direct and support our future growth 
competition for such personnel in our industry can be high 
our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our key management  engineering  sales and marketing  customer support  finance and manufacturing personnel 
the loss of any of these key personnel  particularly our chairman  president and chief executive officer  raymon f 
thompson  who would be extremely difficult to replace  could harm our business and operating results 
we do not have key person life insurance on any of our executives 
further  to support future growth  we will need to attract and retain additional qualified employees 
competition for such personnel can be intense  and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified senior executives and other employees 
new accounting pronouncements in march  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
eitf provides guidance on other than temporary impairment models for marketable debt and equity securities accounted for under sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  and sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments held by not for profit organizations  and non marketable equity securities accounted for under the cost method 
the eitf developed a basic three step model to evaluate whether an investment is other than temporarily impaired 
on september   the fasb approved the issuance of fasb staff position fsp eitf  which delays the effective date until additional guidance is issued for the application of the recognition and measurement provisions of eitf to investments in securities that are impaired 
we do not expect the adoption of eitf to have a material effect our results of operations or financial condition 
on march   the fasb issued an exposure draft  share based payment an amendment of fasb statement no 
and the proposed statement addresses the accounting for transactions in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for a equity instruments of the enterprise or b liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprise s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
the proposed statement would eliminate the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using apb no 
 and generally would require instead that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method 
as proposed  companies would be required to recognize an expense for compensation cost related to share based payment arrangements including stock options and employee stock purchase plans 
as proposed  the new rules would be applied on a modified prospective basis as defined in the exposure draft  and would be effective for public companies for periods beginning after june  we are currently evaluating option valuation methodologies and assumptions in light of the evolving accounting standards related to employee stock options 
current estimates of option values using the black scholes method may not be indicative of results from valuation methodologies ultimately adopted in the final rules 
in september  the eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 the effect of contingently convertible debt on diluted earnings per share 
eitf requires that all issued securities that have embedded conversion features that are contingently exercisable upon the occurrence of a market price condition should be in the calculation of diluted earnings per share  regardless of whether the market price trigger has been met 
eitf will become effective in the period when the proposed amendment to sfas no 
 earnings per share  becomes effective 
we currently have no contingently convertible debt and the adoption of eitf is not expected to materially impact diluted earnings per share 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks market risks relating to our operations result primarily from changes in interest rate and changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
as of september   we had approximately million in long term debt and no short term debt 
our long term debt bears interest at a fixed rate 
as a result  changes in the fixed rate interest market would change the estimated fair value of the fixed rate long term debt 
however  we believe that a change in the long term interest rate would not have a material effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
all of our international operations are subject to inherent risks in conducting business abroad  including fluctuation in the relative value of currencies 
we manage this risk and attempt to reduce such exposure through an economic hedge using short term forward exchange contracts 
at september   we held forward contracts to sell japanese yen with a total face value of million and a total market value of million 
the impact of movements in currency exchange rates on forward contracts is offset to the extent of receivables denominated in japanese yen 
the effect of a change in foreign exchange rates on hedged transactions involving japanese yen forward exchange contracts and the underlying transactions would not be material to our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes
