off balance sheet arrangements

capital expenditures 
management anticipates that new non hotel based restaurants will cost between million and million per restaurant to build and open depending upon the location and available tenant allowances 
hotel based restaurants may involve remodeling existing facilities  substantial capital contributions from the hotel operators and other factors which will cause the cost to us of opening such restaurants to be less than our cost to build and open non hotel based restaurants 
capital expenditures were million in  million in and million in capital expenditures in fiscal are expected to be between million and million  primarily for the development of new restaurants  capital replacements and refurbishing existing restaurants 
the amount of actual capital expenditures will be dependent upon  among other things  the proportion of free standing versus hotel based properties as hotel based restaurants are expected to generally require lower capital investment on our part 
in addition  if we open more  or less  restaurants than we currently anticipate  our capital requirements will increase  or decrease  accordingly 
in october  we signed a lease for an owned hotel based restaurant in bethesda  maryland 
the restaurant opened january  construction of the restaurant was paid for through a million tenant improvement allowance 
convertible securities and warrants 
in order to finance restaurant openings during and  we conducted an offering of common stock  convertible preferred stock and warrants during and entered into a joint operating arrangement and loan in the offering provided net proceeds of approximately million 
the offering consisted of a private placement of  shares of common stock   shares of series i convertible preferred stock  shares of series ii convertible preferred stock   five year warrants and  five year warrants 
the aggregate sales price of those securities was the series i convertible preferred stock was converted into  shares of common stock in july the series ii convertible preferred stock is convertible into common stock commencing one year from the date of issuance at the greater of i per share  or ii of the average closing price of our common stock for the five trading days immediately prior to the date of conversion  provided  however  that the conversion price shall in no event exceed per share 
the series ii convertible preferred stock is entitled to receive an annual dividend equal to per share payable on conversion or redemption in cash or  at our option  in common stock at the then applicable conversion price 
the series ii convertible preferred stock is subject to redemption  in whole or in part  at our option on or after the second anniversary of issuance at  per share 
accrued dividends in arrears total  at december  and  at december  the warrants were exercisable to purchase common stock at a price of per share commencing three years from the date of issuance and ending five years from the date of issuance 
the warrants expired in june the warrants were exercisable to purchase common stock at a price of per share commencing three years from the date of issuance and ending five years from the date of issuance 
the warrants expired in june starwood alliance in july  we completed a transaction with starwood hotels and resorts worldwide  inc pursuant to which we sold  shares of restricted common stock and  stock warrants at to starwood for  concurrently  we sold an additional  shares of restricted common stock and  stock purchase warrants for to other strategic investors for  proceeds reflected in the financial statements are net of transaction costs 
in conjunction with the investment by starwood  we and starwood entered into a development agreement under which we and starwood agreed to jointly develop our restaurant properties in starwood hotels 
under the starwood development agreement  either we or starwood may propose to develop a daily grill  grill or city bar and grill restaurant in a starwood hotel property 
if the parties agree in principal to the development of a restaurant  the parties will attempt to negotiate either a management agreement or a license agreement with respect to the operation of the restaurant 
so long as starwood continues to meet certain development thresholds set forth in the development agreement  we are prohibited from developing  managing  operating or licensing our restaurants in any hotel owned  managed or franchised by a person or entity  other than starwood  with more than locations operated under a single brand 
existing hotel based restaurants are excluded from the exclusive right of starwood 
the development thresholds required to be satisfied to maintain starwood s exclusive development rights require  generally  the signing of an average of one management agreement or license agreement with respect to daily grill restaurants annually over the life of the development agreement  the signing of one management agreement or license agreement in any two year period with respect to grill restaurants  and the signing of an aggregate average of three management agreements or license agreements with respect to all of our restaurants annually over the life of the development agreement 
satisfaction of the thresholds set forth in the development agreement are determined on each anniversary of the development agreement 
with respect to satisfaction of the specific thresholds applying to daily grill restaurants and grill restaurants  the failure to satisfy the development thresholds with respect to those individual brands will terminate the exclusivity provisions relative to such brand but will not affect the exclusivity rights as to the other brand or in general 
under the development agreement  we are obligated to issue to starwood warrants to acquire a number of shares of our common stock equal to four percent of the outstanding shares upon the attainment of certain development milestones 
such warrants are issuable upon execution of management agreements and or license agreements relating to the development and operation  and the commencement of operation  of an aggregate of five  ten  fifteen and twenty of our branded restaurants 
if the market price of our common stock on the date the warrants are to be issued is greater than the market price on the date of the development agreement  the warrants will be exercisable at a price equal to the greater of of the market price as of the date such warrant becomes issuable  or the market price on the date of the development agreement 
if the market price of our common stock on the date the warrants are to be issued is less than the market price on the date of the development agreement  the warrants will be exercisable at a price equal to the market price as of the date such warrants become issuable 
the warrants will be exercisable for a period of five years 
in addition to the warrants described above  if and when the aggregate number of restaurants operated under the development agreement exceeds of the total daily grill  grill and city grill branded restaurants  we will be obligated to issue to starwood a warrant to purchase a number of shares of our common stock equal to of the outstanding shares on that date exercisable for a period of five years at a price equal to the market price at that date 
on each anniversary of that date at which the restaurants operated under the development agreement continues to exceed the threshold  for so long as the development agreement remains effective  we shall issue to starwood additional warrants to purchase of the outstanding shares on that date at an exercise price equal to the market price on that date 
following the events of september   starwood substantially curtailed new development activities and only two management agreements have  as yet  been entered into under the development agreement 
certain portions of the exclusivity agreement have terminated due to the lack of performance on starwood s part 
termination of pizzeria uno operations in july  we sold our south plainfield  new jersey pizza restaurant for net proceeds of  in april  we sold our cherry hill  new jersey pizza restaurant for net proceeds of  restaurant closings in april  we closed our encino  california daily grill restaurant when the lease expired 
assets of the restaurant were sold for net proceeds of short term financing requirements management believes that we have adequate resources on hand and operating cash flow to sustain operations for at least the following months through march we project increased operating cash flows in which  when added to existing cash balances  will allow us to meet all operating  investing and financing needs 
such projections are based on sales increases due to store openings  as well as modest increases in same store sales 
we do not expect sales to decrease in fiscal year as was the case in fiscal  however  a further deterioration in the economy and the hospitality industry could impact projected cash flows 
management believes it can respond to a decrease in sales through cost controls  reductions in discretionary capital improvements and borrowings under the existing credit facility 
in order to fund the opening of additional restaurants  we might require additional capital that might be raised through the issuance of debt or equity securities  or the formation of additional investment loan arrangements  or a combination thereof 
we presently have no commitments in that regard 
see business business expansion and management s discussion and analysis certain factors affecting future operating results 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
principals of consolidation and minority interests our restaurant operations are conducted through multiple wholly owned subsidiaries as well as through four majority owned limited liability companies and through a owned joint venture 
our consolidated financial statements include balance sheet and income statement items  after eliminating intercompany accounts and transactions  of each wholly owned and majority owned subsidiary 
the proportionate interest of the earnings or loss of majority owned subsidiaries attributable to the minority owners of those subsidiaries is reflected in a single statement of operations entry  with minority interests in earnings being a reduction in net income and minority interests in losses being an increase in net income 
the proportionate interest in the equity of majority owned subsidiaries attributable to the minority owners of those subsidiaries is reflected as a single balance sheet entry between liabilities and stockholders equity 
our interest in the owned joint venture that operates the universal citywalk daily grill is accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
under the equity method  the balance sheet and statement of operations items of that joint venture are not included on our financial statements 
instead  we report on our statement of operations a single line entry reflecting our proportionate interest in the earnings or loss of the joint venture  provided that the aggregate net losses from the joint venture do not exceed our equity in the venture 
our equity in the joint venture is reflected as an investment on the balance sheet that is adjusted  but not below zero  to reflect our aggregate share of net income and losses of the venture 
impairment of long lived assets we review all long lived assets on a regular basis to determine if there has been an impairment in the value of those assets 
if  upon review  it is determined that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable  we will record a charge to earnings and reduce the value of the asset on the balance sheet to the amount determined to be recoverable 
for purposes of evaluating recoverability of long lived assets  the recoverability test is performed using undiscounted cash flows of the individual restaurants and consolidated undiscounted net cash flows for long lived assets not identifiable to individual restaurants compared to the related carrying value 
if the undiscounted operating income is less than the carrying value  the amount of the impairment  if any  will be determined by comparing the carrying value of each asset with its fair value 
fair value is generally based on a discounted cash flow analysis 
based on our review of our presently operating restaurants and other long lived assets  during the fiscal year ended december   we recorded no impairments of our long lived assets 
valuation of accounts receivable we review all of our accounts receivable on a regular basis to determine the collectability of each account based on age  response to collection efforts  and other factors 
we establish a reserve for those accounts where collection seems doubtful 
if a determination is made that the customer will definitely not pay  the amount is written off against the reserve 
based on our review at december   the current reserve for uncollectable accounts receivable is adequate 
certain factors affecting future operating results this form k contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of our actual results could differ materially from those set forth in the forward looking statements 
certain factors that might cause such a difference include the following adverse weather conditions and other conditions affecting agricultural output which may cause shortages of key food ingredients and volatility of food prices and which  in turn  may reduce operating margins  changes in consumer tastes  demographics and adverse economic conditions which may result in reduced frequency of dining at our restaurants  the dependence on key personnel and ability to attract and retain qualified management and restaurant personnel to support existing operations and future growth  regulatory developments  particularly relating to labor matters ie  minimum wage  health insurance and other benefit requirements  health and safety conditions  service of alcoholic beverages and taxation  which could increase the cost of restaurant operations  establishment of market position and consumer acceptance in new markets in light of intense competition in the restaurant industry and the geographic separation of senior management from such markets  potential delays in securing sites for new restaurants and delays in opening restaurants which may entail additional costs and lower revenues than would otherwise exist in the absence of such delays  the availability of capital to fund future restaurant openings  rising energy costs and the occurrence of rolling blackouts in california which may result in higher occupancy costs and periodic restaurant closures  potential increases in meat prices with corresponding decreases in operating margins 
in addition to the foregoing  the following specific factors may affect the company s future operating results the anticipated opening of additional daily grill and grill locations is expected to result in the incurrence of various pre opening expenses and high initial operating costs which may adversely impact earnings during the first year of operations of such restaurants 
however  management anticipates that each of such operations can be operated profitably within the first year of operations and that the opening of each of the restaurants presently contemplated will improve revenues and profitability 
in order to better manage the cost of our workers compensation expense  commencing in  we have altered our workers compensation coverage to substantially increase our per event and aggregate deductibles 
as a result  we expect to substantially reduce our recurring cost of workers compensation insurance 
on the other hand  we will have substantially higher exposure to losses resulting from claims under that policy should those claims exceed our prior deductible levels 
the employees of the chicago restaurant are members of the hotel employees and restaurant employees union afl cio 
the union contract covering the chicago grill was recently signed extending it until august under the new union contract  our labor costs are expected to increase slightly 
future accounting requirements in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin requires that upon issuance of a guarantee  the entity ie  the guarantor must recognize a liability for the fair value of the obligation it assumes under that guarantee 
fin s provisions for initial recognition and measurement were effective on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  consistent with the provisions of fin  we have applied this statement prospectively 
as required by fin  the disclosure provisions  when required  have been included in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended adoption of this statement has had no impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure which amends sfas no 
sfas no 
provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based compensation 
in addition  sfas no 
amends the disclosure requirements of sfas to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based compensation and the effect of the method on reported results of operations 
as we have not elected to change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
all disclosure requirements of sfas no 
have been adopted and are reflected in these financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  which addresses the consolidation of business enterprises variable interest entities to which the usual condition ownership of a majority voting interest of consolidation does not apply 
the interpretation focuses on financial interests that indicate control 
it concludes that in the absence of clear control through voting interests  a company s exposure variable interest to the economic risks and potential rewards from the variable interest entity s assets and activities are the best evidence of control 
variable interests are rights and obligations that convey economic gains or losses from changes in the values of the variable interest entity s assets and liabilities 
variable interest may arise from financial instruments  service contracts  nonvoting ownership interests and other arrangements 
if an enterprise holds a majority of the variable interests of an entity  it would be considered the primary beneficiary 
the primary beneficiary would be required to include the assets  liabilities and the results of operations of the variable interest entity in its financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued a revision to fin to address certain implementation issues 
the provisions of this interpretation will be effective for the company for interim periods ending after march  the company is in the process of reviewing its various agreements in order to determine if any variable interest entities exist which would require consolidation 
at this point the company does not believe that it holds the majority of the variable interests of an entity whereby it would be considered the primary beneficiary 
accordingly  the adoption of this interpretation is not expected to have a significant impact on the company s financial results of operations and financial position upon adoption 
in may  sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity  was issued 
this statement establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measurers certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
fasb staff position no 
fas  effective date for mandatorily redeemable financial instruments of certain nonpublic entities and certain mandatorily redeemable noncontrolling interests under fasb statement no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity  was issued on november  the fasb staff position deferred the effective date for the classification and measurement provisions for certain mandatorily redeemable noncontrolling interests for an indefinite period 
the other provisions of this statement were effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise were effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  the adoption of sfas no 
for those provisions effective in the current period has not had a significant impact on the company s financial results of operations and financial position 
the adoption of those provisions effective in is not expected to have a significant impact on the company s financial results of operations and financial position 
impact of inflation substantial increases in costs and expenses  particularly food  supplies  labor and operating expenses  could have a significant impact on our operating results to the extent that such increases cannot be passed along to customers 
we do not believe that inflation has materially affected our operating results during the past two years 
a majority of our employees are paid hourly rates related to federal and state minimum wage laws and various laws that allow for credits to that wage 
our cost of operations have been affected by several increases in the federal and state minimum wage in recent years  including a state minimum wage increase in california in january in addition  further increases in the minimum wage are also being discussed by the federal and various state governments 
although we have been able to and will continue to attempt to pass along increases in costs through food and beverage price increases  there can be no assurance that all such increases can be reflected in our prices or that increased prices will be absorbed by customers without diminishing  to some degree  customer spending at its restaurants 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on funded debt 
this exposure relates to its reducing credit line facility 
at december  there are no borrowings under the credit line 
borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at the lender s prime rate 
a hypothetical interest rate change would not have a material impact on our results of operations
