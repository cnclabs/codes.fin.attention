item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report and the information described under the caption risk factors below 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to customer programs and incentives  product returns  bad debts  inventories  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  restructuring  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
inventory our inventories include material  labor and overhead  and are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
as a designer and manufacturer of high technology medical equipment  we may be exposed to a number of economic and industry factors that could result in portions of our inventory becoming either obsolete or in excess of anticipated usage 
these factors include  but are not limited to  technological changes in our markets  our ability to meet changing customer requirements  competitive pressures in products and prices  reliability and replacement of and the availability of key components from our suppliers 
our policy is to establish inventory reserves when conditions exist that suggest that our inventory may be in excess of anticipated demand or is obsolete based upon our assumptions about future demand for our products and market conditions 
we regularly evaluate our ability to realize the value of our inventory based on a combination of factors including the following historical usage rates  forecasted sales or usage  product end of life dates  estimated current and future market values and new product introductions 
assumptions used in determining our estimates of future product demand may prove to be incorrect  in which case the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory would have to be adjusted in the future 
if inventory is determined to be overvalued  we would be required to recognize such costs as cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
although every effort is made to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand could have a significant negative impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
additionally  purchasing requirements and alternative usage avenues are explored within these processes to mitigate inventory exposure 
when recorded  our reserves are intended to reduce the carrying value of our inventory to its net realizable value 

table of contents accounts receivable reserves we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we regularly evaluate the collectibility of our trade receivables based on a combination of factors  which may include dialogue with the customer to determine the cause of non payment  the use of collection agencies  and or the use of litigation 
in the event it is determined that the customer may not be able to meet its full obligation to us  we record a specific allowance to reduce the related receivable to the amount that we expect to recover given all information present 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and our assessment of the customer s current credit worthiness 
we continuously monitor collections from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates in the future 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we also record a provision for estimated sales returns and allowances on product and service related sales in the same period as the related revenues are recorded 
these estimates are based on the specific facts and circumstances of particular orders  analysis of credit memo data and other known factors 
if the data we use to calculate these estimates do not properly reflect reserve requirements  then a change in the allowances would be made in the period in which such a determination is made and revenues in that period could be adversely affected 
our accounts receivable reserves were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the decreases in the reserve in fiscal and was primarily attributable to our write off of reserves and accounts receivable related to financed sales in latin america and a decrease to our bad debt expense in fiscal revenue recognition revenue 
we recognize product revenue upon shipment  provided that there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  there are no uncertainties regarding acceptance  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
generally  our product arrangements are multiple element arrangements  including services such as installation and training 
beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we began accounting for these arrangements in accordance with eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
based on the terms and conditions of the product arrangements  we have concluded that these services can be accounted for separately from the product element as our product has value to our customers on a stand alone basis and we have objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of such services 
accordingly  service revenue representing the fair value of services not yet performed at the time of product shipment is deferred and recognized as such services are performed 
the residual revenue under the product arrangement will be recognized as product revenue upon shipment 
we adopted eitf as a cumulative effective of a change in accounting principle in accordance with apb  accounting changes 
in connection with the adoption of eitf  we reclassified million of product revenue to service revenue for the year ended september  we recognize product revenue upon the completion of installation for shipments that require more than perfunctory obligations at the time of shipment  specifically for certain of our digital imaging systems 
a provision is made at that time for estimated warranty costs to be incurred 
service and other revenues  which primarily includes maintenance contracts  replacement parts  non warranty repair services  installation and training services  and fee per scan revenue are recognized ratably over the contract period for maintenance contracts  at the time of shipment for replacement parts  as the service is rendered for repair  installation and training services and as the fees are collected for fee per scan revenue 
product warranties 
products sold are generally covered by a warranty for a period of one year 
we accrue a warranty reserve at the time of revenue recognition for estimated costs to provide warranty services 
our estimate of costs to service our warranty obligations is based on historical experience and expectation of future conditions 
to the extent we 
table of contents experience increased or decreased warranty claim activity or increased or decreased costs associated with servicing those claims  our warranty accrual will increase or decrease  respectively  resulting in decreased or increased gross profit 
our warranty accrual was approximately million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
this accrual has remained relatively constant over the past three fiscal years 
this is due to a decrease in the warranty accrual attributable to our decision to eliminate the unprofitable conventional general radiography product lines which had warranty periods of up to five years offset by an increase in our warranty accrual for our increase in our digital systems revenues 
income taxes we account for income taxes under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this statement requires that we recognize a current tax liability or asset for current taxes payable or refundable and a deferred tax liability or asset for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences and carryforwards to the extent they are realizable 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
the valuation allowance as of september  and september  primarily relates to net operating losses and research and development tax credits generated in fiscal   and for which we can only realize a benefit through the generation of future taxable income and to certain deferred tax assets in foreign jurisdictions  for which realization is uncertain 
our net deferred tax asset is currently million and we believe it will be fully realized in the next to months 
the american jobs creation act of the act introduced a special one time dividends received deduction on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings to a us taxpayer repatriation provision  provided certain criteria are met 
on october   the act was signed into law by the president 
even in light of the act  we do not provide for us income taxes on earnings of our subsidiaries outside of the us our current intention is to reinvest the total amount of our approximately  of unremitted earnings permanently or to repatriate the earnings only when tax effective to do so 
it is not practical to estimate the amount of additional taxes that might be payable upon repatriation of foreign earnings  however  we believe that previously unbenefitted us operating loss carryovers would largely eliminate any us taxes due upon repatriation 
legal contingencies we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings 
in connection with these legal proceedings  management periodically reviews estimates of potential costs to be incurred by us in connection with the adjudication or settlement  if any  of these proceedings 
these estimates are developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based on an analysis of potential litigation outcomes and settlement strategies 
in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for contingencies  loss contingencies are accrued if  in the opinion of management  an adverse outcome is probable and such outcome can be reasonably estimated 
we do not believe that these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our financial position  however  it is possible that future results for any particular quarter or annual period may be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies relating to these proceedings 
overview we are engaged in the development  manufacture and distribution of proprietary x ray  digital x ray and other medical imaging systems 
our businesses are reported as four segments mammography  osteoporosis assessment  digital detectors  and other 

table of contents our mammography products include a broad product line of breast imaging products  including film based and digital mammography systems and breast biopsy systems 
our osteoporosis assessment products primarily consist of dual energy x ray bone densitometry systems and  to a lesser extent  an ultrasound based osteoporosis assessment product 
bone densitometry is the precise measurement of bone density to assist in the diagnosis and monitoring of osteoporosis and other metabolic bone diseases that can lead to debilitating bone fractures 
our digital detector products are a digital component for original equipment manufacturers to incorporate into their own equipment 
our other business segment includes our mini c arm  conventional general radiography service and digital general radiography systems businesses 
our mini c arm products are low intensity  real time mini c arm x ray systems used primarily for minimally invasive surgery on a patient s extremities 
in january  we closed the manufacturing facility for the conventional general radiography products  however  we continue to service and support most of these product lines 
during fiscal  we phased out our digital general radiography systems and have focused on supplying our digital detectors  reported under our digital detector segment  to other original equipment manufacturers 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of total revenues represented by items as shown in our consolidated statements of operations 
fiscal years ended september  september  september  revenues product sales service and other revenue cost and expenses cost of product sales cost of service and other revenue research and development selling and marketing general and administrative restructuring and relocation income from operations interest income interest other expense income loss before income taxes and cumulative effect of accounting change provision benefit for income taxes income before cumulative effect of accounting change cumulative effect of accounting change net income fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september product sales 
years ended september  september  amount of total revenue amount of total revenue change amount product sales mammography osteoporosis assessment digital detectors other 
table of contents in fiscal our product sales increased compared to fiscal primarily due to the continued growth in the number of our selenia full field digital mammography systems sold and to a lesser extent  our increase in digital detector sales 
partially offsetting these increases was the decrease in sales attributable to our continued phasing out of our general radiography systems business  which is included in our other segment 
we have substantially completed our plan to discontinue taking new orders for general radiography systems as of september   but continue to service the installed base of such equipment 
mammography product sales increased compared to fiscal primarily due to a million increase in worldwide digital mammography system sales and a million increase in multicare stereotactic tables sold in the united states 
the increase in our digital mammography product sales was primarily attributable to an increase in the number of selenia systems sold and  to a lesser extent  a modest increase in the average selling price for those systems 
in fiscal we sold digital mammography systems compared to systems in fiscal the increase in the average selling price of the selenia contributed million to our digital mammography product sales during fiscal we attribute the increase in digital mammography system sales primarily to the growing acceptance of our selenia mammography system and of digital mammography in general 
the increase in sales of our multicare stereotactic tables  in the united states  was primarily attributable to an increase in the number of tables sold in the first two quarters of fiscal as compared to the corresponding quarters of the prior year 
the increases in digital mammography and table sales were partially offset by a million decrease in analog mammography systems sales in the united states  primarily as a result of reduced unit sales of those systems related to the increased market acceptance of digital mammography 
osteoporosis assessment product sales decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal this decrease was primarily attributable to a million decrease in sales of our dual energy x ray bone densitometry systems in the united states and a decrease of  due to a reduction in the number of sahara ultrasound systems sold in the united states 
the decrease in united states sales of dual energy x ray bone densitometry systems was primarily attributable to a decrease in the number of systems sold and a shift to our lower priced systems sold into the primary care market 
these reductions were partially offset by a million increase in sales in international markets  primarily attributable to an increase in the number of our lower priced explorer systems sold  and a  increase in upgrade sales 
digital detector product sales increased in fiscal compared to fiscal this increase was primarily due to an increase in the number of digital detectors sold in the united states and europe  partially offset by a decrease in the number of detectors sold in asia 
product sales of digital detectors in the current year increased million in the united states  million in europe and decreased million in asia compared to fiscal the increase in the united states primarily reflects the increase in the number of digital detectors sold for general radiography systems  while the increase for europe primarily reflects the increase in the number of digital detectors sold for mammography systems 
the decrease in asia is primarily due to a reduction in the number of digital general radiography detectors sold 
we believe that our increase in digital detector sales reflects the growing acceptance of digital radiography and our technology  as well as our decision to phase out our digital general radiography systems and to focus on supplying our digital detectors to other original equipment manufacturers 
other product sales decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal this decrease was primarily attributable to a million decrease in worldwide digital general radiography product sales and a million decrease in our mini c arm product sales  primarily in the united states 
the decrease in general radiography product sales reflects our decision to phase out our digital general radiography systems 
as a result of this decision  we expect product sales for our digital general radiography systems to be negligible next year 
in the current year  sales of digital general radiography systems accounted for million of other product revenues 
we attribute the decrease in sales of our mini c arm products primarily to a reduction in the number of systems sold as a result of increased competition and competitive pricing pressure 

table of contents in fiscal  approximately of product sales were generated in the united states  in europe  in asia  in latin america and in other international markets 
in fiscal  approximately of product sales were generated in the united states  in europe  in asia  in latin america and in other international markets 
we believe the shift in sales to europe and other international markets is primarily due to the timing of an increase in demand from those territories 
the increase in sales in latin america during the current year was primarily attributable to a large sale of our selenia digital mammography systems in mexico in the first six months of fiscal in the second half of fiscal our product sales to latin america constituted approximately of our total product sales 
service and other revenue 
years ended september  september  amount of total revenue amount of total revenue change amount service and other revenue service and other revenue is primarily comprised of revenue generated from our field service organization to provide ongoing service  installation and repair of our products 
service and other revenue increased in fiscal compared to the prior year 
the increase in service and other revenue in fiscal was primarily due to a million increase in service contract revenues in our mammography segment compared to fiscal  primarily as a result of our assuming service responsibilities previously performed by a former distributor and the continued growth in our installed base of mammography systems and digital detectors 
the increase in mammography service revenue was partially offset by a million decrease in osteoporosis assessment service revenues 
we attribute this decrease primarily to the completion of a multi year service contract in europe during fiscal that has not been renewed 
cost of product sales 
years ended september  september  amount of product sales amount of product sales change amount cost of product sales the cost of product sales decreased as a percentage of product sales to in fiscal from in fiscal cost of product sales decreased as a percentage of product sales primarily due to increased revenues and improved gross margins recognized on the shift in mammography product sales to selenia  our full field digital mammography systems 
these systems have significantly higher selling prices  more than offsetting the higher costs of the product  when compared to analog mammography 
this improvement was partially offset by reduced margins associated with our sales of osteoporosis assessment and mini c arm products  discussed in further detail under our segment results of operations below 

table of contents cost of service and other revenue 
years ended september  september  amount of service revenue amount of service revenue change amount cost of service and other revenue cost of service and other revenue increased both in percentage of service revenue and absolute dollars  primarily related to additional personnel and other costs to expand our service capabilities  especially in the united states  as we continue to assume direct coverage of territories previously assigned to distributors and to support our growing installed base of products and due to increased warranty costs in our digital detector business 
we expect our costs of service and other revenue to remain relatively high as a percentage of service and other revenue  reflecting our need to employ the required personnel for warranty  non warranty and installation activities to service our growing installed base of products 
we also expect an increase in customers entering into service agreements in connection with our transition to digital mammography and direct service coverage 
operating expenses 
years ended september  september  amount of total revenue amount of total revenue change amount operating expenses research and development selling and marketing general and administrative research and development expenses 
research and development expenses decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to a decrease in research and development spending and personnel costs primarily related to our phase out of the digital general radiography systems product line announced in the fourth quarter of fiscal these decreases were offset in part from an increase in mammography related research and development expenses including our tomosynthesis development project 
we expect total research and development expenses to continue to increase as we accelerate our development efforts of tomosynthesis technology for mammography in fiscal selling and marketing expenses 
selling and marketing expenses increased in fiscal compared to fiscal these expenses decreased as a percentage of revenue to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase in the current fiscal year was primarily due to an increase of approximately  of international distributor commissions primarily related to the sale of selenias in mexico in the first six months of fiscal   of increased commissions to our direct sales force due to the increased product sales in direct territories and  of tradeshow expenses related to the promotion of our full field digital mammography system  selenia 
sales and marketing expenses have also shifted between the operating segments for the current fiscal year by increasing in mammography  reflecting our increased revenues from that segment  and decreasing for our digital general radiography systems which are being phased out 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal compared to fiscal as a percentage of revenue these expenses decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase in the dollar amount of these expenses was primarily due to an increase of approximately million in bonus and profit sharing expense in accordance with the applicable plans as a result of continued improved financial results 
in addition  we incurred  of due diligence expenses in the third quarter of fiscal in connection with a potential acquisition 
prior to the end of the third quarter we decided not to pursue this potential acquisition further and accordingly expensed all 
table of contents acquisition costs in that quarter 
partially offsetting these increases were a  decrease in the bad debt provision as a result of strong cash collections in fiscal  a  decrease of legal fees and a  decrease in the fees associated with our note payable to wells fargo foothill  inc due to an amendment executed in july interest income 
years ended september  september  amount amount change amount interest income interest income decreased in fiscal compared to the prior year primarily due to a decrease in the interest rate earned in fiscal compared to last year  partially offset by higher investment balances 
interest other expense 
years ended september  september  amount amount change amount interest other expense interest and other expense primarily consist of interest costs on the wells fargo foothill  inc note payable 
the decrease in these expenses was primarily due to the amendment made to the wells fargo foothill  inc note payable in the third quarter of fiscal that significantly reduced the costs related to this facility 
other expense also includes foreign currency transaction gains and losses and interest costs on a bank line of credit used by our european subsidiaries to borrow funds in their local currencies to pay for intercompany sales  thereby reducing the foreign currency exposure in these transactions 
in fiscal and we did not recognize any significant foreign exchange gains or losses or incur any interest charges under our foreign currency line of credit 
to the extent that foreign currency exchange rates fluctuate in the future  we may be exposed to continued financial risk 
although we have established a borrowing line of credit denominated in the foreign currency  the euro  in which our subsidiaries currently conduct business to minimize this risk  we cannot assure that we will be successful or can fully hedge our outstanding exposure

likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
we have provided for nominal federal  state and foreign income taxes in fiscal and and certain minimum taxes where net operating losses cannot be used 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
years ended september  september  amount amount change amount cumulative effect of change in accounting principle during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we adopted eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in accordance with apb  accounting changes  in fiscal in connection with the adoption of eitf  we recorded a cumulative effect adjustment of  in the first quarter of fiscal segment results of operations as a result of our decision to phase out our digital general radiography systems and to focus on supplying our digital detectors to other original equipment manufacturers  as well as the trends in the markets in which we compete  we revised our segment reporting in the first quarter of fiscal our businesses are reported as four segments mammography  osteoporosis assessment  digital detectors and other 
prior periods have been restated to conform to this presentation 
the accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the footnotes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we measure segment performance based on total revenues and operating income or loss 
revenues from product sales of each of these segments are described in further detail above 
the discussion that follows is a summary analysis of total revenues and the primary changes in operating income or loss by segment 
mammography 
years ended september  september  amount of total segment revenue amount of total segment revenue change amount total revenues operating income mammography revenues increased primarily due to the million increase in product sales and an increase of million in service revenues related to the increased number of systems in our installed base discussed above 
operating income for this business segment increased primarily due to the increased revenues and the improved gross margin from the 
table of contents shift in product revenues to our more profitable selenia full field digital mammography systems from our analog mammography systems 
our gross margin in this business segment was in fiscal compared to in the prior year 
partially offsetting this increase was additional international commissions  totaling million  related to a multiple unit selenia sale in mexico in the first six months of fiscal and an increased allocation of operating expenses previously absorbed by the digital general radiography business 
osteoporosis assessment 
years ended september  september  amount of total segment revenue amount of total segment revenue change amount total revenues operating income osteoporosis assessment revenues decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to a million decrease in service revenues and the  decrease in product sales discussed above 
the decrease in service revenues was primarily due to the completion of a multi year service contract in europe during fiscal that was not renewed 
operating income for osteoporosis assessment decreased primarily due to decreased revenues and gross margins 
our gross margin in this business segment was in fiscal compared to in fiscal the decrease in osteoporosis assessment gross margins was primarily attributable to the decrease in revenues  a shift to international sales where we generally sell at lower prices through distributors  a shift to lower priced systems sold into the united states primary care market and an increased allocation of operating expenses previously absorbed by the digital general radiography systems business  which is being phased out 
partially offsetting these decreases in operating income was reduced commissions expense  primarily related to the shift to international sales 
digital detectors 
years ended september  september  amount of total segment revenue amount of total segment revenue change amount total revenues operating loss digital detector revenues increased primarily due to the increased number of digital detectors sold as discussed above and a million increase in service revenues 
the service revenues increase is due to the increase in the number of detectors in the installed base 
the decrease in the digital detector business operating loss is primarily due to the increased revenues and the improved gross profit from that increase  and a decrease in our operating expenses 
our gross margin in this business segment decreased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal the decrease in gross margin was primarily due to increased warranty and service expenses 
the decrease in operating expenses was primarily attributable to a lower allocation of sales and marketing expenses and a decrease in research and development spending related to the completion of our digital detector development for selenia 

table of contents other 
years ended september  september  amount of total segment revenue amount of total segment revenue change amount total revenues operating income loss revenues for this business segment  which includes the mini c arm business  the digital general radiography business and the conventional general radiography service business  decreased primarily due to a million decrease in digital general radiography systems sold worldwide  as a result of our phase out of that business  and a million decrease in product sales of our mini c arm products primarily in the united states as discussed above 
the improvements in operating income were primarily due to lower operating expenses as a result of our decision to de emphasize the digital general radiography systems business  which has been substantially phased out  and to reallocate resources and costs in order to focus on the more profitable and faster growing digital mammography systems 
these improvements were partially offset by the reduced revenue and gross profits from the decrease in mini c arm system sales 
fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september product sales 
years ended september  september  amount of total revenue amount of total revenue change amount product sales mammography osteoporosis assessment digital detectors other in fiscal our product sales increased compared to fiscal primarily due to increased mammography and osteoporosis assessment product sales 
partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in our conventional general radiography product revenues due to our phase out of this unprofitable product line during fiscal  and slightly lower mini c arm sales 
mammography product sales increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to a million increase in digital mammography system sales primarily attributable to an increase in the number of selenia full field digital mammography systems sold worldwide 
in addition  there was a million increase attributable to an increase in the number of multicare stereotactic tables sold 
these increases were partially offset by an million decrease in analog 
table of contents mammography systems sales primarily in the united states 
the decrease in analog system sales in the united states was primarily attributable to a decrease in the number of systems sold  which we attribute primarily to a decrease in the market for analog systems as a result of the growing acceptance of digital technology 
osteoporosis assessment product sales increased in fiscal compared to fiscal this increase was primarily due to an increase in the number of systems sold internationally and  to a lesser extent  to the initial shipments of our new discovery line of bone densitometers at higher average selling prices 
digital detector product sales increased in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase was primarily due to an increase in the average selling prices of digital detectors resulting in higher revenues on fewer units sold 
other product sales decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal this decrease was primarily attributable to a million decrease in worldwide conventional general radiography product sales due to our decision to phase out our unprofitable conventional general radiography product line  which was completed in fiscal in fiscal  approximately of product sales were generated in the united states  in europe  in asia  in latin america and in other international markets

service and other revenue 
years ended september  september  amount of total revenue amount of total revenue change amount service and other revenue service and other revenue is primarily comprised of revenue generated from our field service organization to provide ongoing service  installation and repair of our products 
service and other revenue increased in fiscal compared to fiscal this increase was primarily due to increased service revenues primarily in our mammography business as a result of our assuming service responsibilities previously performed by a former distributor and increased service contract revenues in our osteoporosis assessment and digital imaging businesses 
partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in other revenue from the licensing of certain mammography patented technology and additional fee per scan revenues as compared to fiscal in the second quarter of fiscal  we terminated an independent dealer who represented almost one half of the us market for our mammography products in fiscal and assumed full sales and service responsibility in these geographic locations on a direct basis 
to provide the necessary sales coverage and service support we hired sales and service personnel 
cost of product sales 
years ended september  september  amount of product sales amount of product sales change amount cost of product sales 
table of contents cost of product sales decreased as a percentage of product sales to in fiscal from in fiscal these costs decreased as a percentage of product sales primarily due to improved gross margins recognized on the mammography and osteoporosis assessment products as a result of the increase in revenues  as well as lower manufacturing costs on the mini c arm products and the elimination of our unprofitable conventional general radiography product line in the third quarter of fiscal the increased volume has improved the absorption of manufacturing overhead at our manufacturing facilities for those products 
our drc subsidiary continues to have significant fixed manufacturing costs and is operating significantly below manufacturing capacity 
cost of service and other revenue 
years ended september  september  amount of service revenue amount of service revenue change amount cost of service and other revenue cost of service and other revenue increased as a percentage of service and other revenue to in fiscal from in fiscal these costs increased as a percentage of service and other revenue primarily due to additional personnel and other costs in our field service area to expand our united states service capabilities for our digital mammography and general radiography systems and to assume direct coverage of territories previously assigned to distributors  as well as to lower levels of other revenue 
operating expenses 
years ended september  september  amount of total revenue amount of total revenue change amount operating expenses research and development selling and marketing general and administrative restructuring and relocation research and development expenses 
research and development expenses decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in research and development spending and personnel primarily related to reduced spending of million on digital detectors at drc  a decrease of  due to our phase out of the conventional general radiography product line in fiscal and a decrease of  related to our mammography business 
these decreases were partially offset by increased spending of million related to our general radiography digital imaging systems 
approximately million and million of the total of these expenses related to the development of digital mammography and digital general radiography systems and detectors at drc in fiscal and  respectively 

table of contents selling and marketing expenses 
selling and marketing expenses increased in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase was primarily due to additional personnel and other costs incurred to expand our united states coverage of territories previously assigned to distributors  and to a lesser extent  higher trade show expenses in fiscal compared to general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase was primarily due to additional personnel  increased employee benefit expenses and expenses related to the implementation of our integrated enterprise wide software application 
restructuring and relocation costs 
restructuring and relocation costs in the first and second quarters of fiscal were primarily the result of our continuing efforts to streamline operations and eliminate unprofitable product lines 
in the second quarter of fiscal  we incurred severance costs of approximately  in connection with the reduction of our workforce in the united states and europe by persons across all functional areas 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we incurred a restructuring charge of approximately  primarily comprised of severance costs related to the termination of employees at the littleton facility 
in addition  we incurred severance cost of approximately  and  in connection with the closure of our direct sales and service office in paris  france and the continued reduction of lorad s workforce  respectively 
the severance charges related to the workforce reductions of persons in france and persons at lorad and were across all functional areas 
interest income

interest other expense 
years ended september  september  amount amount change amount interest other expense 
table of contents in fiscal  these expenses were primarily due to the interest costs on the wells fargo foothill  inc note payable 
in fiscal  these expenses included interest costs of approximately million on the million note payable issued in connection with the trex medical acquisition and to a much lesser extent  interest costs on the wells fargo foothill  inc note payable  foreign currency transaction losses and interest costs on a bank line of credit used by our european subsidiaries to borrow funds in their local currencies to pay for intercompany sales  thereby reducing the foreign currency exposure on those transactions 
in september  we paid off the note payable to trex medical with the proceeds from the sale leaseback transaction of two of our facilities 
to the extent that foreign currency exchange rates fluctuate in the future  we may be exposed to continued financial risk 
although we have established a borrowing line of credit denominated in the foreign currency  the euro  in which our subsidiaries currently conduct business to minimize this risk  we cannot assure that we will be successful or can fully hedge our outstanding exposure 
provision benefit for income taxes 
years ended september  september  amount amount change amount provision benefit for income taxes we provided for certain minimum taxes where net operating losses cannot be used in fiscal in fiscal we had a benefit for income taxes of  as a result of a million tax benefit recorded in the second quarter of fiscal  partially offset by a million tax provision recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal to reduce our deferred tax asset to million that we believe will be fully realizable in the next to months 
during fiscal  as a result of the economic stimulus bill signed into law in march  we filed carry back claims of approximately million 
of this amount  we received million in cash in fiscal and million  which we received in fiscal  is included in other current assets in the accompanying balance sheet at september  liquidity and capital resources at september  we had approximately million of working capital 
at that date our cash and cash equivalents totaled million 
our cash and cash equivalents balance increased million during fiscal primarily due to cash provided by operating and financing activities partially offset by the use of cash for purchases of property and equipment 
our cash provided by operating activities was million  which included net income of million for fiscal increased by non cash charges for depreciation and amortization of an aggregate of million 
cash provided by operations due to changes in our current assets and liabilities included an increase in deferred revenue of million  an increase in accrued expenses of million and a decrease in inventory of million 
these sources of cash were partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of million 
the increase in deferred revenue was primarily due to an increase in the number of deferred service contracts and an increase in customer deposits 
the increase in accrued expenses was primarily due to timing of payments 
the decrease in inventory was primarily the result of improved supply chain management 
the increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to the increased revenues during fiscal in fiscal  we used approximately million of cash in investing activities 
this use of cash was primarily attributable to purchases of property and equipment of million  which consisted primarily of computer hardware  demonstration and manufacturing equipment 

table of contents in fiscal  financing activities provided us with million of cash 
these cash flows included approximately million from the exercise of stock options partially offset by repayments  totaling million  of our term loan with wells fargo foothill  inc and our fleet business credit  llc note payable 
as of september  we had short term borrowings  including the current portion of our long term obligations  of  and long term notes payable totaling  these amounts represent our obligations of our term loan under our credit facility with wells fargo foothill  inc we maintain an unsecured line of credit with a european bank for the equivalent of million  which bears interest at the europe interbank offered rate at september  plus 
the borrowings under this line are primarily used by our european subsidiaries to settle intercompany sales and are denominated in the respective local currencies of its european subsidiaries 
the line of credit may be canceled by the bank with days notice 
at september   there were no outstanding borrowings under this line 
in september we obtained a secured loan from wells fargo foothill  inc the loan agreement with wells fargo foothill  inc provides for a term loan of approximately million  which we borrowed at signing  and a revolving line of credit facility 
the maximum amount we can borrow under the loan agreement and amendment is million 
the loan agreement and amendment contain financial and other covenants and the actual amount which we can borrow under the line of credit at any time is based upon a formula tied to the amount of our qualifying accounts receivable 
at september   the total amount of availability under this formula was million 
in july we amended this loan agreement primarily to simplify financial covenants and to reduce the fees related to this facility 
the term loan accrues interest at prime plus for five years 
the line of credit advances accrue interest at prime plus 
the line of credit expires in september we were in compliance with all covenants as of september  at september   there were no outstanding borrowings under our line of credit 
in september  we completed a sale leaseback transaction for our headquarters and manufacturing facility located in bedford  massachusetts and our lorad manufacturing facility in danbury  connecticut 
the transaction resulted in net proceeds to us of million 
the lease for these facilities  including the associated land  has a term of years  with four five year year renewal terms  which we may exercise at our option 
the basic rent for the facilities is million per year  which is subject to adjustment for increases in the consumer price index 
the aggregate total minimum lease payments during the initial year term are million 
in addition  we are required to maintain the facilities during the term of the lease and to pay all taxes  insurance  utilities and other costs associated with those facilities 
under the lease  we make customary representations and warranties and agree to certain financial covenants and indemnities 
in the event we default on the lease  the landlord may terminate the lease  accelerate payments and collect liquidated damages 
we were in compliance with all covenants as of september  the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of september  payments due by period in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt operating leases purchase obligations total contractual obligations 
table of contents except as set forth above  we do not have any other significant capital commitments 
we are working on several projects  with an emphasis on digital mammography 
subject to the risk factors set forth below and the general disclaimers set forth in our special note regarding forward looking statements at the outset of this report  we believe that we have sufficient funds in order to fund our expected operations over the next twelve months 
the expected timing of payment and amounts of the obligations discussed above are estimated based on current information 
recent accounting pronouncements in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb concluded that proposed statement r  share based payment  which would require all companies to measure compensation cost for all share based payments  including employee stock options  at fair value  would be effective for public companies except small business issuers as defined in sec regulation s b for interim or annual periods beginning after june  the fasb has tentatively concluded that companies could adopt the new standard using either the modified prospective transition method or the modified retrospective transition method 
under the modified prospective transition method  a company would recognize share based employee compensation cost from the beginning of the fiscal period in which the recognition provisions are first applied as if the fair value based accounting method had been used to account for all employee awards granted  modified  or settled after the effective date and to any awards that were not fully vested as of the effective date 
measurement and attribution of compensation cost for awards that are not vested as of the effective date of the proposed statement would be based on the same estimate of the grant date fair value and the same attribution method used previously under statement either for recognition or pro forma purposes 
under the modified retrospective transition method  a company would recognize employee compensation cost for periods presented prior to the adoption of statement r in accordance with the original provisions of statement  that is  an entity would recognize employee compensation cost in the amounts reported in the pro forma disclosures provided in accordance with statement a company would not be permitted to make any changes to those amounts upon adoption of the proposed statement unless those changes represent a correction of an error and are disclosed accordingly 
for periods after the date of adoption of statement r  the modified prospective transition method described above would be applied 
the company is in the process of determining the impact of this statement on its consolidated financial statements 
risk factors this report contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  such as statements of our objectives  expectations and intentions 
the cautionary statements made in this report should be read as applicable to all forward looking statements wherever they appear in this report 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed herein 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed below  as well as those discussed elsewhere in this report 

table of contents the markets for our direct radiography products are in the early stage of development 
in  our subsidiary  direct radiography corp  was the first company to introduce direct to digital x ray imaging products in the united states 
the markets for these products are relatively new 
there is a significant installed base of conventional x ray imaging products in hospitals and radiological practices 
the use of our direct to digital x ray imaging products  including digital mammography products  in many cases would require these potential customers to either modify or replace their existing x ray imaging equipment 
moreover  we believe that a major factor in the market s acceptance of direct to digital x ray technology is the trend toward transition by the healthcare industry from conventional film archiving systems to hospital picture archiving and communications systems  known as pacs  to store x ray images electronically 
because the benefits of our direct to digital technology may not be fully realized by customers until they install a pacs platform  a large potential market for these products may not develop until pacs environments are more widely used 
because of the early stage of the markets for these products  it is likely that our evaluation of the potential markets for these products will materially vary with time 
we cannot assure that the markets for our direct radiography products will continue to develop 
if we fail to achieve and maintain the high manufacturing standards that our direct radiography products require  we will not be successful in developing and marketing those products 
the manufacture of our direct radiography detectors is highly complex and requires precise high quality manufacturing that is difficult to achieve 
we have in the past and may in the future experience difficulties in manufacturing these detectors in commercial quantities  primarily related to delays and difficulties in obtaining critical components for these detectors that meet our high manufacturing standards 
our initial difficulties have led to increased delivery lead times and increased costs of manufacturing these products 
our failure  including the failure of our contract manufacturers  to achieve and maintain the required high manufacturing standards could result in further delays or failures in product testing or delivery  cost overruns  product recalls or withdrawals  or other problems that could harm our business and prospects 
we continue to incur significant losses in our digital detector business segment and cannot assure that the segment will become profitable 
our digital detector business segment incurred net losses of million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal at the beginning of fiscal we started to move away from selling our own general digital x ray systems in competition with our oem partners in general digital radiography  and to focus on selling our directray detectors to oem s for incorporation in their own line of digital radiography systems 
notwithstanding this shift in focus  we cannot assure that the operating results of our digital detector segment will improve 
our success depends on new product development 
we have a continuing research and development program designed to develop new products and to enhance and improve our products 
we are expending significant resources on the development of digital x ray imaging products  including a digital mammography product 
the successful development of our products and product enhancements are subject to numerous risks  both known and unknown  including unanticipated delays  access to capital  budget overruns  technical problems  and other difficulties that could result in the abandonment or substantial change in the design  development and commercialization of these new products  including  for example  changes requested by the fda in connection with pre market approval applications for our products or k notification 

table of contents given the uncertainties inherent with product development and introduction  we cannot assure that any of our product development efforts will be successful on a timely basis or within budget  if at all 
our failure to develop new products and product enhancements on a timely basis or within budget could harm our business and prospects 
our business could be harmed if our products contain undetected errors or defects or do not meet customer specifications 
we are continuously developing new products and improving our existing products 
newly introduced products can contain undetected errors or defects 
in addition  these products may not meet their performance specifications under all conditions or for all applications 
if  despite our internal testing and testing by our customers  any of our products contains errors or defects or any of our products fails to meet customer specifications  then we may be required to enhance or improve those products or technologies 
we may not be able to do so on a timely basis  if at all  and may only be able to do so at considerable expense 
in addition  any significant reliability problems could result in adverse customer reaction  negative publicity or legal claims and could harm our business and prospects 
our reliance on one or only a limited number of suppliers for some key components or subassemblies for our products could harm our business and prospects 
we rely on one or only a limited number of suppliers for some key components or subassemblies for our products 
in particular we have a limited number of suppliers for each of the panel and the coating of that panel for our direct radiography products 
in addition  we have only limited sources of supply for some key components used in our mini c arm systems 
obtaining alternative sources of supply of these components could involve significant delays and other costs  and may not be available to us on reasonable terms  if at all 
the failure of a component supplier or contract assembler to provide acceptable quality and timely components or assembly service at an acceptable price  or an interruption of supplies from such a supplier could harm our business and prospects 
any disruption of supplies of key components could delay or reduce shipments  which could result in lost or deferred sales 
we have recently expanded our direct sales and service efforts of our products into territories that were previously covered by independent distributors  are considering further expanding our direct sales and service coverage in the united states  and cannot assure that we can effect any such transition effectively 
sales of our products may fluctuate if our sales force is unable to successfully market and sell a broader product offering 
we have sold and serviced a majority of our mammography systems in the united states primarily through a network of independent distributors and to a lesser extent  through our direct sales force 
during fiscal  we expanded our direct sales and service efforts for mammography into territories that were previously covered by independent distributors  and are considering further expanding our direct sales and service coverage in the united states 
we have also expanded the product offerings sold by our direct sales force to include our entire product line 
the transition to a direct sales and service force with a more diversified product offering could adversely affect our relationships with our end user customers and sales of our products  if we are unable to manage the transition effectively or our direct sales force is otherwise unable to successfully market and sell a broader product offering 
if we are unable to satisfy our financial covenants under our long term leases for our headquarters and lorad facilities  the rent due under those leases may be accelerated and we could be required to pay liquidated damages 
our long term leases contain financial and other covenants 
if we do not comply with our covenants under our long term leases  the remaining rent payable under those leases could be accelerated and we could be required to pay liquidated damages 
our failure to meet any of our covenants under our long term leases could significantly harm our liquidity and financial position 

table of contents we may not be able to compete successfully 
a number of companies have developed  or are expected to develop  products that compete or will compete with our products 
many of these competitors offer a range of products in areas other than those in which we compete  which may make such competitors more attractive to hospitals  radiology clients  general purchasing organizations and other potential customers 
in addition  many of our competitors and potential competitors are larger and have greater financial resources than we do and offer a range of products broader than our products 
some of the companies with which we now compete or may compete in the future have or may have more extensive research  marketing and manufacturing capabilities and significantly greater technical and personnel resources than we do  and may be better positioned to continue to improve their technology in order to compete in an evolving industry 
our failure to compete successfully could harm our business and prospects 
the primary competitor for our osteoporosis assessment products is general electric medical systems ge 
our direct to digital imaging products compete with traditional x ray systems as well as indirect conversion systems  such as computed radiography systems  which are less expensive than our products  and other direct to digital systems 
the larger competitors in these markets include ge  siemens  kodak  canon  philips  swissray  fischer imaging and varian 
at the beginning of fiscal  we started to move away from selling our own general digital x ray systems in competition with our oem partners in general digital radiography and focus more on expanding our oem sales for our directray panel 
our mammography systems compete with products offered by ge  siemens  planmed  fischer imaging and agfa 
our minimally invasive breast biopsy systems compete with products offered by fischer imaging and with conventional surgical biopsy procedures 
our mini c arm products compete directly with mini c arms manufactured and sold by a limited number of companies including ge 
we also compete indirectly with manufacturers of conventional c arm image intensifiers including philips  siemens and ge 
our success depends upon our ability to adapt to rapid changes in technology and customer requirements 
the market for our products has been characterized by rapid technological change  frequent product introductions and evolving customer requirements 
we believe that these trends will continue into the foreseeable future 
our success will depend  in part  upon our ability to enhance our existing products  successfully develop new products that meet increasing customer requirements and gain market acceptance 
if we fail to do so our products may be rendered obsolete or uncompetitive by new industry standards or changing technology 
our business may be harmed by acquisitions we may complete in the future 
we may pursue acquisitions of related businesses  technologies  product lines  and products 
our identification of suitable acquisition candidates involves risks inherent in assessing the values  strengths  weaknesses  risks and profitability of acquisition candidates  including the effects of the possible acquisition on our business  diversion of our management s attention and risks associated with unanticipated problems or latent liabilities 
in fiscal  we incurred approximately  of professional fees  which we expensed  in connection with the analysis and negotiation of a potential acquisition that we decided not to complete 
if we are successful in pursuing future acquisitions  we will be required to expend significant funds  incur additional debt or issue additional securities  which may negatively affect our results of operations and be dilutive to our stockholders 
if we spend significant funds or incur additional debt  our ability to obtain financing for working capital or other purposes could decline  and we may be more vulnerable to economic downturns and competitive pressures 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to finance additional acquisitions or that we will realize any anticipated benefits from acquisitions that we complete 
should we acquire another business  the process of integrating acquired operations into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may require significant financial resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of our existing business 
our failure to manage current or future alliances or joint ventures effectively may harm our business and prospects 
we have entered into strategic alliances with agfa  siemens  r technologies and icad 
we are also exploring other potential alliances  joint ventures or other business relationships 
agfa and siemens compete with us in some of our business segments  and are competitors or potential competitors to some of our customers or potential customers 
our alliance with 
table of contents agfa  siemens or any other person could enhance their business to our detriment or make it more difficult for us to enter into advantageous business transactions or relationships with others 
moreover  we may not be able to identify appropriate candidates for alliances or joint ventures  assure that any alliance or joint venture candidate will provide us with the support anticipated  successfully negotiate an alliance or joint venture on terms that are advantageous to us  or successfully manage any alliance or joint venture 
furthermore  any alliance or joint venture may divert management time and resources 
our entering into a disadvantageous alliance or joint venture or failure to manage an alliance or joint venture effectively could harm our business and prospects 
the uncertainty of healthcare reform could harm our business and prospects 
in recent years  the healthcare industry has undergone significant change driven by various efforts to reduce costs  including efforts at national healthcare reform  trends toward managed care  cuts in medicare  consolidation of healthcare distribution companies and collective purchasing arrangements by office based healthcare practitioners 
healthcare reform proposals and medical cost containment measures in the united states and in many foreign countries could limit the use of our products  reduce reimbursement available for such use  or adversely affect the use of new therapies for which our products may be targeted 
these reforms or cost containment measures  including the uncertainty in the medical community regarding their nature and effect  could harm our business and prospects and make it difficult for us to raise additional capital on advantageous terms  if at all 
we depend on third party reimbursement to our customers for market acceptance of our products 
failure of third party payors to provide appropriate levels of reimbursement for use of our products could harm our business and prospects 
sales of medical products largely depend on the reimbursement of patients medical expenses by government healthcare programs and private health insurers 
the costs of our products are substantial  and market acceptance of our products depends upon our customers ability to obtain appropriate levels of reimbursement from third party payors for use of our products 
in the united states  the centers for medicare medicaid services  known as cms  establishes guidelines for the reimbursement of healthcare providers treating medicare and medicaid patients 
under current cms guidelines  varying reimbursement levels have been established for bone density assessment  mammography and other imaging and diagnostic procedures performed by our products 
the actual reimbursement amounts are determined by individual state medicare carriers and  for non medicare and medicaid patients  private insurance carriers 
there are often delays between the reimbursement approvals by cms and by a state medicare carrier and private insurance carriers 
moreover  states as well as private insurance carriers may choose not to follow the cms reimbursement guidelines 
the use of our products outside the united states is similarly affected by reimbursement policies adopted by foreign regulatory and insurance carriers 
a reduction or other adverse change in reimbursement policies for the use of our products could harm our business and prospects 

table of contents the future growth of our bone densitometry business depends in large part on the continued development and more widespread acceptance of complementary therapies as well as our ability to expand into the primary care market 
our bone densitometers and related products are used to assist physicians in diagnosing patients at risk for osteoporosis and other bone disorders  and to monitor the effectiveness of therapies to treat these disorders 
as a result  the future growth of the market for these products and of this business will in large part be dependent upon the development and more widespread acceptance of drug therapies to prevent and to treat osteoporosis  and in addition  our ability to expand into the primary care market 
over the last several years  the fda has approved a number of drug therapies to treat osteoporosis 
we also understand that a number of other drug therapies are under development 
while sales of our bone densitometry products have benefited from the increased availability and use of these therapies  most patients who are at risk for osteoporosis continue to go untreated 
we cannot assure that any therapies under development or in clinical trials will prove to be effective  obtain regulatory approval  or that any approved therapy will gain wide spread acceptance  or that we will be able to expand into the primary care market 
even if these therapies gain widespread acceptance  we cannot assure that this acceptance will increase the sales of our products 
reductions in revenues could harm our operating results because a high percentage of our operating expenses is relatively fixed 
a high percentage of our operating expenses is relatively fixed 
we likely will not be able to reduce spending to compensate for adverse fluctuations in revenues 
as a result  shortfalls in revenues are likely to harm our operating results 
our results of operations are subject to significant quarterly variation and seasonal fluctuation 
our results of operations have been and may continue to be subject to significant quarterly variation 
the results for a particular quarter may vary due to a number of factors  including the overall state of healthcare and cost containment efforts  the development status and demand for drug therapies to treat osteoporosis  the development status and demand for our direct to digital imaging products  economic conditions in our markets  foreign exchange rates  the timing of orders  the timing of expenditures in anticipation of future sales  the mix of products sold by us  the introduction of new products and product enhancements by us or our competitors  and pricing and other competitive conditions 
customers may also cancel or reschedule shipments 
production difficulties could also delay shipments 
any of these factors also could harm our business and prospects 
our delay or inability to obtain any necessary united states or foreign regulatory clearances or approvals for our products could harm our business and prospects 
our products are medical devices that are the subject of a high level of regulatory oversight 
our delay or inability to obtain any necessary united states or foreign regulatory clearances or approvals for our products could harm our business and prospects 
the process of obtaining clearances and approvals can be costly and time consuming 
there is a risk that any approvals or clearances  once obtained  may be withdrawn or modified 
medical devices cannot be marketed in the united 
table of contents states without clearance or approval by the fda 
medical devices sold in the united states must also be manufactured in compliance with fda good manufacturing practices  which regulate the design  manufacture  packing  storage and installation of medical devices 
moreover  medical devices are required to comply with fda regulations relating to investigational research and labeling 
states may also regulate the manufacture  sale and use of medical devices  particularly those that employ x ray technology 
our products are also subject to approval and regulation by foreign regulatory and safety agencies 
fluctuations in the exchange rates of european currencies and the other foreign currencies in which we conduct our business  in relation to the us dollar  have harmed and could continue to harm our business and prospects 
foreign sales accounted for approximately of our product sales in fiscal  of product sales in fiscal and of our product sales in fiscal we maintain a sales and service office in belgium and a support office in france 
the expenses and sales of these offices are denominated in local currencies 
we anticipate that foreign sales and sales denominated in foreign currencies will continue to account for a significant portion of our total sales 
fluctuations in the value of local currencies have caused  and are likely to continue to cause  amounts translated into us dollars to fluctuate in comparison with previous periods 
we have hedged our foreign currency exposure by borrowing funds in local european currencies to pay the expenses of our foreign offices 
there is a risk that these hedging activities will not be successful in mitigating our foreign exchange risk exposure 
we conduct our business worldwide  which exposes us to a number of difficulties in coordinating our international activities and dealing with multiple regulatory environments 
we sell our products to customers throughout the world 
our worldwide business may be harmed by difficulties in staffing and managing operations in multiple locations  greater difficulties in trade accounts receivable collection  possible adverse tax consequences  governmental currency controls  changes in various regulatory requirements  political and economic changes and disruptions  export import controls  and tariff regulations 
our business could be harmed if we are unable to protect our proprietary technology 
we rely primarily on a combination of trade secrets  patents  copyright and trademark laws and confidentiality procedures to protect our technology 
despite these precautions  unauthorized third parties may infringe  copy or reverse engineer portions of our technology 
we do not know if current or future patent applications will be issued with the scope of the claims sought  if at all  or whether any patents issued will be challenged or invalidated 
in addition  we have obtained or applied for corresponding patents and patent applications in several foreign countries for some of our patents and patent applications 
there is a risk that these patent applications will not be granted or that the patent or patent application will not provide significant protection for our products and technology 
our competitors may independently develop similar technology that our patents do not cover 
in addition  because patent applications in the united states are not publicly disclosed until the patent is issued  applications may have been filed which relate to our technology 
moreover  there is a risk that foreign intellectual property laws will not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as united states intellectual property laws 
in the absence of significant patent protection  we may be vulnerable to competitors who attempt to copy our products  processes or technology 

table of contents our business could be harmed if we infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others 
there has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device and related industries 
we have been  and may be in the future  notified that we may be infringing intellectual property rights possessed by third parties 
if any such claims are asserted against our intellectual property rights  we may seek to enter into royalty or licensing arrangements 
there is a risk in these situations that no license will be available or that a license will not be available on reasonable terms 
alternatively  we may decide to litigate such claims or to design around the patented technology 
these actions could be costly and would divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel 
as a result  any infringement claims by third parties or claims for indemnification by customers resulting from infringement claims  whether or not proven to be true  may harm our business and prospects 
our future success will depend on the continued services of our key personnel 
the loss of any of our key personnel  particularly our key research and development personnel  could harm our business and prospects 
our success will also depend upon our ability to attract and retain other qualified managerial and technical personnel 
competition for such personnel  particularly software engineers and other technical personnel  is intense 
we may not be able to attract and retain personnel necessary for the development of our business 
we do not have any key man life insurance for any of our officers or other key personnel 
compliance with changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expenses 
changing laws  regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure  including the sarbanes oxley act of  new sec regulations and nasdaq national market rules  are creating uncertainty for companies such as ours 
these new or changed laws  regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations in many cases due to their lack of specificity  and as a result  their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies  which could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices 
as a result  our efforts to comply with evolving laws  regulations and standards have resulted in  and are likely to continue to result in  increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities 
in particular  our efforts to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act of and the related regulations regarding our required assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting and our external auditors audit of that assessment has required the commitment of significant financial and managerial resources 
we expect these efforts to require the continued commitment of significant resources 
further  our board members  chief executive officer  and chief financial officer could face an increased risk of personal liability in connection with the performance of their duties 
as a result  we may have difficulty attracting and retaining qualified board members and executive officers  which could harm our business 
if our efforts to comply with new or changed laws  regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to practice  our reputation may be harmed 
if  as of the end of our fiscal year  we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective  or if our auditors are unable to confirm our assessment  investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information  and the trading price of our stock price and our business could be adversely affected 
we are in the process of documenting  and plan to test during the current fiscal year  our internal control procedures in order to satisfy the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act 
commencing with september   the end of our fiscal year  the sarbanes oxley act requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and a report by our independent auditors addressing these assessments 
during the course of our testing we may identify deficiencies which we may not be able to remediate in time to meet the deadline imposed by the sarbanes oxley act for compliance with the requirements of section in addition  if we fail to achieve and maintain the adequacy of our internal controls  as such standards are modified  supplemented  or amended from time to time  we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal controls over financial 
table of contents reporting in accordance with section of the sarbanes oxley act 
effective internal controls are important to help produce reliable financial reports and to prevent financial fraud 
if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective as of the end of our fiscal year  or if our auditors are unable to attest that our management s report is fairly stated or they are unable to express an opinion on our management s evaluation or on the effectiveness of the internal controls  we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports  investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information  and the trading price of our stock and our business could be adversely affected 
there is a risk that our insurance will not be sufficient to protect us from product liability or other claims  or that in the future liability insurance will not be available to us at a reasonable cost  if at all 
our business involves the risk of product liability and other claims inherent to the medical device business 
we maintain product liability insurance subject to deductibles and exclusions 
there is a risk that our insurance will not be sufficient to protect us from product and other liability claims  or that product liability insurance will not be available to us at a reasonable cost  if at all 
an under insured or uninsured claim could harm our operating results or financial condition 
we use hazardous materials and products 
our research and development involves the controlled use of hazardous materials  such as toxic and carcinogenic chemicals and various radioactive compounds 
although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials comply with the standards prescribed by federal  state and local regulations  we cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials 
in the event of this type of accident  we could be held liable for any resulting damages  and any such liability could be extensive 
we are also subject to substantial regulation relating to occupational health and safety  environmental protection  hazardous substance control  and waste management and disposal 
the failure to comply with such regulations could subject us to  among other things  fines and criminal liability 
provisions in our certificate of incorporation and by laws and our stockholder rights plan may have the effect of discouraging advantageous offers for our business or common stock and limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
our certificate of incorporation  by laws and the provisions of delaware corporate law include provisions that may have the effect of discouraging or preventing a change in control 
in addition  we have a stockholder rights plan that may have the effect of discouraging or preventing a change in control 
these provisions could limit the price that our stockholders might receive in the future for shares of our common stock 
our stock price is volatile 
the market price of our common stock has been  and may continue to be  highly volatile 
we believe that a variety of factors could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate  perhaps substantially  including announcements and rumors of developments related to our business  or the industry in which we compete  quarterly fluctuations in our actual or anticipated operating results and order levels  general conditions in the worldwide economy  announcements of technological innovations  new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors  developments in patents or other intellectual property rights and litigation  and developments in our relationships with our customers and suppliers 

table of contents in addition  in recent years the stock market in general and the markets for shares of small capitalization and high tech companies in particular  have experienced extreme price fluctuations which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies 
any such fluctuations in the future could adversely affect the market price of our common stock  and the market price of our common stock may decline 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial instruments  other financial instruments  and derivative commodity instruments 
sfas no 
 disclosure of fair value of financial instruments  requires disclosure about fair value of financial instruments 
financial instruments consist of cash equivalents  short and long term investments  accounts receivable  accounts payable and debt obligations 
the fair value of these financial instruments approximates their carrying amount 
primary market risk exposures 
our primary market risk exposures are in the areas of interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we incur interest expense on loans made under a loan and security agreement with wells fargo foothill  inc the foothill agreement and a european line of credit 
the foothill agreement term loan accrues interest at the prime rate plus and the european line of credit accrues interest at the europe interbank offered rate plus 
at september   we had  outstanding under the foothill agreement and there were no amounts outstanding under the line of credit 
foreign currency exchange risk 
internationally  we currently operate in belgium and france 
our international business is subject to risks  including  but not limited to unique economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  foreign exchange rate volatility and other risks identified under the heading risk factors in part ii  item a above 
accordingly  our future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors 
substantially all of our sales outside the united states are conducted in us dollar denominated transactions 
we do operate two european subsidiaries  which incur expenses denominated in local currencies euro 
as such  our operating results and certain assets and liabilities that are denominated in euros are affected by changes in the relative strength of the united states dollar against the euro 
our expenses are positively affected when the united states dollar strengthens against the euro and adversely affected when the united states dollar weakens 
however  based on the level of operating expenses  we believe that the foreign currency exchange risk is not significant 
during fiscal  and  we incurred foreign currency exchange gains losses of   and  respectively
