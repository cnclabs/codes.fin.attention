item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provision of the private securities litigation reform act of regarding future events and the future results of meadow valley corporation that are based on current expectations  estimates  forecasts  and projections as well as the beliefs and assumptions of meadow valley s management 
words such as outlook  believes  expects  appears  may  will  should  anticipates or the negative thereof or comparable terminology  are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements are only predictions and are subject to risks  uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to foresee 
therefore  actual results may differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward looking statements 
factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to those discussed in this annual report on form k under the section entitled quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
you should not place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date of this annual report 
we undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward looking statements for any reason 
our income statement performance in fiscal year did not meet our expectations 
outstanding performances in both our css and cms were overshadowed by two very significant occurrences 
first  a highway project in utah gooseberry project suffered the worst single project loss in the history of the company an approximate million loss in  and second  two cms customers declared bankruptcy that necessitated an increase in our reserve for doubtful accounts in excess of approximately  the combined impact reduced the company s overall gross profit by approximately million 
one of our primary goals for was to make progress toward resolution of claims and litigation thereby  improving our balance sheet 
in that regard  exceeded our expectations 
during the course of the year  all five disputed contracts with the new mexico state highway and transportation department nmshtd had completed the laborious and delay ridden three tiered claim review process 
these five projects were completed between december and march by the end of  all five contracts had finally completed the entire claim review process 
during an extra mediation session in january  mutually agreed to by both parties  a settlement was reached on three of the five disputed contracts 
significant progress was also made on the claim with clark county nevada in that arbitration hearings began on february  also related to the clark county claim  a settlement agreement was reached with innovative construction systems  inc  a subcontractor to meadow valley  to arbitrate in lieu of litigate any residual issues between the parties upon conclusion of the clark county arbitration 
all of these positive steps have greatly lightened the burden pertaining to outstanding claims and litigation matters  and the influx of cash will improve our balance sheet and liquidity 
results of operations the following table sets forth statement of operations data expressed as a percentage of revenue for the periods indicated years ended december  revenue cost of revenue gross profit general and administrative expenses income loss from operations interest income interest expense other income net income loss year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue and backlog 
revenue improved to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  
the improved revenue resulted from a million increase  net of inter company sales  from the cms  offset by a decrease in revenue from the css of million 
the cms mvco form k 
table of contents revenue increase was due primarily to an approximate volume increase in from  the average unit sales price increased approximately 
in from backlog in the css increased to million compared to million a year ago 
css revenue was impacted less by the amount of the beginning backlog than by the progress schedules and nature of the contracts contained in the backlog at the beginning of revenue in the css was also affected by the gooseberry project 
because so much of our business stems from competitively bid public works  backlog will fluctuate depending upon the amount and type of contracts that we bid on and win 
bid bonds provided by our surety company are required on most of the contracts that we bid  therefore  any restrictions or limitations in the extension of surety credit can impact the amount and type of contracts available to be bid by our css 
surety credit limitations have contributed to the lack of growth in our backlog 
surety credit limits and conditions may improve as our financial performance improves  but there can be no assurance that surety credit will be increased 
gross profit 
consolidated gross profit decreased to million for from million for and consolidated gross margin  as a percent of revenue  decreased to in from in gross profit from css decreased to million in from million in and the gross profit margin decreased to from in the respective periods 
the decrease in the css gross profit margin was greatly affected by the gooseberry project 
we have recognized  in the current year  what we believe to be the total anticipated loss on the gooseberry project of approximately million  but can not assure that there may be not additional future losses 
this project is scheduled for completion in gross profit margins are affected by a variety of factors including  the quality and accuracy of the initial estimate  construction delays and difficulties due to weather or other conditions  availability of materials  the timing of work performed by other subcontractors and the physical and geological condition of the construction site 
gross profit from the cms increased to million in from million in and the gross profit margin decreased to from in the respective periods 
the decrease in the gross profit margin in the cms during is the result of only a slight increase of  in the average unit price  which was not sufficient to compensate for the increase in the unit cost 
the inability to raise prices while experiencing increased costs is the result of price competition in a challenging economic environment 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million for from million for the decrease resulted primarily from a 
million decrease in legal fees  offset by a 
million increase in the voluntary match contribution to the k plan 
interest income  expense and other income 
interest income for decreased to 
million from 
million for resulting primarily from a decrease in invested cash reserves 
interest expense remained relatively flat for at 
million compared to 
million for other income for increased to 
million from 
for resulting primarily from the gain on the disposal of property  equipment  land and mineral lease rights 
net income 
net income was 
million for as compared to a net income of 
million for the decrease in net income was the result of the reduction in gross profit  as discussed above  offset by a net increase in other income expense 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue and backlog 
revenue decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  
the decrease was the result of a million decrease in the css revenue offset by a million increase in revenue from the cms sold to non affiliates 
backlog decreased to million at december  compared to million at december  revenue may be impacted in any one period by the backlog at the beginning of the period 
because so much of our business stems from competitively bid public works  backlog will fluctuate depending upon the amount and type of contracts that we bid on and win 
bid bonds provided by our surety company are required on most of the contracts that we bid  therefore  any restrictions or limitations in the extension of surety credit can impact the amount and type of contracts available to be bid 
previous limitations to our surety credit have contributed to our declining backlog 
surety credit limits may improve as our financial performance improves  but there can be no assurance that surety credit will improve as there also exist insurance industry and individual insurance company dynamics that are unrelated to our performance 
gross profit 
consolidated gross profit increased to million for from million for and consolidated gross margin  as a percent of revenue  increased to in from in gross profit from the css increased to million in from million in and the gross profit margin increased to from in the respective periods 
the increase in the css gross profit margin was the result of reductions in costs related to claims and costs overruns on certain projects and by increased profit recognition related to several projects nearing completion at mvco form k 
table of contents december  gross profit margins are affected by a variety of factors including construction delays and difficulties due to weather conditions  availability of materials  the timing of work performed by other subcontractors and the physical and geological condition of the construction site 
gross profit from the cms increased to million in from million in and the gross profit margin increased to from in the respective periods 
the improved performance for the cms during is the result of a increase in revenue from that resulted from the expansion of the production and delivery capacity of the cms 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million for from million for the decrease resulted primarily from the recording of an impairment loss of goodwill in the amount of million during versus no impairment loss of goodwill during  a 
million decrease in administrative salaries  wages and related payroll taxes  and a 
million decrease in administrative vehicle expense  offset by a 
million increase in various employee incentive plans and a 
million increase in legal fees 
interest income and expense 
interest income for decreased to 
million from 
million for resulting primarily from a decrease in invested cash reserves 
interest expense decreased for to 
million from 
million for  due primarily to the lower variable interest rate on the line of credit in compared to the variable interest rate in net income loss 
net income was 
million for as compared to a net loss of million for the change from a net loss to a net income resulted primarily from our ability to increase gross profits and to decrease general and administrative expenses  reduced by a net reduction in other income expense 
liquidity and capital resources currently our primary need for capital is to finance the expansion of cms 
historically  our primary source of cash has been from operations 
as of december   we no longer have a line of credit 
per the terms of the loan agreement  we elected to allow the fully drawn pre existing line of credit to convert into a term agreement 
the interest rate will remain at chase manhattan bank s prime  plus requiring equal monthly principal plus interest payments through december  the term agreement is collateralized by all of our assets 
under the terms of the agreement  we are required to maintain a certain level of tangible net worth as well as maintain a ratio of total debt to tangible net worth 
we are in compliance with the covenants 
we are currently investigating credit arrangements  which will provide us with an available line of credit 
we feel that our cash reserves will provide sufficient liquidity until a line of credit agreement is in place

impact of inflation we believe that inflation has not had a material impact on our operations 
however  substantial increases in labor costs  worker compensation rates and employee benefits  equipment costs  material or subcontractor costs could adversely affect our operations in future periods 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
we believe our most critical accounting policies are the revenue recognition and cost estimation on certain contracts for which we use a percentage of completion accounting method  our allowance for doubtful accounts and the allowance for obsolete inventory 
the revenue recognition and cost estimation accounting method is applied by the css to heavy construction projects executed under multi year contracts with various customers 
approximately  and of total net revenue was recognized under the percentage of completion method of accounting during  and  respectively 
revenues and costs from fixed price and modified fixed price construction contracts are recognized for each contract on the percentage of completion method  measured by the percentage of costs incurred to date to the estimated total of direct costs 
direct costs include  among other things  direct labor  field labor  equipment rent  subcontracting  direct materials  and direct overhead 
general and administrative expenses are accounted for as period costs and are  therefore  not included in the calculation of the estimates to complete construction contracts in progress 
project losses are provided for in their entirety in the period in which such losses are determined  without reference to the percentage of completion 
as mvco form k 
table of contents contracts can extend over one or more accounting periods  revisions in costs and earnings estimated during the course of the work are reflected during the accounting period in which the facts that required such revisions become known 
the asset costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts represents revenue recognized in excess of amounts billed 
the liability billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts represents billings in excess of revenue recognized 
the complexity of the estimation process and all issues related to the assumptions  risks and uncertainties inherent with the application of the percentage of completion method of accounting affects the amounts reported in our financial statements 
a number of internal and external factors affect our percentage of completion estimates  including labor rate and efficiency variances  estimated future material prices and customer specification changes 
if our business conditions were different  or if we used different assumptions in the application of this accounting policy  it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported in our financial statements 
we are also required to estimate the collectibility of our account receivables 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the realization of these receivables  including the current credit worthiness of each customer and the related aging of the past due balances 
our provision for bad debts during the years ended december  and amounted to  and  respectively 
we determine our reserve by using percentages applied to certain aged receivable categories and percentages of certain types of revenue generated  as well as a review of individual accounts outstanding 
we are required to state our inventories at the lower of cost or market 
in assessing the ultimate realization of inventories  we are required to make judgments as to the future demand requirements and compare these with the current inventory levels 
our reserve requirements generally increase as our projected demand requirements decrease due to market conditions and longer than expected usage periods 
at december  and  inventories of  and  respectively  are net of reserves of  and  respectively 
it is possible that significant changes in required inventory reserves may continue to occur in the future if there is a further decline in market conditions or market activity 
summary of contractual obligations and commercial commitments contractual obligations at december   and the effects such obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flow in future periods  are summarized as follows payments due by period less than after total year years years years contractual obligations long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases purchase obligations other long term liabilities total contractual obligations recent accounting pronouncements see note summary of significant accounting policies and use of estimates  new accounting announcements adopted in the accompanying consolidated financial statements item for information regarding recent accounting pronouncements

table of contents known and anticipated future trends and contingencies with continued improvement in profitability and working capital  it is anticipated that our surety credit will increase proportionately  thereby allowing us to bid on and perform more and larger projects 
bidding opportunities within our focused market areas are ample for the size of our current surety program and it is reasonable to believe  given historical bidding success  that backlog may increase slightly during we believe that government  at all levels  will continue to be the primary source of funding for infrastructure work 
the national transportation legislation  tea  expired in september interim funding extensions have been granted while congress continues to work on a new six year highway bill 
it is expected  but cannot be assured  that new legislation will be enacted during to fund another six year transportation infrastructure program 
over the next few months until funding authority is finalized  state departments of transportation may not let as many contracts until they are fully aware of the funding available to them 
the competitive bidding process will continue to be the dominant method for determining contract award 
however  other innovative bidding methods will be tried and may gain favor  namely a plus b contracts  where the bidders proposals are selected on both price and scheduling criteria 
design build projects are becoming more common and are likely to increase in frequency 
in light of the rising needs for infrastructure work throughout the nation and the tendency of the current needs to out pace the supply of funds  it is anticipated that alternative funding sources will continue to be sought 
funding for infrastructure development in the united states is coming from a growing variety of innovative sources 
an increase of funding measures is being undertaken by various levels of government to help solve traffic congestion and related air quality problems 
sales taxes  fuel taxes  user fees in a variety of forms  vehicle license taxes  private toll roads and quasi public toll roads are examples of how transportation funding is evolving 
transportation norms are being challenged by federally mandated air quality standards 
improving traffic movement  eliminating congestion  increasing public transit  adding or designating high occupancy vehicle hov lanes to encourage car pooling and other solutions are being considered in order to help meet epa imposed air quality standards 
there is also a trend toward local and state legislation regulating growth and urban sprawl 
the passage of such legislation and the degree of growth limits imposed by it could dramatically affect the nature of our markets 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk generally represents the risk that losses may occur in the values of financial instruments as a result of movements in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
we do not have foreign currency exchange rate and commodity price market risk 
interest rate risk from time to time we temporarily invest our excess cash and restricted cash in interest bearing securities issued by high quality issuers 
we monitor risk exposure to monies invested in securities in our financial institutions 
due to the short time the investments are outstanding and their general liquidity  these instruments are classified as cash equivalents in the consolidated balance sheet and do not represent a material interest rate risk 
our primary market risk exposure for changes in interest rates relates to our long term debt obligations 
we manage our exposure to changing interest rates principally through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt 
we evaluated the potential effect that near term changes in interest rates would have had on the fair value of our interest rate risk sensitive financial instruments at december  assuming a basis point increase in the prime interest rate at december  the potential increase in the fair value of our debt obligations would have been approximately  at december  see note notes payable and note line of credit item in the accompanying consolidated financial statements
