critical accounting policies the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  as well as the related disclosures 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates

the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
goodwill as of december  the company had million of net goodwill recorded in its consolidated financial statements 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  the company assesses goodwill for possible impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of this asset may not be recoverable 
important factors that could trigger an impairment review include significant under performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in the company s stock price for a sustained period  and the company s market capitalization relative to net book value 
if the company determines that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  the company would measure any impairment based upon a projected discounted cash flow 
deferred income taxes as of december   the company had million of deferred tax assets recorded 
the deferred tax assets relate to net operating losses incurred in several of the states where the company operates 
the company has determined that it may not realize the full tax benefit related to certain of the deferred tax assets 
as such  a valuation allowance to reduce the carrying value of the deferred tax assets has been recorded 
long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles as of december   the company had million of net property and equipment along with net intangible assets of million 
the company evaluates long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets is measured by a comparison of the asset s carrying amount to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows change in the future  the company may be required to reduce the carrying amount of an asset to its fair value
