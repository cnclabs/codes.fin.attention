included in our sales office in phoenix is the primary location for our national and government accounts division  as well as our local  long distance and network services divisions 
our wholesale distribution center is located in tempe  arizona  which is the primary location from which we distribute products to our network of direct sales offices  dealers and vars 
in addition  we maintain a wholesale distribution office in the united kingdom that supplies inter tel s dealers and distributors throughout the uk and other parts of europe  and we have dealers in japan and mexico 
we also maintain a research and development and software sales office in the united kingdom 
key performance indicators that we use in order to manage our business and evaluate our financial and operating performance include revenues  costs and gross margins  and cash flows 

table of contents inter tel recognized revenue from the following significant sources of revenue end user sales through our direct sales offices and government and national accounts division 
we recognize revenue from sales of systems and services to end user customers upon installation of the systems and performance of the services  respectively  allowing for use by our customers of these systems 
we defer pre payments for communications services and recognize these pre payments as revenue as the communications services are provided 
dealer and var sales 
for shipments to dealers and other distributors  our revenue is recognized as products are shipped and services are rendered  because the sales process is complete 
title to these products passes when goods are shipped free on board shipping point 
resale of long distance 
we recognize revenue from long distance resale services as services are provided 
sales leases 
for our sales type lease accounting  we record the discounted present values of minimum rental payments under sales type leases as sales  net of provisions for continuing administration and other expenses over the lease period 
we record the lease sales at the time of system sale and installation as discussed above for sales to end user customers  and upon receipt of the executed lease documents 
the net rental streams are sold to funding sources on a regular basis with the income streams discounted by prevailing like term rates at the time of sale 
gains or losses resulting from the sale of net rental payments from such leases are also recorded as net sales 
maintenance 
maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance agreement 
costs and gross margins 
our costs of products sold primarily consist of materials  labor and overhead 
our costs of services performed consist primarily of labor  parts and service overhead 
total costs of goods and services sold decreased  or million  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in our consolidated gross margin percentage increased to in compared to in  attributable to several factors  including a higher proportion of recurring revenues from existing customers in our direct sales offices and government and national accounts division  increased maintenance and services revenues as a percentage of total sales  higher software content in our products  cost containment efforts  product design improvements  and efficiencies achieved with our manufacturing vendors 
sales of systems through our direct sales organization typically generate higher gross margins than sales through our dealers and vars  primarily because we recognize both the wholesale and retail margins on these sales 
conversely  sales of systems through our dealers and vars typically generate lower gross margins than sales through our direct sales organization  although direct sales typically require higher levels of selling  general and administrative expenses 
in addition  our long distance services and datanet products typically generate lower gross margins than sales of software and system products 
for revenues recognized under sales leases  we record the costs of systems installed as costs of sales 
our margins may vary from period to period depending upon distribution channel  product and software mix 
in the event that sales through our direct sales offices increase as a percentage of net sales  our overall gross margin could improve 
conversely  in the event net sales to dealers or sales of long distance services increase as a percentage of net sales  our overall gross margin could decline 
our operating results depend upon a variety of factors  including the volume and timing of orders received during a period  the mix of products sold and the mix of distribution channels  general economic conditions and world events impacting businesses  patterns of capital spending by customers  the timing of new product announcements and releases by us and our competitors  pricing pressures  the cost and effect of acquisitions and the availability and cost of products and components from our suppliers 
historically  a substantial portion of our net sales in a given quarter has been recorded in the third month of the quarter  with a concentration of such net sales in the last two weeks of the quarter 
in addition  we are subject to seasonal variations in our operating results  as net sales for the first and third quarters are frequently less than those experienced during the fourth and second quarters  respectively 
followed this historical pattern and we do not anticipate a significant change in this trend 
cash flows 
at december   inter tel s cash and short term investments totaled million 
we also maintain a million unsecured  revolving line of credit with bankone  na  which is available through june  and ordinarily used to support international letters of credit to suppliers  if 
table of contents necessary 
historically  our primary source of cash has come from net income plus non cash charges for depreciation and amortization expenses 
we have generated cash from continuing operations in every year since in  and  the company received net proceeds from stock offerings  offset in part by cash expended to repurchase the company s common stock 
in addition  inter tel historically has paid cash for capital expenditures of property and equipment or acquisitions 
inter tel has also received cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options and our employee stock purchase plan 
we believe our working capital and credit facilities  together with cash generated from operations  will be sufficient to develop and expand our business operations  to finance acquisitions of additional resellers of telephony products and other strategic acquisitions or corporate alliances  and to provide adequate working capital for the foreseeable future 
our consolidated revenues from all sources have declined slightly during each of the past three years  but at a lower rate than the decline in revenues of some of our primary competitors in the business communications systems market 
net sales for the years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively 
the slight decline in revenue in was primarily attributable to the sale of inter tel 
net in july excluding inter tel 
net revenues in  revenues increased by million from to the decline in net sales in resulted from the effect of general economic conditions and our customers appeared less willing to spend significantly on business communications systems 
although revenue declined slightly in  revenue increased in the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of the fourth quarter increase in net sales can be attributed in part to new product releases and improved sales in our long distance resale division 
however  we cannot provide assurance that the recent increase in revenue will continue in the future as we believe businesses may continue to be reluctant to significantly increase spending on enterprise communications systems in the near future 
the decline in revenue from business communications systems may also be attributable in part to business investments in systems made in the late s in anticipation of year issues 
we believe businesses may have been reluctant to make additional investments in these communications systems until their existing investments have been fully amortized over their useful life 
in addition  we believe many customers are hesitant to invest in traditional voice communication systems as they may be anticipating broader adoption of next generation communications systems 
we believe that enterprises continue to be concerned about their ability to increase revenues and profitability  in part due to the uncertain economic environment and slowdown in the past few years 
to maintain or improve profitability  we believe that businesses have attempted to reduce costs and capital spending 
we expect continued pressure on our ability to generate or expand sales and it is not clear whether business communications spending will improve significantly in the near term 
we cannot predict the nature  timing and extent of future business investments in communications systems and as a result  if and when our net sales will increase 
the markets we serve have been characterized by rapid technological changes and increasing customer requirements 
we have sought to address these requirements through the development of software enhancements and improvements to existing systems and the introduction of new systems  products  and applications 
inter tel s research and development efforts over the last several years have been focused primarily on the development of  and enhancements to  our axxess system  including adding new applications  enhancing our ip convergence applications and ip endpoints  developing unified communications applications  developing presence management applications  and developing speech recognition and text to speech applications 
more recently  inter tel s research and development efforts have been focused on the development of session initiation protocol sip interfaces and application as well as the development and a new line of multi protocol sip ip endpoints

net sales decreased to million in from million in  representing a decrease of million 
the decrease in net sales was primarily attributable to a reduction in sales through our direct sales offices and datanet division  offset in part by sales increases from inter tel netsolutions  dealer and international sales 
sales from our direct sales offices decreased in compared to  due primarily to a revenue shortfall in the first quarter of relative to the comparable period in the first quarter of represented our worst quarter of the year  due primarily to relatively weak economic conditions  uncertainties associated with the war in iraq and threatened terrorist attacks  and the impact of adverse weather conditions in the eastern united states and colorado 
sales from our government and national accounts division decreased slightly by  in compared to sales from our datanet division  which sells networking products through our direct sales offices  government and national accounts division and dealer channel  decreased million  or in compared to as a result of selling less third party lower margin products 
sales to our dealer network increased slightly by in the decrease in net sales from our direct sales offices  government and national accounts division and datanet division was also attributable to delayed customer buying decisions related to a continued deterioration in industry and macroeconomic conditions  as well as increased competitive pressures  among other factors identified above and further noted above 
inter tel recognized lower revenues due to lower sales volumes of new system installations collectively through the direct sales offices and government and national accounts group  offset in part by sales increases in our netsolutions division  and to a lesser extent  dealer sales and international operations 
in some instances  prices of various telecommunications systems decreased  and discounts or other highly competitive promotions that were offered to customers to generate sales resulted in lower revenue through both our direct and indirect channels 
although sales to new customers declined during  recurring revenues to existing customers increased in total dollars and as a percentage of total sales 
sales from netsolutions  our long distance resale division  increased  or million in to million compared to million in and represented the division with our largest percentage sales increase 
sales increased in our long distance division despite downward price pressure and significant competition 
increased sales volume has allowed netsolutions  our long distance resale division  to offer more competitive pricing  which improved sales to our existing customer base 
sales from network services agency  a commission based sales division acting as an agent to sell services for selected rboc s and clec s  decreased to million  largely due to changes in our commission compensation structure from one of the rboc s 
the change in the rboc s pricing structure resulted in a more deferred sales commission structure on local and network services such as t access  frame relay and other voice and data circuit services 
net sales from lease financing were flat in compared to  an increase of 
table of contents  and international revenues increased million  or in compared to  primarily as a result of a full year of revenues from swan  which was acquired in december and represented million of the increase

gross profit 
gross profit increased to million  or of net sales in  from million  or of net sales  in gross profit and gross margin increased in compared to as a result of several factors  including a higher proportion of recurring revenues from existing customers in our direct sales offices and government and national accounts division  increased maintenance and services revenues as a percentage of total sales  higher software content in our products  cost containment efforts  product design improvements  and efficiencies achieved with our manufacturing vendors 
during  recurring revenues from existing customers in our direct sales and national and government accounts channels increased as a percentage of total sales from these same channels from approximately in to approximately in existing customers accounted for a significant portion of our net sales from maintenance and other services  software additions and or upgrades  support  training and hardware products such as video conferencing  headsets wired and wireless  networking products and speakerphones 
our business communications platforms allow for system migration without the complete change out of hardware  which enables us to offer enhancements and new solutions through software only upgrades to our existing customers 
our gross margin is generally higher with recurring revenues because we incur less materials costs compared to new installations 
accordingly  our gross profit and gross margins improved in as a result of this recurring revenue percentage increase 
sales from netsolutions increased by  or million  in compared to although gross margin is generally lower in this division than our consolidated gross margin  the gross margin improved to in compared to in  based in part on our ability to negotiate more favorable pricing with vendors on higher resale volumes 
in addition  sales from our network services agency decreased  or million  in compared to  which partially offset our overall increase in gross margin 
this division generally receives commissions on network services we sell as an agent for rbocs 
these sales carry little to no equipment costs and generated margins of approximately in compared to in the decrease in sales from this division therefore partially offset our overall increase in consolidated gross profit and margins 
the overall increases in gross margin noted above were also offset in part by continued competitive pricing pressures in our direct sales offices  government and national accounts and dealer channels in  including pricing discounts or special competitor promotions on telephone system and software sales and related equipment 
our margins may vary from period to period depending upon distribution channel  product and software mix 
in the event that sales through our direct sales offices increase as a percentage of net sales  our overall gross margin could improve 
conversely  in the event net sales to dealers or sales of long distance services increase as a percentage of net sales  our overall gross margin could decline 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased to million  or of net sales in  compared to million  or of net sales in the increase is attributable in large part to the acquisition of swan solutions limited swan in december the increase is also attributable  to a lesser extent  to increased research and development spending related to convergence applications and new ip endpoint development 
in  research and development expenses were directed principally toward the continued development of the axxess software and systems  sip applications  presence management applications  unified messaging and voice processing software  speech recognition and text to speech applications  call center applications  unified communications applications  ip endpoint development  and certain cti and ivr applications 
we expect that research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we continue to develop and enhance existing and new technologies and products 
these expenses may vary  however  as a percentage of net sales 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased slightly in absolute dollars to million in  compared to million in these expenses also increased as a percentage of net sales to in compared to in these increases in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales were primarily due to higher selling expenses relative to total sales 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of net sales in part due to the decrease in consolidated net sales by million in compared to we incurred higher relative selling expenses through our combined direct sales offices and government and national accounts divisions  as we had increased sales personnel and sales training and support in anticipation of higher sales volumes and activity than actually materialized  particularly in the early part of we also incurred higher relative sales expenses in our long distance calling services division in relative to as a result of an increased number of sales personnel working directly for this division 
selling  general and administrative expenses also increased as a percentage of net sales due to higher costs of benefits  including higher health insurance for our associates 
our consolidated bad debt costs decreased in compared to and also decreased as a percentage of total net sales  based on improved credit and collections on existing accounts receivable 
depreciation expense was relatively flat in compared to we expect for the foreseeable future selling  general and administrative expenses will increase sequentially in absolute dollars assuming we increase sales and continue to enhance existing and develop new technologies and products 
these expenses may vary  however  as a percentage of net sales 
amortization of goodwill and purchased intangible assets 
we adopted sfas no 
effective the beginning of fiscal in accordance with sfas  we ceased amortizing goodwill

the net proceeds from this arbitration settlement were approximately million after taxes  or per diluted share for the year ended december  interest and other income 
in  interest and other income totaling million consisted primarily of interest income and foreign currency transaction gains 
other income in totaling million also consisted primarily of interest income and foreign currency transaction gains 
interest and other income decreased approximately  in compared to based on lower interest rates  despite a higher level of invested funds in part due to cash received from the litigation settlement noted above 
during  we recognized foreign currency transaction gains of  a decrease of  compared to gains of  in interest expense 
interest expense was flat at  in compared to  in other 
since july   the date of the sale of of inter tel 
net to comm services vianet  we have used the cost method of accounting for our remaining investment in inter tel 
net vianet 
accordingly  we have not recorded revenues or operating expenses of that entity since the date of sale 
in  the other component of this caption included an expense of approximately million related to the write down of inter tel s investment in inter tel 
net vianet 
in  other income included  related to a recovery of our investment and adjustment of projected costs to actual costs associated with the write down in the vianet investment 
at december   our net investment in vianet was recorded at no value 
income taxes 
our effective income tax rate for was relatively flat at compared to for the net deferred tax liabilities increased significantly in due primarily to accelerated depreciation of fixed assets  and temporary differences relating to leases in our total solution program 
most 
table of contents of the increase arose from deductions taken in the company s federal income tax return wherein the company decided in to elect to take bonus depreciation and accelerated depreciation of fixed assets and certain leased equipment when filing its return in the company filed a change in accounting method with the internal revenue service to utilize accelerated depreciation for the tax year 
effective may   the bonus depreciation increased from a to a depreciation deduction  which favorably impacted the tax deduction and increased the deferred liabilities for the depreciation deductions identified above generated a net operating loss that was not fully utilized in a carryback claim to  accordingly  the loss was carried forward 
this net operating loss created deferred assets for net operating loss carryforwards and certain tax credit carryforwards  each of which is separately identified in the components of deferred tax assets and liabilities schedule included in note k to the consolidated financial statements 
we expect these carryforwards to be fully utilized by our effective income tax rate for was not significantly impacted by these carryforwards 
we expect the full year tax rates to be comparable to the effective tax rate for net income 
net income for decreased to million  or per diluted share  compared to net income of million  or per diluted share  including the litigation settlement in the decrease was primarily attributable to income from net proceeds of an arbitration settlement in the net proceeds from this arbitration settlement were approximately million after taxes  or per diluted share for the year ended december  excluding the litigation settlement  we would have reported net income of million  or per diluted share in the decrease in net income of in  excluding the settlement  was primarily the result of lower profits on a lower volume of sales  higher research and development expenses and higher amortization costs  offset by higher gross profit margins described in further detail above 
year ended december  versus year ended december  net sales 
net sales decreased to million in from million in  representing a decrease of million

net  we have used the cost method of accounting for our remaining investment in inter tel 
net comm services 
accordingly  we have not recorded revenues or expenses of inter tel 
net since the date of sale 
the reduction in sales attributable to inter tel 
net was due entirely to our sale of of this subsidiary 
the decrease in net sales from our direct sales offices  government and national accounts division and dealer channel was also attributable to delayed customer buying decisions related to a continued deterioration in industry and macroeconomic conditions  among other factors as follows 
inter tel recognized lower revenues due to lower sales volumes of systems collectively through the direct sales offices  government and national accounts group and dealer channel  offset in part by sales increases in our long distance and network services divisions  sales from acquired mcleod operations  and to a lesser extent  lease finance and international operations

gross profit 
gross profit increased to million  or of net sales in  from million  or of net sales  in the increases in gross profit and gross margins were the result of several different factors 
gross profit and gross margin in improved as a result of no longer including the results of inter tel

net incurred selling  general and administrative expenses  excluding amortization  of million during excluding the operations of inter tel 
net for comparative purposes  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of net sales reflecting the lower percentage of total sales generated through our combined direct sales offices and government and national accounts divisions  including the acquired mcleod operations in january selling  general and administrative expenses also decreased as a percentage of net sales due to lower depreciation and bad debt costs relative to total sales 
in addition  the growth in sales from the resale of long distance calling services and datanet products led to lower selling  general and administrative costs relative to total sales

and other charges 
set forth herein is a further description of the items reflected in other charges during the years ended december  and  as well as subsequent events and activity occurring through inter tel 
net comm services vianet 
during the second quarter of  inter tel recorded a pre tax charge associated with inter tel 
net operations of million million after tax  related to the write down to net realizable value of network equipment and lease termination costs of certain redundant facilities 
the reserves established at the time of the write down have been fully utilized as of december  on july   inter tel sold of the stock of inter tel 
net  inc to comm services corporation for a note of million  collateralized by comm services stock  other marketable securities of the shareholders of comm services and of the net assets of inter tel 
net 
in connection with the sale of of inter tel 
net  we assessed the fair value of the remaining investment in inter tel 
net 
pursuant to sfas  we recorded a charge as of the close of the second quarter of of million million after tax associated with the impairment of our investment in inter tel 
net 
after the impairment charge  the carrying value of our investment the note receivable from comm services plus the ownership interest in comm services totaled million as of december  the charge was primarily non cash 
inter tel s management has not participated in the management of inter tel 
net since the sale in july as a result  since july   we have accounted for the remaining inter tel 
net comm services investment using the cost method of accounting 
on december   comm services entered into a merger agreement with vianet 
inter tel s investment in comm services was converted to approximately of vianet stock and as a result  the loan for the purchase was assumed by vianet and inter tel continued to hold collateral from the former shareholders of comm services until march during  the net investment in the notes receivable and interest in vianet formerly comm services was written down by million and was recorded in other assets at a carrying value of approximately million as of december   which approximated management s estimate of the related collateral value at that time 
during  and  inter tel 
net entered into operating lease agreements totaling approximately million from an equipment vendor for network equipment and software 
the lease agreements required inter tel 
net to purchase vendor maintenance on their products 
inter tel originally guaranteed the indebtedness 
in february  we executed an agreement with vianet and this vendor releasing inter tel from its guarantee of any and all of these obligations  and inter tel and vianet released the vendor from claims arising from the failure of the network equipment and software previously leased

divisions of the united states department of justice are investigating other companies and inter tel s participation in a federally funded e rate program to connect schools and libraries to the internet 
the justice department has provided inter tel with only a limited description of the evidence on which the investigations are based

if inter tel is convicted of any crime or subjected to sanctions  or debarred from certain government contracts or if penalties  damages or other monetary remedies are assessed against inter tel in connection with or related to these and other investigations  our business and operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
the existence and disclosure of the investigations may have already caused competitive harm to inter tel  and any unfavorable resolution to these matters may further harm inter tel s business 
we believe our working capital and credit facilities  together with cash generated from operations  will be sufficient to develop and expand our business operations  to finance acquisitions of additional resellers of telephony products and other strategic acquisitions or corporate alliances  and to provide adequate working capital for the foreseeable future 
however  to the extent additional funds are required in the future to address working capital needs and to provide funding for capital expenditures  expansion of the business or additional acquisitions  we will seek additional financing

as of december   we did not consider the milestone bonuses to be probable or reasonably estimable  nor had technological feasibility of the underlying technology been achieved to provide for viable product sales  therefore  no bonus payments have been accrued  and the monthly cost of services performed totaling approximately  has been expensed in research and development costs for the year ended december  off balance sheet arrangements as part of our ongoing business  we do not participate in transactions that involve unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes

critical accounting policies and estimates the methods  estimates and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our consolidated financial statements 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an on going basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
our experience and assumptions form the basis for our judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may vary from what we anticipate and different assumptions or estimates about the future could change our reported results 
we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical to us  in that they are important to the portrayal of our financial statements and they require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
in december  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition 
the company applies the provisions of sab to all revenue transactions 
sab supercedes sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
the primary purpose of sab is to rescind accounting guidance contained in sab related to multiple element revenue arrangements  superceded as a result of the issuance of eitf additionally  sab rescinds the sec s revenue recognition in financial statements frequently asked questions and answers the faq issued with sab that had been codified in sec topic  revenue recognition 
selected portions of the faq have been incorporated into sab while the wording of sab has changed to reflect the issuance of eitf  the revenue recognition principles of sab remain largely unchanged by the issuance of sab the issuance of sab did not have a material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 

table of contents accordingly  revenue is recognized when all four of the following criteria are met i persuasive evidence that arrangement exists  ii delivery of the products and or services has occurred  iii the selling price is both fixed and determinable and  iv collectibility is reasonably probable 
revenue derived from sales of systems and services to end user customers is recognized upon primary installation of the systems and performance of the services  respectively  allowing for use by our customers of these systems 
pre payments for communications services are deferred and recognized as revenue as the communications services are provided 
for shipments to dealers and other distributors  our revenues are recorded as products are shipped and services are rendered  because the sales process is complete 
these shipments are primarily to third party dealers and distributors  and title passes when goods are shipped free on board shipping point 
long distance services revenues are recognized as service is provided 
sales leases 
for our sales type lease accounting  we follow the guidance provided by fasb statement no 
 accounting for leases and fasb statement no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities a replacement of fasb statement no 
we record the discounted present values of minimum rental payments under sales type leases as sales  net of provisions for continuing administration and other expenses over the lease period 
we record the lease sales at the time of system sale and installation pursuant to staff accounting bulletin no 
 as discussed above for sales to end user customers  and upon receipt of the executed lease documents 
the costs of systems installed under these sales leases are recorded as costs of sales 
the net rental streams are sold to funding sources on a regular basis with the income streams discounted by prevailing like term rates at the time of sale 
gains or losses resulting from the sale of net rental payments from such leases are recorded as net sales 
we establish and maintain reserves against potential recourse following the resales based upon historical loss experience  past due accounts and specific account analysis 
the allowance for uncollectible minimum lease payments and recourse liability at the end of the year represents reserves against the entire lease portfolio 
management reviews the adequacy of the allowance on a regular basis and adjusts the allowance as required 
these reserves are either netted in the accounts receivable  current and long term components of net investments in sales leases on the balance sheet  or included in long term liabilities on our balance sheet for off balance sheet leases 
historically  our reserves have been adequate to cover write offs 
during the year ended december   our total reserve for losses related to the lease portfolio declined from to  primarily as a result of improved write off experience and accounts receivable agings 
should the financial condition of our customers deteriorate in the future  additional reserves in amounts that could be material to the financial statements could be required 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
we assess the impairment of goodwill and other identifiable intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
some factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant under performance relative to historical  expected or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  our market capitalization relative to net book value  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
when we determine that the carrying value of goodwill and other identified intangibles may not be recoverable  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  on january   we ceased amortizing goodwill arising from acquisitions completed prior to july  inter tel has tested goodwill for impairment using the two step process prescribed in sfas the first step is a screen for potential impairment  while the second step measures the amount of the impairment  if any 
inter tel has performed the first of the required impairment tests for goodwill as of december  and has determined that the carrying amount of goodwill is not impaired 

table of contents inter tel has adopted sfas effective january  application of the nonamortization provisions of sfas resulted in an increase in income from continuing operations before income taxes of approximately million in and allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
additional reserves or allowances for doubtful accounts are recorded for our sales type leases  discussed above in sales leases 
we establish and maintain reserves against estimated losses based upon historical loss experience  past due accounts and specific account analysis 
management reviews the level of the allowances for doubtful accounts on a regular basis and adjusts the level of the allowances as needed 
in evaluating our allowance we consider accounts in excess of days old as well as other risks in the more current portions of the accounts included 
if the financial condition of our customers or channel partners were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventories 
we value our inventories at the lower of cost principally on a standard cost basis  which approximates the first in  first out fifo method or market 
significant management judgment is required to determine the reserve for obsolete or excess inventory and we make our assessment primarily on a significant product by product basis for the immediately preceding twelve month period  adjusted for expected changes in projected sales or marketing demand 
inventory on hand may exceed future demand either because the product is outdated or obsolete  or because the amount on hand is more than can be used to meet estimated future needs 
we consider criteria such as customer demand  product life cycles  changing technologies  slow moving inventory and market conditions 
we write down our excess and obsolete inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value 
if actual customer demand  product life cycles  changing technologies and market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required in the future 
contingencies 
we are a party to various claims and litigation in the normal course of business 
management s current estimated range of liability related to various claims and pending litigation is based on claims for which our management can estimate the amount and range of loss  or can estimate a minimum amount of a loss 
because of the uncertainties related to both the amount and range of loss on the remaining pending claims and litigation  management is unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result from an unfavorable outcome 
as additional information becomes available  we will assess the potential liability related to our claims and pending litigation  revise our estimates and accrue for any losses to the extent that they are probable and the amount is estimable 
such revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operations and financial position 
however  at december   management did not believe that the ultimate impact of various claims and pending litigation would have a materially adverse impact on the company

investment portfolio 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our non trading investment portfolio 
inter tel maintains a portfolio of highly liquid cash equivalents typically maturing in three months or less as of the date of purchase 
inter tel makes investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards  as specified in our investment policy guidelines 
the company also maintains short term investments  which are all classified as available for sale  and have been recorded at fair value  which approximates cost 
short term investments include certificates of deposit  auction rate certificates  auction rate preferred securities  municipal preferred securities and mutual funds 
the auction rate securities are adjustable rate securities with dividend rates that are reset periodically by bidders through periodic dutch auctions generally conducted every to days by a trust company or broker dealer on behalf of the issuer 
the company believes these securities are highly liquid investments through the related auctions  however  the collateralizing securities have stated terms of up to thirty years

given the short term nature of these investments  and that we have no borrowings outstanding other than short term letters of credit  we are not subject to significant interest rate risk 

table of contents lease portfolio 
we offer to our customers lease financing and other services  including our total solutions program  through our inter tel leasing subsidiary

we maintain reserves for loan losses on all leases based on historical loss experience  past due accounts and specific account analysis 
although to date we have been able to resell the rental streams from leases under our lease programs profitably and on a substantially current basis  the timing and profitability of lease resales could impact our business and operating results  particularly in an environment of fluctuating interest rates and economic uncertainty
