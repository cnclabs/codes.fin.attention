item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this form k 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those indicated in such forward looking statements as a result of a number of factors  including those set forth below under risk factors and elsewhere in this form k 
company overview we are a global leader in the development  deployment  and support of core system software css

in addition to key products  we also provide support services  such as training  maintenance and engineering services  to our customers as required 
we believe that our products and services enable our customers to bring secure  leading edge products to market faster  while reducing their manufacturing and support costs and providing essential features and capabilities to enable product differentiation 
fiscal overview phoenix analyzes revenue along two dimensions a platform  with pcs and servers representing one category and non pc devices  including consumer and industrial devices  representing a second category  and 
table of contents b products  with core system software representing one category and applications representing the second category 
we disclose revenue breakdowns in three resulting sectors pc server core system software  pc server applications  and non pc devices including both css and applications which will be discussed in more detail under results of operations and revenues 
the pc server core system software sector is currently our largest  representing of our total revenue in fiscal  compared to of our total revenue in fiscal although revenue in this sector in fiscal decreased by approximately from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  we believe that our pc server core system software business is tracking trends in the pc industry reasonably well and that our market share is holding steady 
revenue in the pc server applications sector increased from million in fiscal  or of fiscal revenues  to million in fiscal  or of fiscal revenues 
revenue in the non pc device sector increased from million in fiscal  or of fiscal revenues  to million in fiscal  or of fiscal revenues 
the company expects each of these trends to continue in fiscal the company continues to make efforts to develop and implement its strategic plan to improve its business outlook and profitability 
we are expanding our partnerships with key system builders and channel partners  as well as with their top customers  to establish brand awareness of our products and ultimately to generate increased demand 
we also continue to re align resources geographically to better serve our customers  including refocusing field support to speed up customer adoptions in the applications businesses  and maintaining disciplines on discretionary spending 
as a result  operating expenses declined from million in fiscal  including a restructuring charge of million  to million in fiscal primarily due to the reduction in headcount that resulted from the organizational restructuring that the company undertook in fiscal during fiscal  we entered into an increased number of long term volume purchase agreements vpas with our larger odm and oem customers 
under vpas  customers commit to a fixed payment schedule for an agreed upon number of units  typically over the next several quarters 
as a result of the significant increase in the number of vpas entered into during fiscal  our deferred revenue balance increased from million at september  to million at september  see critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition 
we expect to continue to pursue longer term vpas with our larger odm and oem customer as a way to stabilize our core business  improve visibility for future revenues  and further strengthen our relationships with key odm and oem customers 
during fiscal  we also entered into an increased number of paid up license arrangements  under which our customers pay a fixed upfront fee for an unlimited number of units 
as a result  our revenues from such paid up license arrangements increased from million in fiscal  or of fiscal revenues  to million in fiscal  or of fiscal revenues 
we generally enter into such paid up license arrangements only with respect to pc server core system software that is approaching the end of its lifecycle or with respect to sales to our non pc device customers where we expect that the number of units will be relatively small 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  assumptions and judgments including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  impairment of long lived assets  goodwill and purchased intangible assets and taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of these estimates form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
table of contents and our recognition of revenue that is not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  are affected by our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the company has discussed the critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 
revenue recognition 
we license software under non cancelable license agreements and provide services including non recurring engineering efforts  maintenance consisting of product support services and rights to unspecified upgrades on a when and if available basis  and training 
in many cases our products are incorporated into the products of our oem odm customers 
revenues from software license agreements are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is probable 
royalty revenues from oems odms are generally recognized in each period based on estimated consumption by the oems odms of products containing our software  provided that all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
we normally recognize revenue for all consumption prior to the end of the accounting period 
however  for volume purchase agreements vpas we also recognize revenues for units estimated to be consumed by the end of the following accounting quarter  to the extent that the customer has been billed for such consumption prior to the end of the quarter and provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
since we generally receive quarterly royalty reports from our oems odms approximately to days following the end of a quarter  we have put processes in place to reasonably estimate the royalty revenues  including obtaining estimates of production from our oem odm customers  utilizing historical experience  and other relevant current information 
to date the variances between estimated and actual revenues have been immaterial 
although management believes that it has a reliable basis for making reasonable estimates  the actual results could differ depending on customer or market factors 
amounts that have been invoiced under vpas and relate to consumption beyond the following accounting quarter 
during an accounting period  deferred revenues increase or decrease primarily to the extent that the dollar amount of new vpas entered into during the period is greater or less than the revenue that is recognized during the period from the outstanding deferred revenue balance at the beginning of the period 
our deferred revenue balances increased during the first two quarters of fiscal  and declined in the last two quarters of fiscal we believe this reflects the likelihood that our customers executing vpas  who are primarily based in japan and the asia pacific region  are more likely to execute them just prior to their fiscal year ends  which are primarily december and march we expect this pattern to continue in fiscal  although we believe the increase in deferred revenues from million at september  to million at september  reflects our increased focus in fiscal on closing vpas 
we believe virtually all deferred revenue will be recognized as revenue within the next months 
actual results could differ from the estimates used and have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
allowance for sales and doubtful accounts 
we record provisions for estimated sales allowances against revenues in the same period as the related revenues are recorded 
provisions for doubtful accounts are recorded in general and administrative expenses 
at september  and  the allowance for sales and doubtful accounts was million and million  respectively 
these estimates are based on our assessment of the probable collection from specific customer accounts  the aging of the accounts receivable  historical sales returns  analysis of credit memo data  bad debt write offs  and other known factors 
if economic or specific industry trends worsen beyond our estimates  or if there is a deterioration of our major customers credit worthiness  or actual defaults are higher than our estimates based on historical experience  we would increase the allowances for sales and doubtful accounts which would impact revenue and expense  respectively  as appropriate 
intangible assets 
intangible assets include prepaid royalties  purchased technologies  goodwill and other intangibles 
at september  and  these assets  net of accumulated amortization  totaled million and million  respectively 

table of contents prepaid royalties represent payments to several third party technology partners for their software that is incorporated into certain of our products 
all other intangible assets were derived from our acquisitions 
the cost of the acquisitions is allocated to the assets and liabilities acquired  including intangible assets based on their respective estimated fair value at the date of acquisition  with the remaining amount being classified as goodwill 
the useful life of the intangible assets was estimated based on the period over which the assets were expected to contribute directly and indirectly to the future cash flows 
if assumptions regarding the estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges 
accordingly  the allocation of the acquisition cost to intangible assets and goodwill has a significant impact on our future operating results 
the original recorded values of intangible assets and goodwill are based on third party appraisals 
the allocation process requires the extensive use of estimates and assumptions  including estimates of future cash flows expected to be generated by the acquired assets 
in accordance with the terms of the purchase agreement for the acquisition of integrity science  inc isi in february  contingent consideration of million is to be paid out in equal annual increments beginning in fiscal providing that the developed technology purchased as part of the original business combination is still utilized within products at the annual milestone dates 
in june  we made the first payment of million in accordance with the earn out terms noted above  and recorded the payment as additional purchase price resulting in incremental goodwill 
see commitments under liquidity and capital resources for more details 
income taxes estimates of effective tax rates  deferred taxes assets and valuation allowance when preparing our financial statements  we estimate our income taxes based on the various jurisdictions where we conduct business 
this requires us to estimate our current tax exposure and assess temporary differences due to different treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes thereby resulting in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
in addition  on a quarterly basis  we perform an assessment of the recoverability of the deferred income tax assets  which is principally dependent upon our ability to achieve taxable income in specific geographies 
after examining the available evidence at september   we believe a valuation allowance of million was necessary for the us federal and state net deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowance was calculated in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting no 
accounting for income taxes sfas  which requires an assessment of both negative and positive evidence when measuring the need for a valuation allowance 
in accordance with sfas  evidence such as operating results during recent periods is given more weight than our expectations of future profitability  which are inherently uncertain 
our recent financial performance represented sufficient negative evidence to require a full valuation allowance against our us federal and state deferred tax assets under sfas we intend to maintain a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets until sufficient positive evidence exists to support realization of the us federal and state deferred tax assets

revenues by geographic region based on country of sale for fiscal years   and were as follows in thousands amount of revenues change of revenues north america japan taiwan other asian countries europe total revenues total revenues in fiscal increased by compared with fiscal revenues for fiscal from other asian countries decreased by  while revenues from taiwan and europe increased by and  
table of contents respectively  from fiscal the decrease in north america and other asian countries was primarily due to the migration from oems to odms  which generally have higher volumes and lower unit prices 
the increase in japan  taiwan  and europe was primarily due to a number of large paid up license arrangements that we entered into in taiwan and europe in fiscal year where all revenues were recognized up front and increased unit shipments as a result of a strengthening economy in some of these regions in fiscal in fiscal  revenues from north america decreased by while revenues in taiwan increased by from fiscal the decrease was the result of the continued softness in the north america pc market in and our north american customers shifting their manufacturing to taiwan 
revenues from japan and other asian countries decreased by and  respectively  due primarily to economic slowdown in those regions 
europe revenues continued to grow by from prior year due to increased sales in non pc and applications product 
in fiscal  north america  japan  and other asian countries revenues decreased while taiwan and europe revenues increased 
the decrease in japan and other asian countries was due primarily to the continued slowdown in the japanese and korean pc markets and economic weakness in those regions 
there was also a shift of revenues from the japanese branded oems to the taiwan odms 
the increase in taiwan and europe was attributed to a slight recovery in the local economies in north american revenues remained relatively flat from to pc server core system software revenues were million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal the decrease in fiscal revenue was primarily due to the continued migration of pc server manufacturing from our oem customers to our larger odm customers  resulting in lower overall average unit prices 
this trend was partially offset by an increase in pc units shipped across the entire pc market and a shift in pc market share from desktop pcs to notebook pcs  for which we receive a higher unit price 
revenues in this sector also benefited from an increased number of large paid up license arrangements in fiscal  as revenues related to such paid up arrangements increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal pc server applications revenues were million in fiscal as compared to million for fiscal the principal contributors to this revenue increase were a wider array of applications products available in the market and increased sales through our new distribution  reseller and system builder channels 
typically  sales to the system builders in this segment tend to follow a longer sales cycle  and we believe that the growth in total applications revenues reflect the progress we have made in winning key system designs and working with our customers as they roll out their products 
the last revenue sector is non pc devices  which includes both core system software and applications 
the non pc device sector recorded a significant increase in revenue to million in fiscal from million in fiscal we believe there is less revenue stability here because this sector includes a high proportion of non standard contracts  including paid up license arrangements  for which revenue is recognized upon contract execution 
while the results for fiscal are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future periods  we expect continued long term growth in this sector as more of our customers adopt x based technology for their non pc devices 
cost of revenues and gross margin cost of revenues consists of third party license fees  engineering service costs and amortization of purchased technology 
gross margin as a percentage of revenues were   and for the fiscal   and gross margin was million for fiscal year as compared to million for the same period in fiscal the increase in dollar amount was mainly related to higher revenues in combination with improved cost efficiencies in our post sales customer support group 
amortization of purchased technologies from business combinations for fiscal  and was million  million and million respectively 

table of contents research and development expenses research and development expenses were million  million  and million in fiscal   and  respectively 
as a percentage of revenues  these expenses represented   and in fiscals   and  respectively 
the decrease from fiscal to fiscal was primarily due to lower payroll and related expenses  as a result of the restructuring programs implemented in fiscal sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses were million  million  and million in fiscal   and  respectively 
as a percentage of revenues  these expenses represented   and in fiscal   and  respectively 
the decrease in dollar amount was primarily to lower payroll and related compensation expenses as a result of the fiscal restructuring program and tighter spending controls on marketing activities  partially offset by an increase in discretionary sales related expenses as a result of our enhanced channel building efforts and an increase in marketing program expenses related to increased product launches 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were million  million  and million in fiscal   and  respectively 
as a percentage of revenues  these expenses represented   and in fiscal   and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses remained relatively constant from fiscal to fiscal amortization of goodwill and acquired intangibles amortization of goodwill and acquired intangibles were million  million  and million  in fiscal   and  respectively 
the decrease in fiscal was due to the adoption of sfas on october   which eliminates the amortization of goodwill upon adoption 
stock based compensation the stock based compensation expenses were million  million  and million in fiscal   and  respectively 
charges in fiscal   and were primarily due to the amortization of options granted to purchase stock at exercise prices less than the fair market value on the measurement date 
restructuring costs restructuring charges credits during fiscal   and  were million  million  and million  respectively 
fiscal restructuring programs during fiscal  we implemented three restructuring programs in the first quarter of fiscal  the company announced a restructuring program that impacted approximately positions across all business functions and closed its facilities in irvine  california and louisville  colorado 
this restructuring resulted in employee termination benefit charges of million  estimated facilities exit expenses of million  and asset write offs in the amount of million 
all charges were recorded in the three months ended december  in accordance with emerging issues task force liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity eitf 
as of september   payments relating to the employee termination benefits were completed 
actual payments for employee termination benefits were lower than the original provision as of 
table of contents september  as a result  million of excess accrual was reversed in the fourth quarter of fiscal in addition  the company increased the restructuring liability related to the irvine  california facility by million  million  and million in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the second quarter of fiscal  and the third quarter of fiscal  respectively  to reflect changes in the assumptions made previously for both the length of time the space would remain vacant and the sublease rate when the company finds subtenants 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal the company decreased the restructuring liability related to the irvine  california facility by million  to reflect sublease activity 
the unpaid portion of million for facilities exit expenses are included under the captions accrued restructuring charges current and accrued restructuring charges noncurrent in the consolidated balance sheets 
in the second quarter of fiscal  phoenix continued its effort in aligning global engineering resources 
approximately positions across multiple business functions  primarily in research and development  were impacted by this effort 
this resulted in an employee termination benefit charge of million 
this charge is recorded in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas 
all terminations were completed as of march  no future services will be rendered under the previous employee agreements 
actual payments for employee termination benefits were lower than the original provision as of september  as a result  million of excess accrual was reversed in the fourth quarter of fiscal payments were completed as of september  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company furthered its restructuring program to align global engineering resources and streamline finance operations 
approximately positions across business functions  primarily in research and development and finance  were impacted by this program 
this resulted in an employee termination benefit charge of million  which is recorded in accordance with sfas actual payments for employee termination benefits were lower than the original provision as of march  as a result  million of excess accrual was reversed in the second quarter of fiscal as of june  all payments related to this plan were paid in full 
as a result of the fiscal restructuring programs  we estimate pretax savings in operating expenses to be million on an annualized basis 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more details on our restructuring plans implemented in fiscal fiscal restructuring program in october  the company announced a restructuring program that identified and eliminated approximately positions across all business functions from its global workforce  including several senior management positions 
this restructuring program was to reduce our on going operating expense level 
this reduction resulted in a net charge of million  comprised of million of severance charges in the first quarter of fiscal and million credit to adjust excess accruals in the fourth quarter of fiscal payments were completed as of september  final actual payments for employee termination benefits were lower than the original provision 
as a result  million of excess accrual was reversed in the fourth quarter of fiscal interest and other income  net net interest and other income was million  nil  and million in fiscal   and  respectively 
net interest and other income consist mostly of interest income  which is primarily derived from cash and short term investments  losses on disposal of assets and foreign exchange transaction gains and losses 
the interest income generated each period is highly dependent on available cash and fluctuations in government interest rates 
the average interest rate earned was approximately   and for fiscal 
table of contents   and  respectively 
in fiscal  we invested mostly in highly liquid short term taxable auction instruments and corporate notes 
interest income remained relatively flat at million during fiscal years  and  respectively 
losses on disposal of assets totaled million  nil  and million in fiscals  and  respectively 
losses in fiscals and mainly related to assets written off from the relocation of our headquarters and japan office  respectively 
gain loss on investment there was no gain loss on investment in fiscals and gain on investment was million in fiscal equity investments in companies in which we do not have significant influence  usually when ownership is less than are included in other assets for fiscal these investments are accounted for using the cost method 
these investments are assessed for impairment periodically through review of operations and indications of continued viability  such as subsequent rounds of financing 
in fiscal  we recorded a gain of million from the sale of our remaining equity investment and did not purchase additional equity investments in fiscal or provision for income taxes we recorded an income tax provision of million  million  and an income tax benefit of million  reflecting effective tax rates of   and in fiscal   and  respectively 
the effective tax rate in was significantly different from the expected tax benefit derived by applying the us federal statutory rate to the income before taxes primarily due to foreign income and withholding taxes assessed by foreign tax jurisdictions 
after examining the available evidence at september   we believe that a valuation allowance of million against our net us federal and state tax assets was necessary due to our operating results in recent periods 
the effective tax rate in was significantly different from the expected tax benefit derived by applying the us federal statutory rate to the loss before taxes primarily due to the net effect of a refund of taxes paid in prior years generated by a carry back of our us federal tax loss  offset by an increase in the valuation allowance for our us federal and state net deferred tax assets  and foreign income and withholding taxes after examining the available evidence at september   we believe that a full valuation allowance against our net us federal and state tax assets was necessary due to our operating results in recent periods 
the effective tax rates in differed from the expected benefit derived by applying the us federal statutory tax rate to the losses before taxes primarily due to the detriment of foreign withholding taxes offset by research and development credits  state taxes and earnings taxed at rates less than the us federal statutory rate

during fiscal the company did not repurchase any shares of its common stock 
in february  the board of directors authorized a program to repurchase up to million of outstanding shares of common stock over a month period 
in fiscal  we repurchased approximately  shares at a cost of approximately million under the repurchase program 
during fiscal  the company repurchased approximately  shares of its common stock at a cost of million under the fiscal program 
commitments we have commitments under non cancelable operating leases ranging from one to ten years for million 
the operating lease obligations include a net lease commitment for the irvine location of million  after sublease income of million 
the irvine net lease commitment was included in the company s fiscal first quarter restructuring plan 
see note for further information on the company s restructuring plans 
on september   our future commitments were as follows in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations 
table of contents there were no material commitments for capital expenditures or non cancelable purchase commitments as of september  note fiscal year note fiscal years note fiscal years note fiscal years and beyond off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet agreements in fiscal we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and cash available from future operations will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 
new accounting pronouncements 
on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb statement no 
revised  share based payment  which is a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
statement r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in statement r is similar to the approach described in statement however  statement r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
the new standard will be effective for public entities in the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after june  the company has not yet assessed the impact of adopting this new standard 
in march  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
eitf provides guidance on other than temporary impairment models for marketable debt and equity securities accounted for under sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  and sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments held by not for profit organizations  and non marketable equity securities accounted for under the cost method 
the eitf developed a basic three step model to evaluate whether an investment is other than temporarily impaired 
the effective date of the recognition and measurement provisions of eitf has been delayed by the financial accounting standards board 
the company does not expect the adoption of eitf to have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
risk factors the additional following factors should be considered carefully when evaluating our business 
fluctuations in operating results our future operating results may vary substantially from period to period 
the timing and amount of our license fees are subject to a number of factors that make estimating revenues and operating results prior to the end of a quarter uncertain 
while we receive recurring revenues from royalty based license agreements and some agreements contain minimum quarterly royalty commitments  a significant amount of license fees in any quarter is dependent on signing agreements and delivering the licensed software in that quarter 
generally  we experience a pattern of recording or more of our quarterly revenues in the third month of the quarter 
we have historically monitored our revenue bookings through regular  periodic worldwide forecast reviews within the 
table of contents quarter 
there can be no assurances that this process will result in our meeting revenue expectations 
operating expenses for any year are normally based on the attainment of planned revenue levels for that year and are generally incurred ratably throughout the year 
as a result  if revenues were less than planned in any period while expense levels remain relatively fixed  our operating results would be adversely affected for that period 
in addition  unplanned expenses could adversely affect operating results for the period in which such expenses were incurred 
product development our long term success will depend on our ability to enhance existing products and to introduce new products timely and cost effectively that meet the needs of customers in existing and emerging markets 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in developing new products or in enhancing existing products or that those new and or enhanced products will be introduced before our competitors make their introductions  or that those products will meet market requirements 
delays in introducing new products can adversely impact acceptance and revenues generated from the sale of such products 
we have  from time to time  experienced such delays 
our software products and their enhancements contain complex code that may contain undetected errors and or bugs when first introduced 
there can be no assurance that new products or enhancements will not contain errors or bugs that will adversely affect commercial acceptance of such new products or enhancements 
the introduction of new products in the short term will also depend on adoption of our phoenix cme and applications as well as the overall market demand for pcs and other digital devices 
uncertain geopolitical environment and unfavorable economic and market conditions adverse economic conditions in certain geographic regions have contributed to recent slowdowns in the pc and information appliance industries and could continue to impact our business  resulting in reduced demand for our products as a result of a decrease in capital spending by our customers  changes in customer production strategies  increased price competition for our products  partially as a consequence of price pressure in the pc markets  and higher operating expenses as a percentage of revenues 
recent political turmoil in many parts of the world  including terrorist and military actions  may continue to put pressure on global economic conditions 
if the global economic and market conditions do not improve  or if they deteriorate further  we may continue to experience material adverse impacts on our business  operating results and financial condition as a consequence of the above factors or otherwise 
changes in industry and market conditions in response to changes in industry and market conditions  we may be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring  disposing of  or otherwise exiting businesses 
any decision to limit investment in  or dispose of or otherwise exit businesses may result in the recording of special charges  such as technology related write offs  workforce reduction costs  or changes relating to consolidation of excess facilities 
our estimates with respect to the useful life or ultimate recoverability of our carrying basis of assets  including purchased intangible assets  could change as a result of such assessments and decisions 
further  our estimates relating to the liabilities for excess facilities are affected by changes in real estate market conditions 
additionally  we are required to perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances 
there can be no assurance that future goodwill impairment tests will not result in a charge to earnings 
dependence on new product releases by our customers successful introduction of new products is key to our success in both our css and new applications businesses 
frequently our new products are used in our customers new products  making each of us dependent 
table of contents on the other for product introduction schedules 
it can happen that a customer may not be able to introduce one of his new products for reasons unrelated to our new product 
in these cases  we would not be able to ship our new product until the customer had resolved his other problems 
due to market uncertainties in certain geographic regions  some customers have delayed their product introductions  specifically in the non pc segment 
if our customers continue to delay their product introductions  our ability to generate revenue from our new application products could be adversely affected 
risks in acquisitions our growth is dependent upon market growth  our ability to enhance our existing products and introduction of new products on a timely basis 
we have and will continue to address the need to develop new products through acquisitions of other companies and technologies 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including the following difficulties in integrating the operations  technologies  products and personnel of the acquired companies  diversion of management s attention from normal daily operations of the business  potential difficulties in completing projects associated with in process research and development  difficulties in entering markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions  insufficient revenues to offset increased expenses associated with acquisitions  and potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies 
acquisitions may also cause us to issue common stock that would dilute our current shareholders percentage ownership  assume liabilities  record goodwill and non amortizable intangible assets that will be subject to impairment testing and potential periodic impairment charges  incur amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets  incur large and immediate write offs of in process research and development costs  or become subject to litigation 
mergers and acquisitions of high technology companies are inherently risky  and no assurance can be given that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful or will not adversely affect our business  operating results  or financial condition 
failure to manage and successfully integrate acquisitions we make could harm our business and operating results in a material way 
even when an acquired company has already developed and marketed products  there can be no assurance that product enhancements will be made in a timely fashion or that all pre acquisition due diligence will have identified all possible issues that might arise with respect to such products 
we have not made acquisitions that result in in process research and development expenses being charged in an individual quarter 
these charges may occur in future acquisitions in any particular quarter resulting in variability in our quarterly earnings 
litigation risks from time to time  we become involved in litigation claims and disputes in the ordinary course of business 
we are currently involved in several lawsuits 
litigation can be expensive  lengthy and disruptive to normal 
table of contents business operations 
moreover  the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict 
an unfavorable resolution of a particular lawsuit could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  or financial condition 
protection of intellectual property we rely on a combination of patent  trade secret  copyright  trademark  and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights in our software products 
there can be no assurance that these protections will be adequate or that competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology 
in addition  copyright and trade secret protection for our products may be unavailable or unreliable in certain foreign countries 
as of september   we have been issued patents in the us and had patent applications in process in the united states patent and trademark office 
on a worldwide basis  we have been issued patents with respect to our product offerings and have patent applications pending with respect to certain of the products we market 
we maintain an active internal program designed to identify employee inventions worthy of being patented 
there can be no assurance that any of the pending applications will be approved and patents issued or that our engineers will be able to develop technologies capable of being patented 
also  as the number of software patents increases  we believe that companies that develop software products may become increasingly subject to infringement claims 
there can be no assurance that a third party will not assert that their patents or other proprietary rights are violated by products offered by us 
any such claims  whether or not meritorious  may be time consuming and expensive to defend  can trigger indemnity obligations owed by us to third parties and may have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
infringement of valid patents or copyrights or misappropriation of valid trade secrets  whether alleged against us  or our customers  and regardless of whether such claims have merit  could also have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
effective tax rates our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have varying statutory rates or by changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof 
entrance into new or developing markets as we focus on new market opportunities  we will increasingly compete with large  established suppliers as well as start up companies 
some of our current and potential competitors may have greater resources  including technical and engineering resources  than we do 
additionally  as customers in these markets mature and expand  they may require greater levels of service and support than we have provided in the past 
we expect that demand for these types of service and support may increase in the future 
there can be no assurance that we can provide products  service  and support to effectively compete for these market opportunities 
further  provision of greater levels of services may result in a delay in the timing of revenue recognition 
changes in financial accounting standards we prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
gaap are subject to interpretation by the financial accounting standard board  the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa  the sec and various bodies appointed by these organizations to interpret existing rules and create new accounting policies 
accounting policies affecting software revenue recognition  in particular  have been the subject of frequent interpretations  which have had a profound effect on the way we license our products 
as a result of the enactment of the sarbanes oxley act in and the related scrutiny of accounting policies by the sec and the various national and international accounting industry bodies  we expect the frequency of accounting policy changes to accelerate 

table of contents future changes in financial accounting standards  including pronouncements relating to revenue recognition  may have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective 
importance of microsoft and intel for a number of years  we have worked closely with leading software and semiconductor companies  including microsoft and intel  in developing standards for the pc industry 
although we remain optimistic regarding relationships with these industry leaders  there can be no assurance that leading software and semiconductor companies will not develop alternative product strategies that could conflict with our product plans and marketing strategies 
action by such companies may adversely impact our business and results of operations 
presently  there is little overlap or conflict in our product offerings  although these companies may incorporate some functionality that has traditionally resided in css 
we must continuously create new features and functions to sustain  as well as increase  our software s added value to our customers 
there can be no assurances that we will be successful in these efforts 
attraction and retention of key personnel our ability to achieve our revenue and operating performance objectives will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain top tier engineering  sales  marketing  and administrative personnel 
our newer products are based in part on technologies and industry standards that are different from css technologies 
as such  we need to attract and retain key personnel with expertise in new areas 
accordingly  failure to attract and retain employees with the necessary skills could adversely affect our business and operating results 
all of our employees  including executive officers and key personnel  are employees at will 
dependence on key customers  concentration of credit the loss of any key customer and our inability to replace revenues provided by a key customer may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
our customer base includes large oems in the pc  semiconductor and internet markets  system integrator value added resellers  and motherboard manufacturers 
as a result  we maintain individually significant receivable balances due from some of them 
if these customers fail to meet guaranteed minimum royalty payments and other payment obligations  our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 
as of september   sony corporation and gigabyte technology co 
ltd 
accounted for and respectively of our total accounts receivable 
as of september  and  one customer  fujitsu limited  accounted for and  respectively of our total accounts receivable 
there are no other customers with more than of our total accounts receivable 
competition the markets for our products are intensely competitive and we expect both product and pricing competition to increase 
increased competition could result in pricing pressures  reduced margins  or the failure of one or more of our products to achieve or maintain market acceptance  any of which could adversely affect our business 
the company competes for css sales primarily with in house research and development r d departments of pc manufacturers that may have significantly greater financial and technical resources  as well as closer engineering ties and experience with specific hardware platforms  than those of the company 
major oem companies which may use their own internal bios r d personnel include dell computer corporation  hewlett packard company  ibm corporation workstation and server only  toshiba corporation  and intel corporation 
in addition  some of these competitors are also our customers 
any inability to effectively manage these complicated relationships with customers and suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  and financial condition and accordingly affect our chances of success 

table of contents the company also competes for system software business with other independent suppliers  including american megatrends inc  a privately held company  and other small bios companies such as general software  inc and insyde software  inc in the applications software area  as with css  the company competes with in house and third party company solutions to access the protected area of hard drives 
large enterprise solution competitors such as altiris incorporated and symantec corporation  as well as smaller third party companies such as xpoint technologies incorporated and softthinks incorporated are the primary players 
the company s applications that reside in the protected area compete with individual component software and diagnostic and repair software from other companies  as well as with pc manufacturer developed solutions 
the principal competitive factors in the markets in which we presently compete and may compete in the future include the ability to provide a broad range of products and services  product performance  price  the ability to introduce new products timely  and market share 
international sales and activities revenues derived from the international sales of our css product families comprise a majority of total revenues 
there can be no assurances that we will not experience significant fluctuations in international revenues 
while the major portion of our license fee or royalty contracts are us dollar denominated  we have entered into a number of contracts denominated in local currencies 
we have international sales and engineering offices in germany  the netherlands  japan  korea  taiwan  hong kong  and china 
our operations and financial results may be adversely affected by factors associated with international operations  such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates  uncertainties related to regional economic circumstances  political instability in emerging markets  difficulties in attracting qualified employees  and language  cultural and other difficulties managing foreign operations 
volatile market for phoenix stock the market for our stock is highly volatile 
the trading price of our common stock has been  and will continue to be  subject to fluctuations in response to operating and financial results  changes in demand for our products and services  announcements of technological innovations  the introduction and market acceptance of new technologies by us or our competitors  changes in our product mix or product direction or the product mix or direction of our competitors  pricing pressure from our customers and competitors  changes in our revenue mix and revenue growth rates  changes in expectations of growth for the pc industry  the overall trend toward industry consolidation both among our competitors and customers  the timing and size of orders from customers  our ability to achieve targeted cost reductions  and other events or factors which we may not be able to influence or control 
statements or changes in opinions  ratings or earnings estimates made by brokerage firms and industry analysts relating to the markets in which we do business  companies with which we compete or relating to us specifically could have an immediate and adverse effect on the market price of our stock 
in addition  the stock market has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market price for many small capitalization  high technology companies and have often included factors other than the operating performance of these companies 
if our market value decreases below our net book value  we may have to record a charge for impairment of goodwill 

table of contents certain anti takeover effects our certificate of incorporation  bylaws and stockholder rights plan and the delaware general corporation law include provisions that may be deemed to have anti takeover effects and may delay  defer or prevent a takeover attempt that stockholders might consider in their best interests 
these include provisions under which members of the board of directors are divided into three classes and are elected to serve staggered three year terms 
business disruptions while we have not been the target of software viruses specifically designed to impede the performance of our products  such viruses could be created and deployed against our products in the future 
similarly  experienced computer programmers or hackers may attempt to penetrate our network security or the security of our web sites from time to time 
a hacker who penetrates our network or web sites could misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions of our services 
we might be required to expend significant capital and resources to protect against  or to alleviate  problems caused by virus creators and or hackers 
in addition  acts of war  power shortage  natural disasters  acts of terror  and regional and global health risks could impact our ability to conduct business in certain regions 
any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations  and financial condition 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations 
interest rate risk we consider investments purchased with an original or remaining maturity of less than three months at date of purchase to be cash equivalents 
the following table summarizes our cash and cash equivalents and total investments in thousands september  cash and cash equivalents short term investment total our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
our investments are in debt instruments of the us government and its agencies  and in high quality corporate issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
at any time  a sharp increase in interest rates could have a material impact on interest earnings for our investment portfolio 
the following table presents the hypothetical changes in fair value of investment securities held at september  and that are sensitive to changes in interest rates in thousands valuation of securities given an interest rate decrease of x basis points fair value as of september  valuation of securities given an interest rate increase of x basis points bps bps bps bps bps bps auction instrument and corporate notes valuation of securities given an interest rate decrease of x basis points fair value as of september  valuation of securities given an interest rate increase of x basis points bps bps bps bps bps bps auction instrument and corporate notes these instruments are not leveraged and are considered available for sale investments 
the modeling technique used measures the change in fair value arising from selected potential changes in interest rates 
market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus basis points bps  bps  and bps 
a basis point is defined as one hundredth of a percentage point 
we protect and preserve our invested funds by limiting default  market and reinvestment risk 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities will have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if there is a decline in interest rates 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations  or we may suffer a loss in principal if we are forced to sell securities  which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates as stated above 
foreign currency risk international sales are primarily sourced in their respective countries and are mostly denominated in us dollars 
these subsidiaries incur most of their expenses in the local currency 
accordingly  all foreign 
table of contents subsidiaries use the local currency as their functional currency 
our international business is subject to risks typical of an international business  including  but not limited to differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange rate volatility 
accordingly  our future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors 
our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations arises in part from inter company accounts in which costs incurred in the united states are charged to our foreign sales subsidiaries 
these inter company accounts are typically denominated in the functional currency of the foreign subsidiary in order to centralize foreign exchange risk with the parent company in the united states 
we are also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars in consolidation 
the impact from a hypothetical percent appreciation depreciation of the us dollar from september  and market rates would be immaterial on our net income 
investments in equity securities we have historically made investments in several privately held companies 
these nonmarketable investments are accounted for under the cost method  as ownership is less than percent and we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating  financing and investing activities of the investee companies 
these investments are inherently risky as the market for the technologies or products they have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize 
it is possible that we could lose our entire initial investment in these companies 
we did not record any impairment charges in fiscals   or at september   the carrying value of our remaining investments was zero
