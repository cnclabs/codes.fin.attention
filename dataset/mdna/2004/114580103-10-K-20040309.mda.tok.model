item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes in item of this report 
the discussion contains forward looking statements that involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties  including those set forth below under factors that may affect future results 
overview we develop software and hardware platforms that original equipment manufacturers  or oems  developers and corporate information technology managers build into their communications systems 
customers incorporate our products into applications  systems and services that allow voice  fax and data to be distributed over both internet protocol  or ip  packet based networks  which we refer to as the new network  and the traditional circuit switched telephone network 
we supply products for media processing  network interface  call control and signal processing  including protocols that allow internet and traditional telephony systems to communicate 
we measure our operating success using both financial and market metrics 
the financial metrics include revenue  gross profit  operating expenses  and income from continuing operations  as well as working capital and cash provided by operating activities 
other key metrics include the total number of enterprise and service provider customers  customers whose purchases exceed  and the portion of our revenue that is generated by the sales of products for applications in the new network 
our long term business model stresses our commitment to establishing and maintaining close customer relationships and to continuing to develop innovative products 
the most significant trend that has impacted our business has been the unfavorable economic conditions affecting the communications sector 
this had resulted in a decrease in our revenue from to and from to furthermore  we experienced revenue decreases for the first two quarters of when compared to the corresponding quarters of sales of products  particularly for applications in the new network  to oems for use by large service providers have declined most significantly over these periods 
in response to the revenue decreases  we implemented expense control programs to reduce operating expenses  while at the same time  we have continued to invest in developing products that we believe our customers will need when the economy further improves 
we are seeing signs that the economic conditions in our industry may be improving since revenue for the third and fourth quarter of exceeded the revenue in the corresponding periods of  and we expect the revenue for each quarter of to exceed the revenue for each quarter of despite these economic conditions  we have been able to increase our cash and marketable debt securities balances from million at december  to million at december  this was accomplished primarily through income tax refunds  operating expense reductions  inventory reductions  and the sale of a business segment 
if economic conditions do not continue to improve or if they weaken again  we may experience adverse effects on our business  operating results  and cash and marketable debt securities balances 
application of critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
we make estimates and assumptions in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenue and expenses  and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
however  actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following critical accounting policies require the use of significant judgment and estimates in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
this listing is not a comprehensive list of all of our significant accounting policies 
for further information regarding the application of these and other accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
revenue recognition revenue from product sales is recognized upon shipment to the customer which constitutes delivery  provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
in determining when to recognize revenue we often are required to exercise judgment 
to the extent that one or more of these criteria are not met  which has occurred from time to time  revenue is deferred until such time as all four conditions are satisfied 
we record a provision for estimated sales returns and allowances on product sales in the same period as the related revenue is recorded 
these estimates are based on historical sales returns  analysis of credit memo data and other known factors 
actual results could differ from these estimates and could therefore impact our results of operations and cash flows 
allowances for doubtful accounts accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
the estimated allowance for doubtful accounts is based primarily on a specific analysis of accounts in the receivable portfolio and a general reserve based on the aging of receivables 
while management believes the allowance to be adequate  if the financial condition of our customers were to change or deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required and could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
inventory allowances we evaluate our inventories for estimated excess quantities and obsolescence 
this evaluation includes analyses of sales levels by product and projections of anticipated future demand 
in addition  we assess the impact of changing technology on our inventory 
we provide reserves for inventories that are considered excess or obsolete 
if future demand or market conditions are different than our projections  additional inventory reserves may be required and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period in which the revision is made 
if future demand or market conditions are more favorable and products for which reserves have been provided become more marketable and are sold  our gross profit could improve 
these actions could impact both our results of operations and our cash flows 
intangible assets we review our intangible assets for impairment periodically and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the evaluation of the recoverability of our intangible assets includes assumptions regarding estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with these assets and other factors 
if these estimates or assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
such an impairment charge would impact the results of operations  but would not directly impact our cash flows 
all of our remaining net intangible assets are being amortized  with original useful lives of approximately five to ten years 
deferred tax assets we assess the carrying value of our deferred tax assets to determine if it is more likely than not that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income of the appropriate type in each tax jurisdiction in which we operate in order to realize these assets 
this assessment requires us to make estimates and assumptions about our future profitability 
prior to  our assessment indicated that it was more likely than not that we would be able to realize our deferred asset and therefore we did not record any valuation allowances 
in  we reduced the deferred tax asset to its estimated realizable value by recording a valuation allowance 
in determining the carrying value of the deferred tax assets as of december   we are assuming profitability in the future and that it is more likely than not that we will be able to realize these net deferred assets 
this assumption is based in part upon our history of profitability and our profitability for the year ended december  if current economic conditions weaken or future results of operations are less than expected  future assessments may result in a determination that all or a portion of the remaining deferred tax assets are not realizable 
as a result  we may need to establish additional valuation allowances for all or a portion of the deferred tax assets  which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
accrued warranty costs we accrue for warranty costs based on historical trends in product return rates and the expected material and labor costs to provide warranty services 
if we were to experience an increase in warranty claims compared with our historical experience  or if costs of servicing warranty claims were greater than the expectation on which the accrual had been based  our gross profits could be adversely affected 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report for activity in our reserves for estimated warranty costs 
discontinued operations prior to february   we were organized and reported the results of our operations in three operating segments  brooktrout technology  brooktrout software  and interspeed 
on february   our board of directors adopted formal plans to discontinue our brooktrout software and interspeed segments 
we have accounted for these businesses as discontinued operations 
these businesses were substantially disposed of prior to december   and adjustments recorded in primarily reflect additional proceeds and changes in estimates to the amounts recorded related to gains or losses on disposal 
for the years ended december  and  we recorded total gains from discontinued operations of million and million  respectively  while in  there were no gains or losses from discontinued operations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
results of operations the following discussion focuses on our results from continuing operations 
the table below sets forth certain consolidated statements of operations data as a percentage of total revenue for the periods presented 
years ended december  domestic revenue international revenue total revenue cost of product sold gross profit operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative total operating expenses operating loss other income expense  net net gain loss on investments equity in loss of affiliates interest income  net and other total other income expense  net income loss before income taxes income tax provision benefit income loss from continuing operations revenue the following table presents our domestic and international revenue years ended december  dollars in thousands domestic revenue    international revenue  principally export   total revenue    vs 
revenue in was million compared to million in  an increase of approximately 
while our sales to domestic oems and service providers decreased  particularly in the first two quarters  we experienced an increase in sales to our vars and enterprise customers in the last two quarters of many of our customers resumed spending on communications equipment  which had slowed in both and in comparison to  international revenue declined by million 
the decrease was the result of reduced sales to pacific rim and european customers  partially offset by favorable foreign currency exchange rates that increased revenue in by approximately million 
during  revenue from the sales of products for applications in the new network accounted for approximately of total revenue  as compared to of total revenue for revenue from captaris  inc accounted for of total revenue in compared to in we expect that revenue from captaris will continue to be greater than of total revenue for in  approximately of our customers each purchased over  of products  in aggregate representing of total revenue 
in  approximately of our customers each purchased over  of products  in aggregate representing approximately of total revenue 
total customers in decreased to approximately from over in vs 
revenue in was million compared to million in  a decrease of approximately 
the decrease in revenue was primarily attributed to purchases of million from one of our service provider customers in the first quarter of purchases from this customer were not significant during the remainder of and throughout from to  revenue from enterprise customers remained consistent while revenue from service provider customers declined 
during  sales of products for applications in the new network accounted for approximately of total revenue  as compared to of total revenue for in  domestic revenue decreased slightly while international revenue remained constant  at approximately million per year  representing an increase from of total revenue in to of total revenue in revenue from captaris accounted for of total revenue in compared to in in  approximately of our customers each purchased over  of products  in aggregate representing of total revenue 
in  approximately of our customers each purchased over  of products  in aggregate representing approximately of total revenue 
total customers in decreased to over from over  in cost of product sold and gross profit the following table presents cost of product sold and gross profit information years ended december  dollars in thousands cost of product sold    gross profit    gross profit percentage vs 
the decrease in cost of product sold from to was the result of a decrease in inventory obsolescence expense  changes in product mix  and direct material cost reductions from manufacturing subcontractors 
our inventory obsolescence expense decreased by million in  primarily due to reduced reserve requirements for service provider product inventory 
our change in product mix to higher margin products contributed to a significant improvement in the gross profit percentage in compared to vs 
the decrease in cost of product sold from to was primarily the result of a million decrease in inventory obsolescence expense  combined with direct material cost reductions achieved from using new manufacturing subcontractors 
the decrease in inventory obsolescence expense is primarily due to lower charges for obsolete service provider product inventory in these factors contributed to a slight improvement in gross profit in compared to operating expenses the following table presents our operating expenses years ended december  dollars in thousands research and development    selling  general and administrative    total operating expenses    research and development expenses vs 
research and development expense represented of revenue in  compared with of revenue in the million decrease in was primarily the result of reduced consulting and contract labor expenses  decreased spending on new product prototypes and decreased depreciation expense 
our continuing development efforts are focused on hardware and software for media processing products voice  fax and data  network interface products  call control products and signal processing products 
vs 
research and development expense represented of revenue in  compared with of revenue in the million decrease was primarily the result of reduced consulting  contract labor  and depreciation expense  offset partially by increases in spending on new product prototypes and equipment purchases 
selling  general and administrative expenses vs 
selling  general and administrative expense represented of total revenue in  compared with of total revenue in the million increase in selling  general and administrative expense from to was primarily due to increases in professional fees  sales and use taxes  and marketing expenses associated with the partner access network program 
these expense increases were partially offset by reduced compensation expense due to a decrease in our employee count and by lower depreciation expense 
vs 
the million decrease in selling  general and administrative expense from to was primarily due to a decrease in bad debt expense as a result of recoveries of previously written off accounts receivable balances  along with reduced spending for variable incentive compensation  travel and entertainment  and depreciation 
these expense decreases were partially offset by increases in marketing expenses associated with the partner access network program 
other income expense  net the following table presents our other income expense  net years ended december  dollars in thousands net gain loss on investments  equity in loss of affiliates  interest income  net and other  total other income expense  net   net gain loss on investments during  we had a gain on the sale of an investment of million from the sale of million shares of network engines  inc common stock acquired from the exercise of stock purchase warrants 
during  we had no gains or losses on investments 
during  we had a loss on investments of million 
of this total expense  million was due to a permanent reduction of the carrying value of the sonexis  inc preferred stock as a result of a decrease in the appraised value of these shares 
we received this preferred stock  along with cash  as consideration for the sale of brooktrout software in april in addition  we realized a loss of approximately million related to the sale of an equity investment in a privately held technology company that had been accounted for using the cost method 
equity in loss of affiliates we recorded equity in loss of affiliates of million in related to net losses of our equity investees  pelago networks  inc and telchemy  incorporated 
as of december   the investment in pelago had been written down to zero  and since we had no further funding commitment  we ceased recording our share of pelago s losses 
our interest in pelago was further reduced below following an equity financing by pelago during we did not recognize additional losses in or related to telchemy since we disposed of our equity interest in that business on december  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
we recorded no equity in losses of affiliates during and interest income  net and other the sequential decrease in interest income  net and other from to was the result of a decline in short term interest rates  which offset the favorable impact of steadily increasing cash and marketable debt securities balances 
income tax provision benefit the following table presents our income tax provision benefit and effective tax rate years ended december  dollars in thousands income tax provision benefit   effective tax rate vs 
in  we recorded an income tax provision as a result of our reporting a pre tax profit for the year 
the higher effective tax rate in was impacted both by a disproportionate effect of permanent differences as compared to pre tax profit and a limitation on the availability of our research and development tax credit  which resulted from our incurring a significantly lower level of qualified research and development expenses during as compared to prior years 
also in  we established a valuation allowance in the amount of million relating to anticipated capital losses on long term investments that are not expected to be realizable 
in  we increased the valuation allowance by 
million 
vs 
in both and  we recorded an income tax benefit  along with an income tax receivable  because we could carry back losses before income taxes for and to and  years in which we were profitable 
the reduction in the income tax benefit rate in relative to resulted from our recording of a valuation allowance related to long term investments in liquidity and capital resources cash flows for the years ended december    and cash flows from operating activities were million in this primarily resulted from tax refunds of million and reductions in inventory  both of which were partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable 
both the reductions in inventory and the increase in accounts receivable were attributable to our increased sales activity 
cash flows from operating activities were million in this primarily resulted from income tax refunds of million and reductions in inventory  both of which were partially offset by a decrease in current liabilities 
cash flows from operating activities were million in this primarily resulted from reductions in inventory  accounts receivable and net liabilities of discontinued operations 
cash used in investing activities was million in this primarily resulted from net purchases of marketable debt securities of million and our deposit for technology to be acquired of million 
cash used in investing activities was million in this primarily resulted from net purchases of marketable debt securities of million 
cash used in investing activities was million in this primarily resulted from net purchases of marketable debt securities of million and purchases of investments of million  both of which were partially offset by the million of proceeds from the sale of brooktrout software to sonexis in april cash from financing activities was million in this was primarily attributable to proceeds from the sale of common stock under our employee stock option plans and our employee stock purchase plan  as well as the repayment of officer notes receivable 
from time to time  the company receives shares of its common stock as payment for the exercise price of stock options which are then added to our treasury share balance 
cash from financing activities was million and million in and  respectively  all of which was attributable to proceeds from the sale of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
contractual obligations and capital expenditures the following table presents our future contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  total thereafter dollars in thousands operating leases    we have operating lease commitments for our primary office and manufacturing facilities that expire between and in addition  we lease office space for sales and support functions that expire beyond certain lease agreements require us to pay all of the building s taxes  insurance and maintenance costs 
we purchased million of capital equipment in  million in  and million in we currently have no material commitments for additional capital expenditures 
in  we made a million deposit for technology to be acquired in  and contingent upon satisfactory performance by the seller and our final acceptance  we will be obligated to purchase an additional million of purchased hardware and software assets and engineering services of million in we have certain inventory purchase commitments that are part of our ordinary course of business in which the product delivery dates range from one month to five months into the future 
we do not expect these short term commitments to have a material impact on our financial results 
we had no long term debt as of december  or march  cash and cash liquidity position the following table presents our cash and liquidity position as of december    and years ended december  dollars in thousands cash and cash equivalents    marketable debt securities    total    working capital    quick ratio maximum available line of credit    cash  cash equivalents and marketable debt securities increased to million as of december  from million as of december   primarily due to a million tax refund  net cash flows from other operating and investing activities of million  and cash proceeds from employee stock transactions of million in working capital increased by million from december  to december  this increase in working capital was the result of the increase in cash  cash equivalents  and marketable debt securities  partially offset by decreases in income taxes receivable and inventory 
our quick ratio improved from at december  to at december   due primarily to a increase in cash  cash equivalents  and marketable debt securities while current liabilities decreased modestly 
quick ratio is calculated as current assets minus inventory  income tax receivable and deferred tax assets divided by current liabilities  and is an indicator of a company s ability to meet short term financial obligations 
we have a million working capital line of credit available from a commercial bank 
any borrowings would bear interest at the lender s prime rate 
the line of credit is secured by a pledge of substantially all of our assets 
availability of funds under this line of credit is subject to compliance with certain financial covenants relating to our quick ratio  minimum tangible net worth  and other standard reporting requirements 
as of december   letters of credit issued against the existing line totaled million  representing the collateral required for certain lease obligations 
other than the issuance of letters of credit and the use of the credit line to secure immaterial foreign currency forward contracts  there have been no borrowings under the line during the past three years 
the line of credit expires on july  in october  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to  shares of our common stock from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions 
this program will be funded by our existing and future cash and marketable debt securities balances 
as of march   we had not repurchased any shares under the plan 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalents and marketable debt securities are likely to meet our needs for the foreseeable future 
though we do not expect to make any major capital expenditures in  we are always looking for opportunities to expand the business  which could include acquisitions or organic expansion into new markets 
if we find that our cash and cash equivalents  marketable debt securities and funds available from our bank line of credit are not sufficient  we may choose to utilize or to seek other sources of financing 
if we were to seek future equity financings  the terms may be dilutive to our stockholders and may contain restrictive covenants  which could limit our ability to pursue certain courses of action 
it is possible that  should the need arise  we will not be able to obtain additional financing  or that the financing made available to us will not be on acceptable terms 
the pricing of our products and the costs of our goods can be significantly affected by current market conditions 
market conditions can be impacted by inflation  however  we believe that inflation has not had a significant effect on our operations to date 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the staff of the sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  which superceded sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab rescinded accounting guidance contained in sab related to multiple element revenue arrangements  superceded as a result of the issuance of emerging issues task force eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
additionally  sab rescinded the sec s revenue recognition in financial statements frequently asked questions and answers faq issued with sab that had been codified in sec topic  revenue recognition 
selected portions of the faq have been incorporated into sab while the wording of sab has changed to reflect the issuance of eitf  the revenue recognition principles of sab remain largely unchanged by the issuance of sab the adoption of sab has not had a material impact on the company s operations or financial position 
factors that may affect future results the risks and uncertainties described below are those that we currently believe may materially affect us 
the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these factors 
you should also refer to the other information in this report  including the consolidated financial statements and related notes 
the risks and uncertainties described below are those that we currently believe may materially affect us 
additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of  or that we currently deem immaterial  also may become important factors that affect us 
risks related to our business downturns in the economy generally  and in sectors of the telecommunications industry in particular  make it difficult to anticipate or expand sales 
as a result of the uncertain economic conditions that have affected most technology sectors and the telecommunications sector in particular  over the past few years  many of our customers have aggressively sought to increase efficiency in their supply chains and reduce their inventory levels 
additionally  the slowdown in the telecommunications industry and the resulting decrease in spending by companies in our target markets have reduced the rate of growth of data traffic and the use of the internet  which are driving the convergence of data and telephony that we expect will give rise to demand for new network applications 
the economic downturn adversely affected our business and operating results for the year ended december   and even more so for the years ended december  and while we believe the economic condition may be improving somewhat  if current economic conditions do not improve as expected or if they worsen  we may experience additional adverse effects on our revenue  net income and cash flow 
for example  if the rate at which our customers order product decreases  it becomes more likely that our current inventories would be exposed to technological obsolescence  which would require us to reduce the value of those inventories on our balance sheet 
if we fail to compete successfully in the highly competitive telecommunications market  our revenue and profitability will suffer 
the market for telecommunications equipment is highly competitive 
if we are unable to differentiate our products from existing and future offerings of our competitors  and thereby effectively compete in the market for telecommunications equipment  our operating results could be materially adversely affected 
many of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater selling and marketing  technical  manufacturing  financial  and other resources 
we expect our current competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their existing products and to introduce new products and enhancements with improved price and performance characteristics 
our product sales may be threatened by new technologies  products or market trends  and we may have to reduce the prices of our products to stay competitive 
in addition  new competitors may emerge in the markets we serve 
an acquisition of  or by  one of our competitors may result in a substantially strengthened competitor with greater financial  engineering  manufacturing  marketing  and customer service and support resources than we have 
if our current or future competitors enter into strategic relationships with leading manufacturers covering products similar to those sold or being developed by us  our ability to sell products to those manufacturers may be adversely affected 
capitalizing on our technology will require a continued high level of investment in research and development  marketing  and customer service and support 
we may be unable  or otherwise fail  to allocate sufficient resources to achieve the technological advances necessary to compete successfully with existing competitors or new entrants 
internal development efforts by our customers may adversely affect demand for our products 
many of our customers  including the large oems on which we focus a significant portion of our sales and marketing efforts  have the technical and financial ability to design and produce components replicating or improving on the functionality of most of our products 
these customers often consider in house development of technologies and products as an alternative to doing business with us 
we cannot assure you that our existing or potential customers will do business with us  rather than attempting to develop similar technology and products internally or obtaining technology or products through acquisitions 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to find customers to replace the revenue lost as a result of customers developing technologies or products in house 
any such occurrence could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or operating results 
if we fail to develop and sell new or enhanced products for the telecommunications hardware and software market  we will not be able to compete effectively 
the telecommunications hardware and software market is characterized by rapid technological advances  evolving industry standards  changes in customer requirements and product life cycles  frequent new product introductions or innovations  declining prices  intense competition  and evolving offerings by telecommunications service providers 
our future success depends in large part on our ability to offer products that address the sophisticated and varied needs of our current and prospective customers and to respond to technological advances and evolving industry standards on a timely and cost effective basis 
the timely development of new or enhanced products is a complex and uncertain process 
we intend to continue to invest significantly in product and technology development 
we may experience design  manufacturing  marketing and other difficulties that could delay or prevent our development  introduction or commercialization of any new and enhanced products 
we may also not be able to incorporate new technologies on a cost effective or timely basis  which may result in unexpected expenses 
we may not anticipate technological or market trends accurately or manage long development cycles successfully 
we may be required to collaborate with third parties to develop products and may not be able to do so on a timely and cost effective basis  if at all 
the introduction of new or enhanced products also requires that we manage the transition from older products so as to minimize the disruption to customers and ensure that adequate supplies of new products can be delivered to meet anticipated customer demand 
if we are unable to develop new products or enhancements on a timely and cost effective basis  or if the new products or enhancements that we introduce fail to achieve market acceptance  our ability to grow our business would be harmed and competitors could achieve greater market share 
our revenue could decline significantly if we lose a major customer or if a major customer cancels  reduces or delays an order 
one customer accounted for of our revenue in the year ended december  and for of our revenue in the year ended december  the loss of this or any other major customer or the cancellation  reduction or delay of significant orders from such customers  even if only temporary  could significantly reduce our revenue and cash flow and could harm our reputation in the industry 
our dependence on sole and single source suppliers and independent manufacturers could result in increased costs or delays in the manufacture and delivery of our products 
although we generally use standard parts and components for our products  some key components are purchased from sole or single source vendors for which alternative sources are not currently available or are difficult to obtain 
our inability to obtain sufficient quantities of these components may result in future delays or reductions in product shipments that could cause us to lose sales  incur additional costs and suffer harm to our reputation 
we currently purchase proprietary components from a number of suppliers for which there are no direct substitutes 
these components could be replaced with alternatives from other suppliers  but that might require redesign of our products 
if such a redesign were required  we would incur considerable delay and expenses 
we currently enter into purchase orders with our suppliers for materials based on forecasts of need  but have no guaranteed supply arrangements with these suppliers 
in addition  we currently use independent manufacturers to manufacture printed circuit boards  chassis and subassemblies in accordance with our design and specification 
our reliance on independent manufacturers involves a number of risks  including the potential for inadequate capacity of  unavailability of  or interruptions in access to  process technologies  and reduced control over delivery schedules  manufacturing yields and costs 
if our manufacturers are unable or unwilling to continue manufacturing our components in required quantities or to our quality expectations  we will have to transfer manufacturing to acceptable alternative manufacturers that we have identified  which could result in significant delays in shipment of products to customers 
moreover  the manufacture of these components is extremely complex  and our reliance on the suppliers of these components exposes us to potential production difficulties and quality variations  which could negatively affect the cost and timely delivery of our products 
we currently enter into purchase orders with independent manufacturers of materials based on forecasts of need  but have no guaranteed capacity arrangements with these manufacturers 
any significant interruption in the supply  or degradation in the quality  of any component could cause us to lose sales  incur additional costs and suffer harm to our reputation 
defects in our products or problems arising from the use of our products may seriously harm our business and reputation 
products as complex as ours may contain known and undetected errors  bugs  or other performance problems 
defects are frequently found during the period immediately following introduction and initial implementation of new products or enhancements to existing products 
although it is our objective to resolve all bugs that we believe would be considered serious by our customers before implementation  our products may not be bug free 
we also provide warranties against defects in materials and workmanship on our hardware products for five years 
errors  bugs or performance problems  however  could result in lost revenue or customer relationships and could be detrimental to our business and reputation generally 
in addition  our customers generally use our products together with their own products and products from other vendors 
as a result  when problems occur  it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem 
these problems may cause us to incur significant warranty and repair costs  divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts and cause significant customer relations problems 
changes to regulations affecting the telecommunications or internet industries could reduce demand for our products or increase our costs 
laws and regulations governing telecommunications  electronic commerce and the internet are emerging  but remain largely unsettled  even in the areas where there has been some legislative action 
regulation may focus on  among other things  assessing access or settlement charges  or imposing tariffs or regulations based on the characteristics and quality of products  either of which could restrict our business or increase our cost of doing business 
any changes to existing laws or the adoption of new regulations by federal or state regulatory authorities or any legal challenges to existing laws or regulations relating to the telecommunications industry could materially adversely affect the market for our products 
moreover  our value added resellers or other customers may require  or we may otherwise deem it necessary or advisable  for us to alter our products to address actual or anticipated changes in the regulatory environment 
our inability to alter our products or address any regulatory changes could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or operating results 
limitations on our ability to adequately protect our proprietary rights may prevent us from retaining our competitive advantage and negatively affect our future operating results 
our success and ability to compete are dependent  in part  upon our proprietary technology 
taken as a whole  we believe our intellectual property rights are significant and any failure to adequately protect the unauthorized use of our proprietary rights could result in our competitors offering similar products  potentially resulting in loss of a competitive advantage and decreased revenue 
we rely upon a combination of patents  trademark law  trade secret protections  copyright law and confidentiality agreements with consultants and third parties to protect our proprietary rights 
notwithstanding our efforts  third parties may infringe or misappropriate our proprietary rights 
in addition  we generally require each of our employees to execute a proprietary information agreement designed to protect our trade secrets  our inventions created in the course of employment with us and other proprietary information of our company 
moreover  effective patent  trademark  copyright or trade secret protections may not be available in every country in which we operate or intend to operate to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
also  it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy or reverse engineer aspects of our products  develop similar technology independently or otherwise obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
furthermore  detecting unauthorized use of our proprietary rights is difficult 
litigation may be necessary to enforce our proprietary rights 
such litigation could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources and could have a material adverse effect on our future operating results 
intellectual property claims against us can be costly and negatively affect our business 
in the telecommunications business  there is frequent litigation based on allegations of patent infringement 
as the number of entrants in our market increases and the functionality of our products is enhanced and overlaps with the products of other companies  we may become subject to claims of infringement or misappropriation of the intellectual property rights of others 
as a result  from time to time  third parties may claim exclusive patent or other intellectual property rights to technologies that we use 
although we believe that we do not face material liability related to infringement of the intellectual property of others  any claims asserting that our products infringe or may infringe proprietary rights of third parties  if determined adversely to us  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or operating results 
any claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  divert the efforts of our engineering and management personnel  cause delays in product shipments or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements  any of which could have a material adverse effect upon our operating results 
in any legal action claiming patent infringement commenced against us  we cannot assure you that we would prevail in such litigation given the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in patent litigation 
in the event a claim against us was successful  and we could not obtain a license on acceptable terms or license a substitute technology or redesign to avoid infringement  we may be unable to market our affected products 
this could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
certain of our products depend upon the continued availability of licensed technology from third parties 
we currently license and will continue to license certain technology integral to certain of our products from third parties 
for example  we have obtained licenses from third parties for software for certain of our voice and fax products 
while we believe that much of this technology is available from multiple sources  any difficulties in acquiring third party technology licenses  or integrating the related third party technology into our products  could result in delays in product development or upgrades until equivalent technology can be identified  licensed and integrated 
we may require new licenses in the future as our business grows and technology evolves 
we cannot assure you that these licenses will continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms  if at all  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
if we are unable to attract or retain key personnel  we may be unable to operate our business successfully 
our success depends in large part upon the continued contributions of our key management  sales  marketing  and engineering personnel  many of whom perform important functions and would be difficult to replace 
if we lose one or more members of our senior management team our business and operating results would be harmed 
we do not have employment contracts with our key personnel 
there has been significant competition in our industry for qualified personnel  and  at times  we have experienced difficulty in recruiting qualified personnel 
we may not be able to attract and retain the necessary personnel to accomplish our business objectives  and we may experience constraints that will adversely affect our ability to satisfy customer demand in a timely fashion or to support our customers and operations 
our inability to hire qualified personnel on a timely basis  or to retain our key personnel  could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
we are subject to environmental and occupational health and safety regulations that can increase the costs of operations or limit our activities 
we are subject to environmental and occupational health and safety regulations relating to matters such as reductions in the use of harmful substances  comprehensive risk management in manufacturing activities and final products  the use of lead free soldering  and the recycling of products and packaging materials 
on february  the european parliament and the counsel of the european union published directives on waste electrical and electronic equipment and on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment 
these directives will generally require electronics producers after august to bear the cost of collection  treatment  recovery and safe disposal of past and future products from end users and to ensure after june that new electrical and electronic equipment does not contain specified hazardous substances 
while the cost of these directives to us cannot be determined before regulations are adopted in individual member states of the european union  it may be substantial and may divert resources  which could detract from our ability to develop new products 
we may not be able to comply in all cases with applicable environmental and other regulations  and if we do not  we may incur remediation costs or we may not be able to offer our products for sale in certain countries  which could adversely affect our results 
our products typically have long sales cycles  causing us to expend significant resources before recognizing revenue 
the length of our sales cycle typically ranges from six to eighteen months and varies substantially from customer to customer 
prospective customers generally must commit significant resources to test and evaluate our products and integrate them into larger systems 
this evaluation period is often prolonged due to delays associated with approval processes that typically accompany the design and testing of new communications equipment by our customers 
in addition  the rapidly emerging and evolving nature of the markets in which we and our customers compete may cause prospective customers to delay their purchase decisions as they evaluate new technologies and develop and implement new systems 
during the period in which our customers are evaluating whether to place an order with us  we often incur substantial sales and marketing expenses  without any assurance of future orders or their timing 
even after a customer places an order  the timing of the development  introduction and implementation of the customer s product or service using our product is controlled by  and can vary significantly with the needs of the customer 
in some circumstances  the customer will not require the product for several months 
this continuing uncertainty can complicate our planning processes and reduce the predictability of our earnings and cash flows 
our business and operating results could be adversely affected by downturns in economic conditions in countries outside the united states and other risks associated with international operations 
sales of our products to customers outside the united states accounted for of our revenue in the year ended december  we anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue 
because of our dependence upon international sales  we are subject to a number of risks  including volatility in currency exchange rates  political and economic instability in other countries  the imposition of trade restrictions  trade barriers  and tariff regulations by foreign governments  difficulties in accounts receivable collections  extended payment terms beyond those customarily offered in the united states  potentially adverse tax consequences  and difficulties in managing and or expanding operations across disparate geographic areas 
in addition  most countries require technical approvals from their telecommunications regulatory agencies for products that operate in conjunction with the local telephone system 
obtaining these approvals is generally a prerequisite for sales in a given jurisdiction 
obtaining requisite approvals takes from two months to a year or more depending on the product and the jurisdiction 
these or other factors may limit our ability to sell our products in other countries  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
we may seek to expand through acquisitions of complementary businesses  and we may not be able to successfully integrate acquired companies 
we may seek to acquire strategic complementary companies in the future 
in addition to the difficulties we may face in identifying and consummating acquisitions  we will also be required to integrate and consolidate any acquired businesses or assets with our existing operations 
managing an acquired business entails numerous operational and financial risks  including difficulties in integrating disparate administrative  accounting and finance  and information systems  difficulties in assimilating acquired operations and new personnel  diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  and potential loss of key employees or customers of any acquired operations 
accordingly  we may be unable to successfully identify  consummate and integrate future acquisitions or operate acquired businesses profitably 
if we are unable to integrate an acquired company successfully  our future growth may suffer  and our results of operations could be harmed 
risks related to our common stock our operating results could fluctuate significantly and cause our stock price to be volatile  which may cause the value of your investment to decline 
our operating results could fluctuate in the future due to a variety of factors  many of which are outside of our control 
if our operating results do not meet the expectations of securities analysts  the trading price of our common stock could significantly decline 
this may cause the value of your investment in our company to decline 
in addition  the value of your investment could be affected by investor perception of our industry or our prospects generally  independent of our operating performance 
some of the factors that could affect our operating results or the market price of our common stock include our ability to cope with difficult conditions in the economy in general  and the telecommunications market in particular  our ability to formulate and implement effective strategies to respond to changing market requirements and conditions  cancellation or rescheduling of orders for our products  our ability to collect accounts receivable from customers that have been adversely affected by the difficult economic conditions  our ability to develop  manufacture  market and support our products and product enhancements  the timing and number of orders for our products  which have historically been weighted more heavily toward the last month of each quarter and the second and fourth quarters of each year  we typically experience lower revenue in the third quarter  due to customer summer vacation schedules  particularly in europe  and to a lesser extent  the first quarter of each year  our ability to hire  train and retain key management  sales  marketing and engineering personnel  announcements or technological innovations by our competitors or in competing technologies  our ability to obtain sufficient supplies of sole or limited source components for our products  a decrease in the average selling prices of our products  changes in costs of components that we include in our products  the mix of products that we sell  any interruptions in the flow of our products through our resellers or our two tiered distribution system  and a decrease in the demand for our common stock 
due to these and other factors  revenue  expenses and operating results could vary significantly in the future  and period to period comparisons should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
the market price of our common stock may be volatile  which could lead to losses for individual investors 
stock markets in general  and the market for technology stocks  including our common stock  in particular  have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated  or disproportionate  to the operating performance of those companies 
the market for our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be volatile 
many factors could cause the trading price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially  including the following future announcements concerning our business  technology  acquisitions  strategic partnerships  management  customers or competitors  introduction of new products or changes in product pricing policies by us  our competitors or our customers  changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts or announcements of results of operations that are not aligned with the expectations of analysts and investors  changes in market valuations of similar companies  reduced spending for telecommunications hardware and software  the economic and competitive conditions in the telecommunications sectors in which our customers operate  and general economic conditions and stock market trends 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company 
many technology companies have been subject to this type of litigation 
this type of litigation  if instituted against us  could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management s attention and resources 
our corporate documents may prevent a change in control or management that stockholders consider desirable 
our charter and by laws contain provisions that might enable our management to resist a takeover of our company 
in addition  our board of directors has adopted a shareholder rights plan 
these provisions and our shareholder rights plan could have the effect of delaying  deferring  or preventing a change in control of brooktrout or a change in our management that stockholders consider favorable or beneficial 
they could discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions 
they also could limit the price that investors may be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
we may need additional financing in the future  and any additional financing may result in restrictions on our operations or substantial dilution to our stockholders 
we may need to raise additional funds in the future  for example  to develop new technologies  support our expansion  respond to competitive pressures  acquire complementary businesses or respond to unanticipated situations 
we may decide to raise additional funds through public or private financings  strategic relationships or other arrangements 
our ability to obtain debt or equity funding will depend on a number of factors  including market conditions  our operating performance and investor interest 
additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to revise our business plan to reduce expenditures  including curtailing our growth strategies  foregoing acquisitions or reducing our product development efforts 
if we succeed in raising additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible securities  the issuance could result in substantial dilution to existing stockholders 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of debt securities or preferred stock  these new securities would have rights  preferences and privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock 
the terms of these securities  as well as any borrowings under our bank line of credit agreement  could impose restrictions on our operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest cash balances in excess of operating requirements in short term securities  generally with maturities of days or less on the date of purchase 
these securities consist of us government notes and bonds  commercial paper  and certificates of deposit 
we invest in marketable debt securities that consist of notes and bonds of various federal agencies  as well as corporate commercial paper  with maturities greater than days on the date of purchase 
if we were to experience a increase in the effective interest rate  the effect on the carrying value of marketable debt securities would be a decrease of  our securities are considered available for sale for accounting purposes and any unrealized gain or loss is deferred as a component of other comprehensive income loss 
in addition  our working capital line of credit provides for borrowings that bear interest at a variable rate equal to the lender s prime rate 
as of december   we did not have any borrowings outstanding under this line of credit and we were not exposed to market risk 
other than the issuance of letters of credit and using the credit line to secure immaterial foreign currency forward contracts  there have been no borrowings under the line during the past three years 
the line of credit expires on july  we anticipate that the line of credit will be renewed on substantially the same terms as the existing line of credit 
we believe that the effects  if any  of possible near term changes in interest rates on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows will not be material 
we generally conduct business denominated in us dollars 
we do  however  operate facilities overseas and we therefore also conduct some business in other currencies 
the impact of changes in currency rates on our consolidated results of operations has not been significant in any period presented 
substantially all of our revenue is denominated in us dollars  as are the significant majority of our expenses 
we manage our exposure to foreign currency market risks through regular operating and financing activities  and through the use of foreign currency forward exchange contracts 
as of december   a appreciation or depreciation in foreign currency exchange rates from the prevailing market rates would have had an immaterial impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows  due to the relatively immaterial number of transactions occurring in currencies other than the us dollar
