item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview during  ferro completed the integration of dmc  acquired in september  to significantly reposition the company s portfolio toward higher growth businesses  solidify its leading market position in core businesses and further geographic diversity 
the company is positioned in to fully realize these benefits and the synergies from integrating the dmc businesses  including the elimination of duplicate facilities  reduced overhead and raw material sourcing leverage 
net income for the year declined to million from million in due primarily to the million gain on the sale of the powder coatings business in  higher raw material costs and the impact of reduced volumes in certain markets 
with the weak conditions throughout most of the markets that ferro served during  all of the company s businesses have continued to concentrate on lowering working capital  reducing costs and maximizing cash flow generation 
as a result  the company generated cash flow from continuing operations of million which enabled a further reduction in total debt  including off balance sheet borrowing  of million 
going forward into  the company will continue to focus on aggressive cost containment measures  strengthening the balance sheet and closely managing working capital 
major emphasis will also be placed on the organic growth of our electronic material systems and pharmaceuticals and fine chemicals businesses and on accelerating growth in the asia pacific region  especially in china 
the company expects that certain costs  including raw materials  wages and benefits will increase in  offsetting  in part  the benefits of cost reduction efforts 
factors that could adversely affect the company s future financial performance are contained within risk factors included herein under item in september  the company completed the sale of its powder coatings business unit and in june  the company completed the sale of its petroleum additives and specialty ceramics business units  and accordingly for all periods presented  each of these businesses has been reported as a discontinued operation 
outlook the fourth quarter showed promising signs of economic recovery in north america and demand for our key end markets in the asia pacific region remained robust 
while we expect this trend to continue into  the weakness of the european economy remains a concern 
a recovery in our european end market demand will likely lag a recovery in north america 
the company will be challenged in the short term by increasing oil based raw material costs and costs for other commodities like cobalt  nickel and zircon which will be offset by price increases where appropriate and increased volumes for most of our product lines and cost savings from actions taken in 
table of contents coatings segment 
for tile coatings  the european economic environment and the strong euro have been a challenge during production facilities were consolidated in italy and several other cost reduction initiatives were completed during the year 
the consolidation and productivity gains achieved in  combined with modest demand growth over the next several quarters in and continued cost reduction through lean manufacturing initiatives  should support significant operating margin improvement going forward for tile coatings 
the month of december  provided the strongest sales month of the year for electronic materials  which should continue to benefit from the global rebound in the electronics end markets 
we expect electronic materials sales to grow at the pace of semiconductor build rates for the foreseeable future 
performance chemicals segment 
polymer additives has been faced with a decline in demand  pricing pressure due to industry wide over capacity  and rising raw materials costs during during the fourth quarter of  the pvc industry posted a modest recovery from its mid year low point 
also  while raw material prices remain high  price increases were successfully implemented to offset some of the margin impact 
significant cost reductions have been completed and discretionary spending has been restricted in polymer additives and further emphasis has been placed on reducing working capital for specialty plastics  demand improved in the fourth quarter of for the key north american end markets consumer packaging  appliances and automotive 
demand for plastic products in europe continued to lag  partially offsetting the improved demand in north america 
as the company moves into  increasing oil prices may result in further raw material cost increases for specialty plastics  however  improving market conditions should allow for higher product pricing to help offset the higher costs 
pharmaceuticals and fine chemicals realized double digit growth in revenue and profits in compared to the fourth quarter and full year of significant progress has been made in implementing the value added niche strategy for this business  which has expanded the opportunities for growth 
summary 
overall  we are optimistic given the trends we are seeing  but there is still uncertainty surrounding the impact of the strong euro and increasing oil prices 
in addition  some of the geo political events that have negatively impacted the economy in the recent past remain unresolved 
the company expects to meet its liquidity requirements for debt service  working capital  capital investments  post retirement obligations and dividends during from a variety of sources  including cash flow from operations and use of its credit facilities 
the company has a million revolving credit facility  of which million was available as of december   and accounts receivable securitization facility under which the company may receive advances of up to million  subject to the level of qualifying accounts receivable

results of operations comparison of the years ended december  and sales from continuing operations for the year ended december   of  million were higher than the  million of sales for the comparable period 
the impact of strengthening currencies  in particular the euro  improved revenue by during the year ended december  higher volumes in the asia pacific region and north america also contributed to the sales increase for the year but were partially offset by lower volumes in europe stemming from continued economic weakness 
gross margin from continuing operations were of sales compared with for the prior year period 
the reduced gross margins compared with the prior year stemmed from raw material cost increases in the performance chemicals segment only partially recovered through price adjustments and lower operating rates for the coatings segment in europe 

table of contents selling  administrative and general expenses from continuing operations were million for the year ended december   compared with million for the same period in the million increase in selling  administrative and general expenses was caused by the impact of the stronger euro against the dollar of million  increased integration and restructuring costs of million and higher pension expense

diluted earnings per share from discontinued operations totaled for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  net income for the year ended december  totaled million compared with net income of million for the year ended december  the decline was primarily due to million in lower contribution from discontinued operations  including the million gain from the sale of powder coatings  raw

diluted earnings per share were for the year ended december  versus diluted earnings of for the year ended december  coatings segment results 
sales in the coatings segment were  million for the year ended december   compared with sales of million for the year ended december  the increase of in sales is primarily due to the effect of currency exchange rates and increased end market demand for electronics 
operating income for the segment was million for the year ended december   compared with operating income of million for the year ended december  the decrease in segment income reflects lower volumes related to key european end markets for color and glass  tile coatings and porcelain enamel 
this was partially offset by cost saving actions taken throughout the year and increased volume in the electronics industry 
performance chemicals segment results 
sales in the performance chemicals segment were million for the year ended december   compared with sales of million for the year ended december  the year over year increase in sales was primarily due to the effect of currency exchange rates  higher prices and improved sales for pharmaceuticals and fine chemicals which more than offset the impact of lower demand for durable goods in the building and renovation end markets

 and other cost reduction initiatives 
charges for cost reduction and integration programs increased selling  general and administrative expenses by million and million during and  respectively

capital expenditures were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the company expects to be able to meet its liquidity requirements from a variety of sources  including cash flow from operations and use of its credit facilities 
the company has a million revolving credit facility  of which million was available as of december  see further information regarding the company s credit facilities included in note to the company s consolidated financial statements under item herein 
the company also has an accounts receivable securitization facility under which the company may receive advances of up to million  subject to the level of qualifying accounts receivable 
off balance sheet financing 
in  the company initiated a million five year program to sell securitize  on an ongoing basis  a pool of its trade accounts receivable 
this program serves to accelerate cash collections of the company s trade accounts receivable at favorable financing costs and supplements the company s liquidity requirements 
the decrease in the amounts outstanding during has reduced the programs importance for liquidity and capital resources 
under this program  certain of the receivables of the company are sold to a wholly owned unconsolidated qualified special purpose entity  ferro finance corporation ffc 
ffc can sell  under certain conditions  an undivided fractional ownership interest in the pool of receivables to a multi seller receivables securitization company conduit 
additionally  under this program  receivables of certain european subsidiaries are sold directly to other conduits 
at december   million had been advanced to the company  net of repayments  under this program 
during the twelve months ended december    million of accounts receivable were sold under this program and  million of receivables were collected and remitted to the conduits  resulting in a net reduction in borrowings of million and total advances outstanding at december  of million 
the company and certain european subsidiaries on behalf of ffc and the conduits provide service  administration and collection of the receivables 
ffc and the conduits have no recourse to the company s other assets for failure of debtors to pay when due 
under fasb statement no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities a replacement of fasb statement no 
 neither the amounts advanced nor the corresponding receivables sold are reflected in the company s consolidated 
table of contents balance sheet 
the accounts receivable securitization facility contains a provision under which the agent can terminate the facility if the company s senior credit rating is downgraded below bb by standard poor s rating group s p or ba by moody s investor service  inc moody s 
see discussion under revolving credit facility about factors considered by the ratings agencies when evaluating a change in the rating 
the company at december  had a senior credit rating of bbb by s p and baa by moody s 
ferro does not believe that the termination of this facility would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the company s liquidity or the company s capital resource requirements 
the termination of this program at december   would have reduced the company s liquidity to the extent that the total program of million exceeded advances outstanding of million 
the liquidity from the company s revolving credit facility of million under which million was available at december   and the available cash flows from operations  should allow the company to meet its funding requirements and other commitments if this program was terminated 
the company retains interest in the receivables transferred to ffc and conduits in the form of a note receivable to the extent that receivables transferred exceed advances 
the note receivable balance was million as of december   and million as of december  the company and certain european subsidiaries  on a monthly basis  measure the fair value of the retained interests at management s best estimate of the undiscounted expected future cash collections on the transferred receivables 
actual cash collections may differ from these estimates and would directly affect the fair value of the retained interests 
in june  the company bought out its million leveraged lease program under which the company leased certain land  buildings  machinery and equipment 
the assets had an appraised value of million which was recorded on the balance sheet 
a loss of million was recognized in cost of sales in as a result of the buyout 
the program had been accounted for as an operating lease 
revolving credit facility 
obligations under the revolving credit facility are unsecured  however  if the company s senior credit rating is downgraded below ba by moody s or bb by s p  the company and its material subsidiaries would be required to grant security interests in its principal manufacturing properties  pledge of the stock of material domestic subsidiaries and pledge of the stock of material foreign subsidiaries  in each case  in favor of the company s lenders under the facility 
in that event  liens on principal domestic manufacturing properties and the stock of domestic subsidiaries would be shared with the holders of the company s senior notes and debentures and trust notes and trust certificates issued under a leveraged lease program 
the rating agencies may  at any time  based on various factors including changing market  political or socio economic conditions  reconsider the current rating of the company s outstanding debt 
based on rating agency disclosures  ferro understands that ratings changes within the general industrial sector are evaluated based on quantitative  qualitative and legal analyses 
factors considered by the rating agencies include industry characteristics  competitive position  management  financial policy  profitability  capital structure  cash flow production and financial flexibility 
s p and moody s have disclosed that the company s ability to improve earnings  reduce the company s level of indebtedness and strengthen cash flow protection measures  whether through asset sales  increased free cash flows from acquisitions or otherwise  will be factors in their ratings determinations going forward 
the company s credit facility contains customary operating covenants that limit its ability to engage in certain activities  including significant acquisitions 
see further information regarding these covenants in note to the company s consolidated financial statements under item herein 
the company s ability to meet these covenants in the future may be affected by events beyond its control  including prevailing economic  financial and market conditions and their effect on the company s financial position and results of operations 
the company does have several options available to mitigate these circumstances  including selected asset sales and the issuance of additional capital 
in september   the company renegotiated these financial covenants to provide greater flexibility to restructure and make acquisitions and to strengthen the company s liquidity profile 
the company enters into precious metal leases primarily gold  silver  platinum and palladium  which are arrangements under which banks provide the company with precious metals for a specified period for which the company pays a lease fee 
the lease terms are generally less than one year  and the company maintains sufficient quantities of precious metals to cover the lease obligations at all times 
the leases are treated as operating leases  and lease expenses were approximately million for the year ended december  as of december   the fair value of precious metals under leasing arrangements was million 
management believes it will continue to have sufficient availability under these leasing arrangements so that it will not be required to purchase or find alternative leasing or sourcing arrangements for its precious metal inventory requirements 
however  factors beyond the control of the company including prevailing economic  financial and market conditions and their effect 
table of contents on the company s financial position and results of operations  or those that management currently believes are unlikely  such as the termination of the company s revolving credit facility  could result in non renewal of the leases 
this would impact the liquidity of the company to the extent of the fair value of the precious metals leased 
ferro s level of debt and debt service requirements could have important consequences to its business operations and uses of cash flow 
in addition  a reduction in overall demand for the company s products could adversely affect cash flows from operations 
however  the company has a million revolving credit facility of which approximately million was available as of december  this liquidity  along with the liquidity from the company s asset securitization program of which was available as of december   and available cash flows from operations  should allow the company to meet its funding requirements and other commitments 
the company s aggregate amount of obligations for the next five years and thereafter is set forth below dollars in thousands thereafter totals principal repayments of long term debt revolving credit facility obligations under non cancelable operating leases accounts receivable securitization facility purchase obligations supplemental retirement plan obligations post retirement obligations pension funding pension funding includes projected contributions for the six largest global defined benefit plans for years through amounts included for pension funding in the united states are the erisa minimum qualified pension plan contributions assuming the extension of funding relief by congress 
pension funding subsequent to reflects the total projected benefit obligation less the fair value of plan assets and the funding contributions for the years through total pension expense  excluding supplemental plans  was million in compared with million in the increase was primarily due to a million increase in net amortization and deferral costs along with a net curtailment effect of million and million in higher interest costs in contributions to the plans increased to million in  of which million were made in cash and million in ferro corporation stock  from million in  all which were made in cash 
the unrecognized losses related to the plans were million at december   up from million at december  the weighted average discount rate was and the weighted average expected return on plan assets was as of december  pension expense  excluding supplemental plans  for is expected to increase to million and pension contributions are expected to decrease to million 
a increase in the actual return on plan assets would decrease the unrecognized plan losses at the end of the year by million 
a decrease in the actual return on plan assets would increase the unrecognized plan losses at the end of the year by million 
the amount of any increase decrease in unrecognized plan losses would eventually be recognized in the company s pension expense in future years 
the company does not believe that the current funding status of the plan will cause significant business  liquidity or capital funding issues

r  to clarify some of the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
of the same name interpretation no 
and to exempt certain entities from its requirements 
interpretation no 
addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities and requires existing unconsolidated variable interest entities to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries if the entities do not effectively disperse risk among parties involved 
it is based on the concept that companies that control another entity through interests other than voting interests should consolidate the controlled entity

as of october  the adoption of interpretation no 
did not have a material impact on the results of operations or financial position of the company 
in june  the company bought out its asset defeasance program that would have required consolidation on adoption of interpretation no 

table of contents critical accounting policies the company has identified the critical accounting policies that are most important to the portrayal of its financial condition and results of operations 
the policies set forth below require management s most subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
litigation and environmental reserves the company is involved in litigation in the ordinary course of business  including personal injury  property damage and environmental matters 
the company also expends funds for environmental remediations for both company owned and third party locations 
in accordance with fasb statement no 
accounting for contingencies  and statement of position  environmental remediation liabilities  the company records a loss and establishes a reserve for litigation or remediation when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability exists and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
reasonable estimates involve judgments made by management after considering a broad range of information including notifications  demand or settlements which have been received from a regulatory authority or private party  settlement of similar claims or third parties  estimates performed by independent engineering companies and outside counsel  available facts  existing and proposed technology  the identification of other potentially responsible parties and their ability to contribute and prior experience 
these judgments are reviewed quarterly as more information is received and the amounts reserved are updated as necessary 
however  the reserves may materially differ from ultimate actual liabilities if management s judgments regarding litigation settlements or environmental remediation are ultimately inaccurate 
income taxes deferred income taxes are provided to recognize the effect of temporary differences between financial and tax reporting 
deferred income taxes are not provided for undistributed earnings of foreign consolidated subsidiaries  to the extent such earnings are reinvested for an indefinite period of time 
the company has significant operations outside the united states  where substantial pre tax earnings are derived  and in jurisdictions where the statutory tax rate is lower than in the united states 
the company also has significant cash requirements in the united states to pay interest and principal on borrowings 
as a result  significant tax and treasury planning and analysis of future operations are necessary to determine the proper amount of tax assets  liabilities and tax expense 
the company s tax assets  liabilities and tax expense are supported by its best estimates and assumptions of its global cash requirements  planned dividend repatriations and expectations of future earnings 
however  the amounts recorded may materially differ from the amounts that are ultimately payable if management s estimates of future earnings and cash flow are ultimately inaccurate 
pension and other employee benefits certain assumptions are used in the calculation of the actuarial valuations of the company sponsored defined benefit pension and post retirement benefit plans 
these assumptions include the weighted average discount rate  rates of increase in compensation levels  expected long term rates of return on assets and increases or trends in health care costs 
if actual results are less favorable than those projected by management  lower levels of benefit credit or other additional expenses may be required  however  if actual results are more favorable than those projected by management  higher levels of benefit credit or lower levels of expense may result 
a increase in the actual return on plan assets would decrease the unrecognized plan losses at the end of the year by million 
a 
table of contents decrease in the actual return on plan assets would increase the unrecognized plan losses at the end of the year by million 
the amount of any increase decrease in unrecognized plan losses would eventually be recognized in the company s pension expense over five years 
inventory the company periodically evaluates its inventory valuation based upon the age of the inventory and assumptions of future demand and market conditions 
as a result of the evaluation  the inventory may be written down to the lower of cost or realizable value 
if actual valuations are less favorable than those projected by management  additional write downs may be required 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company provides for uncollectible accounts receivable based upon estimates of unrealizable amounts due from specific customers 
these estimates are based upon analysis of account agings and the financial condition of the customers 
if the actual future cash collections are less favorable than those projected by management  additional allowances for doubtful accounts could be required  however  if actual future cash collections are more favorable than those projected by management  established allowances for doubtful accounts could prove to be unnecessary  and would be released into income 
if it is determined  based on the company s assessment  that it is unlikely that a customer will be able to pay  the accounts receivable is charged off 
restructuring and cost reduction programs in july  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
statement no 
applies to costs from activities such as eliminating or reducing product lines  terminating employees and contracts  and relocating plant facilities or personnel 
the company adopted fasb statement no 
as of january   and accordingly  records exit or disposal costs when they are incurred and can be measured at fair value 
the adoption of fasb statement no 
did not have an impact on the financial statements because the company recorded restructuring and integration charges as summarized in note of the consolidated company s financial statements using the guidance under fasb statement no 
 employers accounting for settlements and curtailments of defined benefit pension plans and for termination benefits and fasb statement no 
 employers accounting for postemployment benefits 
the company continued actions during associated with its cost reduction and integration programs 
the programs affect all businesses across the company  and generally will take no longer than twelve months to complete from the date of commencement unless certain legal or contractual restrictions on the company s ability to complete the program exist 
the company recorded million of charges during  which included million of severance benefits for employees affected by plant closings or capacity reduction  as well as various personnel in corporate  administrative or shared service functions 
termination benefits were based on various factors including length of service  contract provisions  local legal requirements and salary levels 
management estimated the charges based on these factors as well as projected final service dates 
certain changes in the original estimates may occur causing the company to adjust the amounts reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet indebtedness in  the company initiated a million five year program to sell securitize  on an ongoing basis  a pool of its trade accounts receivable 
this program serves to accelerate cash collections of the company s trade accounts receivable at favorable financing costs 
under the program  certain of the receivables of the company are sold to a wholly owned unconsolidated special purpose entity  ferro finance corporation ffc 
ffc can sell  under certain conditions  an undivided fractional ownership interest in the pool of receivables to a multi seller receivables securitization company conduit 
additionally  under this program  receivables of certain european subsidiaries are sold directly to other conduits 
the company and certain european subsidiaries on behalf of ffc and the conduits provide service  administration and collection of the receivables 
ffc and the conduits have no recourse to the company s other assets for failure of debtors to pay when due  and in accordance with fasb statement no 
accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  no liability is reflected on the company s balance sheet 
the company retains interests in the receivables transferred to ffc and conduits in the form of a note receivable to the extent that receivables transferred exceed advances 
the note receivable balance is included in other current assets in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
the company and certain european subsidiaries on a monthly basis measure the fair value of the retained interests at management s best estimate of the undiscounted 
table of contents expected future cash collections on the transferred receivables 
actual cash collections may differ from these estimates and would directly affect the fair value of the retained interests causing the company to adjust the amounts reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
valuation of long lived assets the company s long lived assets include property  plant  equipment  goodwill and other intangible assets 
property  plant and equipment are depreciated on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives 
the company adopted fasb statement no 
goodwill and other intangible assets statement no 
for goodwill and intangible assets acquired after june  as of july  statement no 
was adopted in its entirety as of january  and accordingly  the company s goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are no longer being amortized 
goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite useful lives are subject to periodic impairment testing  on at least an annual basis  to determine if their carrying value exceeds fair value 
fair value is estimated using the discounted cash flow method and impairment loss is recognized for the excess of the carrying value over its implied fair value 
other identifiable intangibles include patents  trademarks  customer lists  and other items 
intangible assets with finite lives are amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
the company tested its intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairments under the provisions of statement no 
and determined that during  no impairment had occurred
