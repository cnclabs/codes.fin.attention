results of operations overview we provide base stations and other wireless telecommunications infrastructure products designed to support the gsm system of mobile voice and data transmission 
we have substantial intellectual experience in the wireless industry and products and market our products worldwide to operators of wireless networks 
a base station is a key component of a wireless network and is used to receive and transmit voice and data signals over radio frequencies 
our products include the adaptacell base station  a software defined base station  meaning it uses software to control the way it encodes and decodes voice and data wireless signals  and the airsite backhaul free base station  which carries voice and data signals back to the wireline network without using a physical communications link 
these products are continually evolving 
for example  our product line now also includes our adaptive array supercapacity base station  using adaptive array technology to focus radio signals on individual handset antennas instead of spreading signals over the entire cell covered by one base station  and our rapidcell base station  a miniaturized version of our adaptacell base station configured for rapid deployment for use by emergency first responders or the military 
from our inception in january through may  our operations consisted principally of start up activity associated with the design  development  and marketing of our products 
we did not generate significant revenues until and have generated only million in net revenues from our inception through december  we have incurred substantial losses since commencing operations  and as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we have not achieved profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
as we continue to build our customer and revenue base we expect to continue to incur net losses at least through we will need to generate significantly higher revenues in order to support research and development  sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses  and to achieve and maintain profitability 
see liquidity  capital resources  and going concern below 
we began marketing our gsm base stations in the beginning of and shipped our first gsm base station in may through december   our base stations were being used in twenty five deployed systems 
we currently sell and market our products in the us through our direct sales force 
internationally  we sell our products through our direct sales force  as well as through agents and oems 
our revenues are derived 
table of contents from sales of a product line based on the gsm standard 
we generate a substantial portion of our revenues from a limited number of customers  with three customers accounting for of our net revenues during the fiscal year ended december  for the fiscal years ended december    and  our revenue from direct sales to international customers was   and  respectively 
in addition  revenue from oem sales for international deployments were  and for the years ended december    and  respectively 
during  we experienced a significant period of transition 
in mid  management undertook a strategic review of the business and established the following objectives for the future simplify the business  reduce the cost structure and move towards the path to long term sustainable profitability 
in connection with these objectives  we took action during the second  third  and fourth quarters to reduce costs and discretionary expenditures  negotiated settlements with vendors on existing accounts payable balances  undertook efforts to better leverage our technology base and entrepreneurial culture to target new market opportunities  and redirected our activities to focus in the following interrelated areas the growing market for secure  adaptable wireless infrastructure for governmental and public safety applications  our adaptive array technology for our adaptacell supercapacity base station  and our traditional gsm infrastructure market 
while market demand continues to be uncertain  we believe our strategy and new direction offer the most stable and attractive opportunities for us 
these four areas are interrelated and address the same basic market  that is  the wireless infrastructure market 
we have had and expect to continue to experience  significant fluctuations in our quarterly revenues as a result of our long and variable sales cycle 
historically  our sales cycle  which is the period from the time a sales lead is generated until the recognition of revenue  has ranged up to eighteen months in time 
the length and variability of our sales cycle is influenced by a number of factors beyond our control  including our customers build out and deployment schedules  our customers access to product purchase financing  our customers degree of familiarity with our products  the need for functional demonstrations and field trials  the manufacturing lead time for our products  delays in final acceptance of products following shipments  regulatory developments  and our revenue recognition policies 
the effect of our potentially long sales cycle on our results is compounded by our current dependence on a small number of customers 
in general  our gross margins will be affected by the following factors demand for our products and services  new product introductions  both by airnet and our competitors  changes in our pricing policies and those of our competitors  the mix of base stations and other products sold  the mix of sales channels through which our products and services are sold  engineering cost reduction successes  access to the best vendors from a cost and technology viewpoint  the mix of domestic and international sales  and the volume pricing we are able to obtain from contract manufacturers and third party vendors 
we currently obtain all of our primary components and subassemblies for our products from a limited number of independent contract manufacturers and purchase circuit boards  electronic and mechanical parts and other component assemblies from a limited number of oems and other selected vendors 
accordingly  a significant portion of our cost of revenues consists of payments to these suppliers 
the remainder of our cost of revenues is related to our in house manufacturing operations  which consist primarily of quality control  procurement and material management  final assembly  testing  and product integration 
research and development expenses consist primarily of expenses incurred in the design  development and support of our proprietary technology 
we expect research and development expenses to increase in as we further the development of our core technology 
research and development associated with future products will depend on customer requirements 
we may  however  incur costs in connection with the development of the 
table of contents software needed to upgrade our base stations to support emerging wireless high speed data transmission standards 
the cost incurred for software development performed by third parties through development agreements are carried on the balance sheet as an intangible asset until the product is deployed 
subsequent to deployment the cost is amortized over the life of the product 
as of december  one of the two products that were being capitalized is being marketed and the amortization began in the fourth quarter of sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions  consulting fees  trade show expenses  advertising  marketing expenses and general support costs 
we intend to maintain expenditures for selling and marketing in order to support distribution channels  strategic relationships  sales and marketing personnel  a x customer service center  rf services  field service support  and marketing programs 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of expenses for finance  office operations  administrative and general management activities  including legal  accounting  human resources  and other professional fees and loss provisions for uncollectable receivables 
related party transactions see item regarding a description of related party transactions during contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years operating lease obligations capital lease obligations other purchase obligations and commitments long term debt obligations total includes purchase obligations that are not recorded as liabilities on our balance sheet as we have not yet received the material or taken title to the property 
also includes commitments remaining on our edge software licensing agreement as described in note to the financial statements 
includes accrued interest on the bridge loan of  through its maturity date of august  and accrued interest on installments received on the securities purchase agreement note through january  certain remaining obligations under our agreement with arraycomm see note to the financial statements are not included above as they are contingent upon the shipment of supercapacity base stations  which cannot be defined at this point 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we have two off balance sheet arrangements 
the first is the tax benefit of our accumulated net operating losses see note to the financial statements for a full description 
the second is an advanced payment agreement with a customer 
we do not book this advanced payment until payment is received and then it is booked as a customer deposit 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenues net revenues decreased million or from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this decrease was largely attributed to completion of a project in central asia  which accounted for million of the revenue and a project in africa  which accounted for million of the revenue for the year ended december  compared to million and million  respectively for the year ended december  the million reduction in revenue associated with these two projects was partially offset by a million increase in customer funded development revenue 
during revenue trends were mixed 
domestic hardware revenues were down  
table of contents customer funded development and services revenue trended up and international revenues trended down primarily because of the completion of the central asia project 
we recognize the need for revenue growth to obtain profitability and sustain positive cash flow from operations 
through a series of expense reduction efforts and product cost initiatives  we estimate that we can be cash flow positive from operations with revenue of approximately million per quarter based on the margin rate 
to address the need for revenue growth  our selling strategy shifted in from a direct sales strategy to relying primarily on oems and agents to sell and distribute our products 
to this end  we signed oem agreements with three new oems during these new oems include a big five communications equipment provider  a major defense contractor and a middle east oem 
with a direct sales and marketing staff of five  oem and agent revenue are critical to our survival 
gross profit gross profit decreased million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the gross profit margin was for and for the increase in the gross profit margin was primarily attributable to a shift in the composition of business to more service and customer funded development revenues 
based upon our estimated view that the telecommunications market will experience a turnaround in the future  our improved product mix  successful implementation of cost reductions  and the refocus of our sales efforts toward the supercapacity adaptacell and rapidcell base stations  we believe our gross margin percentage will be flat to improved in the second half of if revenue levels meet projections 
however  future market conditions and economic conditions could affect the achievement of this objective 
cost of goods sold also includes approximately  of non cash stock compensation expense 
research and development research and development expenses decreased million or from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this decrease was due primarily to million of research and development resources being redirected to work on direct cost of sales activities 
in addition there was a decrease in labor of million including benefits  bonus accrual of million  use of outside services of million and a decrease in other departmental activities of million 
the expenses included million of non cash stock compensation expense in compared with in we began recruiting efforts to increase the size of the engineering organization in the fourth quarter of we are expecting research and development costs to trend upward in for two reasons the current efforts to increase engineering headcount and the research and development portion of non cash stock compensation expense is expected to increase from million in to approximately million in sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses decreased million or from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the million reduction included million of labor that was redirected to work on direct cost of sales activities  a million reduction in labor and benefit costs  a million reduction in travel expenses and million reduction in demonstration equipment 
the expenses for the year ended december  included million of non cash stock compensation expense in compared with in we are expecting sales and marketing costs to trend upward in for two reasons increased revenue should result in increased sales commissions and the sales and marketing related portion of non cash stock compensation expense is expected to increase from million in to approximately million in general and administrative general and administrative expenses increased million or from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the million increase in expenses was primarily attributable to non cash compensation expense of million recognized for the year ended december  compared to in also  reflected a million reduction in expenses due to the recovery of receivables previously accounted for in the provision for doubtful accounts 
these expenses were partially offset by reductions in other areas 
we believe that general and administrative expenses will increase in as the general and administrative portion of non cash stock compensation expense is expected to increase from million in to over million in gain on vendor settlements we recorded a gain on vendor settlements of  during while no gain exists during 
table of contents cash flow used in operations cash flow used in operations was million in compared to million in the million increase in the use of cash was attributable to reductions in inventories and accounts receivable in that were not matched in going forward  the company s business plan  which assumes revenue of million  may not require additional funding through provided that tecore continues to make the million quarterly debt installment payments outlined in note to the financial statements 
however  because there can be no guarantee that the business plan targets can be achieved  we have retained an investment advisor to recommend potential new funding sources 
this letter agreement is detailed in note to the financial statements 
there can be no assurances that this investment advisor will be successful in identifying new funding sources acceptable to the company and its security holders 
there are three significant non cash charges  associated with the securities purchase agreement transaction detailed in note to the financial statements  included in our results a compensation expense charge  a debt conversion charge  and a conversion inducement charge 
these charges are explained below 
non cash compensation expense non cash stock compensation expense was million  million and million for the year ended december    and respectively 
these charges are reflected as compensation expense and are included in the operating expenses as engineering  marketing selling and general and administrative or cost of sales based on the department in which the employee who receives the stock options is working 
effective with the closing of the million investment as described in note to the financial statements under the securities purchase agreement  we amended our stock option plan with the approval of our shareholders 
under the amended plan the number of options available for grant was increased to  after the closing of the million investment   options at an exercise price of per share were granted to employees 
the granting of the non qualified stock options to employees will result in a non cash charge to our earnings of million amortized ratably over the two year vesting period ending in september non cash debt conversion interest charge as a result of the conversion feature embedded in the senior debt instruments  which permits the conversion of the debt into our common stock at any time at a specified conversion price  we recorded a charge to interest expense representing the intrinsic value of the conversion feature  limited to the total cash proceeds received from the funding 
accordingly  a charge of million was recorded to interest expense on the closing date of the million investment 
we received an additional payment of million  due by september   on october  and accordingly  we recorded an additional charge related to the beneficial conversion feature embedded in the notes as a charge to interest expense in the fourth quarter of in january we received an additional payment of million from tecore and therefore an additional charge to interest expense of million will be made in the first quarter of assuming tecore makes the five remaining million installment payments for its purchase of the tecore note  we will record additional non cash charges to interest expense  with respect to each installment paid  up to an additional million in each quarter thereafter through march the actual charge to earnings was determined based on the intrinsic value of the conversion feature on the date of the closing of the investment under the securities purchase agreement 
conversion inducement charge this non cash charge resulted from inducement charges associated with the conversion of our series b convertible preferred stock by each of the three holders of that series of preferred stock mellon ventures  lp mellon  tandem pcs investments  lp tandem and scp private equity partners ii  lp scp ii 
this charge resulted in an increase in the loss attributable to common stockholders of million for the year ended december  taking into account the value of the  paid to each of mellon and tandem  the  shares of common stock issued to scp ii and the shares of common stock issued to the holders upon conversion 
the million convertible note investment required voluntary conversion by the holders of series b convertible preferred stock 
the holders converted their preferred shares to common stock at a conversion price of per share half of the effective conversion price but well above the conversion price of per share defined in the securities purchase agreement  see note to the financial statements  effectively waiving their full ratchet anti dilution adjustment rights and giving up all of their rights and privileges 
table of contents as preferred stockholders  including their liquidation preferences 
the holders who converted their preferred shares into common stock also waived their accrued dividends in the aggregate amount of million year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenues net revenues increased million or from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase in revenues was a result of two major orders received for installations ultimately in the overseas market 
gross profit gross profit increased million from a loss of million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the gross profit margin was for and for the increase in the gross profit margin was primarily attributable to a substantial decrease in inventory related charges  including write downs for certain obsolete and excess inventory of million during and our ability to leverage existing inventory to support the increase in revenue without significant procurement of new material 
in addition  warranty expense decreased by million in the period ended december  versus the year ended december  research and development research and development expenses decreased million or from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this decrease was due to previously announced actions taken in the second and third quarters of to reduce operating expenses which included actions to focus development in the areas with the greatest near term potential 
the million dollar decrease included a million reduction in labor and benefit costs  a million reduction in consulting and subcontractor expenses  a million reduction in expensed r d equipment  a million reduction in travel and recruiting expenses  and a million reduction in leased equipment 
the research and development expenses for the year ended december  included an accrual of approximately million for bonuses accrued under a board approved bonuses program that were scheduled to be paid in january sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses decreased million or from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this decrease was due to previously announced actions taken in the second and third quarters of to reduce operating expenses 
the million reduction included a million reduction in labor and benefit costs  a million reduction in consulting and subcontractor expenses  a million reduction in travel expenses and million reduction in trade show expenses 
the sales and marketing expenses for the year ended december  included an accrual of approximately million for bonuses accrued under a board approved bonuses program that were scheduled to be paid in january  but were deferred 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses decreased million or from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the million reduction in expenses was primarily attributable to the recovery of receivables previously accounted for in the provision for doubtful accounts of million 
in addition  there was a reduction in the provision for doubtful accounts of million  and a million reduction in outside legal services 
savings initiatives were also accomplished through a reduction in the aggregate workforce of the company  consolidation of facilities  and an adjustment in certain business functions  streamlining the organization 
the general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  included an accrual of approximately million for bonuses accrued under a board approved bonuses program that were scheduled to be paid in january  but were deferred 
gain on vendor settlements we recorded a gain on vendor settlements of  during as compared to  during the fiscal year gain was a result of the finalization of a company program to enter into agreements with certain vendors to settle outstanding payables in exchange for releasing the company from future obligations 

table of contents liquidity  capital resources  and going concern the accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis  which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business  and  as a consequence  the financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern 
we have experienced net operating losses and negative cash flows since inception and  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
cash used in operations and to fund capital expenditures for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
we expect to have an operating loss in at december   our principal source of liquidity was million of cash and cash equivalents the remaining proceeds from the august senior secured convertible debt funding of million described in note to our financial statements  and six additional m quarterly installment payments associated with the funding described in note one of which has already been received in fiscal year 
such conditions raise substantial doubt that we will be able to continue as a going concern without receiving additional funding 
as of march  our cash balance was million 
in addition  on the same date we had a revenue backlog of million 
our current operating plan projects that cash available from planned revenue combined with the million on hand at march  and the additional million quarterly funding payments may be adequate to defer the requirement for new funding until there can be no assurances that the installments will be received as planned  if at all  or that the anticipated installment payments on the debt financing combined with actual revenue will be adequate to sustain operations through our future results of operations involve a number of significant risks and uncertainties 
the worldwide market for telecommunications products such as ours has seen dramatic reductions in demand as compared to the late s and it is uncertain as to when or whether market conditions will improve 
we have been negatively impacted by this reduction in global demand and by our weak balance sheet 
other factors that could affect our future operating results and cause actual results to vary from expectations include  but are not limited to  dependence on key personnel  dependence on a limited number of customers with three customers accounting for of the revenue for  ability to design new products  the erosion of product prices  ability to overcome deployment and installation challenges in developing countries which may include political and civil risks and risks relating to environmental conditions  product obsolescence  ability to generate consistent sales  ability to finance research and development  government regulation  technological innovations and acceptance  competition  reliance on certain vendors and credit risks 
our ultimate ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time will depend on increasing our revenues and or reducing our expenses and securing enough additional funding to enable us to reach profitability 
our historical sales results and our current backlog do not give us sufficient visibility or predictability to indicate when the required higher sales levels might be achieved  if at all 
if we are unable to receive the outstanding installment payments from the august debt financing  we will have to seek additional funding or dramatically reduce our expenditures and it is likely that we will be required to discontinue operations 
it is unlikely that we will achieve profitable operations in the near term and therefore it is likely our operations will continue to consume cash in the foreseeable future 
we have limited cash resources and therefore we must reduce our negative cash flows or secure additional funding in the near term to continue operations 
on february  we signed a non exclusive agreement an investment advisor to explore the possibility of raising additional financing see note  subsequent events  to these financial statements 
any such placement would require the approval of our senior noteholders  and would likely be subject to additional conditions  and there can be no assurances that we will be able to find such financing 
likewise  there can be no assurances that we will succeed in achieving our goals and failure to do so in the near term will have a material adverse effect on our business  prospects  financial condition and operating results and our ability to continue as a going concern 
as a consequence  we may be forced to seek protection under the bankruptcy laws 
in that event  it is unclear whether we could successfully reorganize our capital structure and operations  or whether we could realize sufficient value for our assets to satisfy fully our debts 
accordingly  should we file for bankruptcy  there is no assurance that our stockholders would receive any value 

table of contents on january   we entered into a bridge loan agreement the loan agreement  with tecore  inc  a texas corporation tecore  and scp private equity partners ii  lp  a delaware limited partnership scp ii  which together with tecore  we call the lenders  pursuant to which each of the lenders agreed to loan us up to million collectively  the commitments or bridge loans  for an aggregate interim financing of million 
we were allowed to draw down the balance of the commitment at our discretion upon compliance with certain conditions set forth in the loan agreement 
the annual interest rate on the bridge loans was plus prime rate as quoted in the wall street journal 
the bridge loans were due on may  but the due date was extended until the closing of the million the investment by the lenders discussed below 
on june   we entered into a securities purchase agreement with tecore and scp ii the purchase agreement for the issuance and sale to scp ii and tecore of senior secured convertible notes the notes in the principal amount of the investment 
the notes are collateralized by a security interest in all of our assets  including without limitation our intellectual property  in favor of the lenders under the terms and conditions of the purchase agreement 
the purchase agreement was attached as an exhibit to our form k filed with the sec on june  on august  our stockholders approved the investment under the purchase agreement and related transactions  and the investment closed on august  on that date  we issued notes of million and million to scp ii and tecore  respectively  and immediately received million in proceeds million each from scp and tecore 
upon the closing of the investment  the principal balance of the bridge loans million was due and paid from the proceeds of the investment 
the interest accrued on these bridge loans was deferred by the lenders and will be due and payable four years from the closing date under the purchase agreement 
the interest at the rate of per annum will compound on the amount of interest deferred under the bridge loans 
net cash used in operating activities net cash used in operating activities was approximately million in  million in  and million in for the year ended december  the cash provided through customer deposits and a reduction in inventories was offset by an increase in accounts receivable  decreases in accounts payable and deferred revenue  and the net loss incurred 
we were able to reduce our inventory balance through fulfillment of customer orders 
as of december   our net accounts receivable balance was million 
of this balance is attributable to two customers 
in addition  our inventory balance includes million of slow moving inventory as of december  we believe that the million is realizable inventory but there can be no assurance of the value that will actually be realized from the sale of this inventory 
as of december  we had million of finished goods inventory at one customer location 
we have filed a ucc perfecting our security interest in the inventory at this customer location 
during the year ended december  the use of cash in operating activities resulted from the net loss  which was offset by a significant reduction in inventories and accounts receivable 
the million increase in the use of cash from the year ended december  to the year ended december  was attributable to reductions in inventories and accounts receivable in that were not matched in going forward  the company s business plan  which assumes revenue of million  may not require additional funding through provided that tecore continues to make the million quarterly debt installment payments outlined in note to the financial statements 
however  given that there can be no guarantee that the business plan targets can be achieved  we have retained an investment advisor to recommend new funding sources 
this letter agreement is detailed in note to the financial statements 
during the year ended december  the significant use of cash by operating activities was the result of the net losses together with the payment of accrued expenses associated with a reduction in workforce and the reduction in accounts payable resulting from the vendor settlements offset by reductions in inventories and accounts receivable 
except for sales to oems or to customers under agreements providing for acceptance concurrent with shipment  our customers are billed as contractual milestones are met 
deposits ranging between and of the contracted amount typically are received at the inception of the contract and an additional percentage of the contracted amount is generally billed upon shipment 
the terms vary from contract to contract 
table of contents but are always agreed to in the initial contract 
most of the remaining unbilled amounts are invoiced after a customer has placed the products in service  completed specified acceptance testing procedures or has otherwise accepted the product 
collection of the entire amounts due under our contracts to date have lagged behind shipment of our products due to the time period between shipment and fulfillment of all of our applicable post shipment contractual obligations  the time at which we bill the remaining balance of the contracted amount 
this lag will require an increase in investments in working capital as our revenues increase 
as of december   our total notes receivable balance was million  all of which was attributable to one customer 
the customer is making monthly payments of principal and interest to satisfy this note receivable 
net cash used in investing activities we used net cash for capital expenditures of approximately million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
during and  we significantly reduced the level of capital expenditures from the level in  as the physical assets available are adequate to meet our needs at this time 
our capital expenditures for testing and manufacturing equipment used during final assembly of our products will increase if our revenues increase 
we lease our primary manufacturing and office facilities under long term non cancelable operating leases 
we also have operating leases for certain other furniture  equipment and computers 
we used net cash for operating leases of approximately million  million and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
future minimum payments for operating leases including payments under our new lease for final assembly and testing facilities in melbourne  florida aggregated through the year were approximately million as of december  and we expect to spend approximately million for those leases in net cash provided by used in financing activities net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was million resulted primarily due to the receipt of the initial million in proceeds from the investment discussed previously and also in note to our financial statements 
in addition we collected million from an outstanding non recourse loan with our ceo 
the non recourse loan was paid in full with accrued interest in september we had million in debt outstanding pursuant to the investment under the purchase agreement as of december  as of february  the investors have advanced a total of million to us  the most recent advance of million having been made on january  there can be no assurance that the installments scheduled each quarter for the remainder of this year will be fulfilled as scheduled  if at all 
net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  was million resulting primarily from the payments on capital leases of million 
we had no debt facilities outstanding as of december  net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was million and was due to net proceeds received from the sale of the series b preferred stock in may of million a portion of which was used to reduce accounts payable in our vendor settlement program 
we lease certain computer and test equipment under capital lease arrangements 
we used net cash for capital leases of approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   december  and december   respectively 
future minimum payments for capital leases aggregated through the year were approximately  as of december  critical accounting policies and estimates we continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our financial statements 
in general  management s estimates are based on historical experience  on information from third party professionals and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances 
actual results could differ from those estimates made by management 

table of contents revenue recognition revenue from product sales is recognized after delivery and determination that the fee is fixed and determinable  collectibilty is probable  and after the resolution of uncertainties regarding satisfaction of significant terms and conditions of the customer contract 
revenue for sales to oems is recognized when title to the product passes to the oem customer 
typically  for these product sales  title passes to the customer at the point of shipment 
we recognize revenue from service agreements on a straight line basis unless our obligation is fulfilled in a different pattern  over the contractual term of the arrangement 
revenue on certain long term projects is recognized on a percentage of completion basis 
the cost incurred to date is taken as a percentage of the estimated cost at completion and this percentage is used to compute revenue on an inception to date basis 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the allowance is reduced when a customer which previously was deemed a collection risk makes payments to the company eliminating the need for the allowance or when a receivable is written off 
accounting for inventory we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write offs may be required beyond the write off that was previously taken 
long lived assets we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
long lived assets totaled million as of december  including licensing and software development costs 
upon our determination that the carrying value of the asset is impaired  we would record an impairment charge or loss 
unsuccessful product marketing or continued substantial operating losses could result in an inability to recover the carrying value of the investment  and therefore  might require an impairment charge in the future

status of our common stock listing on nasdaq national market under continued listing standard one nasdaq rule a  companies listed on the nasdaq national market are required to have net tangible assets of million  total stockholders equity of million  and a minimum bid price of at least per share or a minimum bid price of at least per share with no net tangible asset requirement 
if a stock fails to trade at the minimum bid price level for thirty consecutive business days  nasdaq will notify the company of its deficiency in writing 
the company then has ninety days to cure the deficiency and return its stock to compliance for at least ten consecutive business days but possibly longer at the discretion of nasdaq 
we received notice from nasdaq of our noncompliance with the minimum bid price per share continued listing requirement in nasdaq sent a delisting notice in april and we filed an appeal 
nasdaq granted us additional time and after our shares traded at or above the minimum bid price of for at least ten consecutive trading days  on july  nasdaq sent us a notice of compliance 
accordingly  our stock will continue to be listed on the nasdaq national market  subject to compliance with the applicable listing requirements 
during the months of november and december our share price traded at and below the required minimum of per share  however subsequent to the end of our stock has traded above the required minimum of per share 
we cannot give investors in our common stock any assurance that we will be able to maintain compliance with the per share minimum bid price standard for continued listing on nasdaq and that the liquidity that nasdaq provides will be available to investors in the future 
on august  our shareholders approved a resolution allowing our board of directors the flexibility to implement a reverse stock split if necessary to remain nasdaq compliant 
this authorization expires one year from the approval date 
in the absence of conversion of the secured convertible notes or if we are unable to secure additional equity financing  we expect our stockholders equity to drop below the million requirement under continued listing standard one rule a when we report financial results for the first quarter of fiscal year there can be no assurance that the nasdaq will permit the company to continue its listing on the nasdaq national market or transfer to the nasdaq smallcap if it can not show a definitive plan for maintaining the stockholders equity requirement 
alternatively  continued listing standard two rule b requires a market value of million  the market value of listed shares of million and a minimum bid price of with no stockholders equity requirement 
during portions of the first quarter of  the company satisfied listing standard two 
we cannot give investors in our common stock any assurance that we will be able to maintain compliance with either minimum standard for continued listing on nasdaq national market or the nasdaq smallcap market and that the liquidity that nasdaq provides will be available to investors in the future 
forward looking statements  risks and uncertainties this report contains forward looking statements  including statements under the captions management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  business and elsewhere in this report  concerning our expectations of future sales  gross profits  earnings  research and development expenses  selling  general and administrative expenses  product development and introductions and cash requirements 
forward looking statements often include words or phrases such as will likely result  expect  will continue  anticipate  estimate  intend  plan  project  outlook or similar expressions 
these statements are only predictions and are not guarantees of future performance 
they are subject to certain risks  uncertainties and other factors  some of which are beyond our control  are difficult to predict and could cause 
table of contents actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward looking statements 
actual results may vary materially from those expressed in forward looking statements 
we caution you not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which reflect our management s view only as of the date of this report 
we are not obligated to update these statements or publicly release the results of any revisions to them to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this report or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 
certain risk factors  which could cause actual results to differ from expectations  are set forth below 
we cannot assure you that one or more of these factors will not adversely affect our results of operations 
risk factors you should consider each of the following factors as well as the other information in this annual report in evaluating our business and our prospects 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial may also impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business and financial results could be harmed 
in that case the trading price of our common stock could decline 
you should also refer to the other information set forth in this annual report  including our financial statements and the related notes 
a long lasting downturn in the global economy that impacts the wireless communications industry could negatively affect our revenues and operating results 
the global economy is in the midst of a slowdown that has had wide ranging effects on markets that we serve  particularly wireless communications equipment manufacturers and network operators 
this downturn has had a negative effect on our revenues 
we cannot predict the depth or duration of this downturn  and if it grows more severe or continues for a long period of time  our ability to increase or maintain our revenues and operating results may be impaired 
in addition  because we intend to continue to invest in research and development during this downturn and to maintain ongoing customer service and support capability  any decline in the rate of growth of our revenues will have a significant adverse impact on our operating results 
current economic conditions affecting the wireless communications industry may lead prospective and existing customers to postpone their purchasing decisions 
the industry wide decrease in demand for wireless telecommunications infrastructure has adversely affected us 
we cannot predict when the demand will increase or when many of our customers and potential customers will start to make significant purchases of our products 
we have incurred significant losses since we began doing business 
we anticipate continuing losses and may never achieve or sustain profitability 
we have accumulated losses of million since we began doing business in through december   and we may never achieve or sustain profitability 
we will need to generate significantly higher revenues to achieve and sustain profitability 
since we began doing business in  we have generated million in net revenues through december  we have been marketing our gsm base stations since we have never reported a profit 
we will continue to incur significant research and product development  sales and marketing  materials and general administrative expenses  and we expect our expenses to increase as compared to prior periods  as we expand our sales force and our international operations 
we anticipate a net loss for the year and we may continue to incur losses beyond we cannot be certain that we will realize sufficient revenues or margins to sustain our business 
we may not be able to obtain additional capital to fund our operations on reasonable terms and this could hurt our business and negatively impact our stockholders 
if adequate funds in the form of equity or debt are not available on reasonable terms or terms acceptable to us  we may be unable to continue as a going concern 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of convertible debt or additional equity securities  the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders would be reduced  the securities issued may have rights  preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock  and the terms of the securities may impose restrictions on our operations 
our secured convertible note holders have a senior security interest in all of our assets  and until these investors are paid in full or until they have converted the notes and accrued interest into common stock  we may not be able to obtain additional investment or working capital 

table of contents if the installments due under the million financing by scp ii and tecore are not made on a timely basis  we may be forced to seek protection under the federal bankruptcy laws 
if tecore defaults on an installment payment due to us as payment of the purchase price of its convertible note and if we are unable to raise capital from another source we are likely to cease operations or file for protection from claims of our creditors under the federal bankruptcy laws 
if we are unable to pay principal and interest on the million financing when due  we may be forced to seek protection under the federal bankruptcy laws 
the convertible notes we sold in august in connection with our debt financing are convertible into our common stock at the election of the holders 
if not converted  the principal and accrued interest on the notes become payable in august  subject to acceleration in certain circumstances 
if the notes are not converted and we are unable to pay the principal amount and accrued interest on the notes when due  whether at maturity or by acceleration  the investors could foreclose on the notes and force a sale of our assets  including our intellectual property 
under such circumstances  we may need to cease operations or file for protection from claims of our creditors under the federal bankruptcy laws 
conversion of the secured convertible notes will significantly dilute the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders 
if shares of our common stock are issued to the investors upon conversion of the secured convertible notes together with accrued interest  existing stockholders will have their ownership percentage substantially diluted 
the number of shares of common stock issuable under the terms of the proposed financing will also affect our earnings per share on a going forward basis 
the larger the number of shares deemed outstanding  the lower the earnings per share will be 
the actual effect of any conversion on our earnings per share will depend on the level of our earnings in future periods  the actual amount converted pursuant to the notes and the impact of the accounting treatment of the secured convertible notes 
we have a limited operating history 
you should not rely on our recent results as an indication of our future results 
our base stations are being used in twenty five commercially deployed systems 
we had net revenues of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
unless we can achieve significant increases in market acceptance of our products  we may never advance beyond our market penetration phase 
due to our limited operating history  it is difficult or impossible for us to predict future results and you should not expect future revenue growth based on our recent results 
you should consider our business and prospects in light of the risks and problems faced by technology companies in the early stages of development 
our operating results are subject to substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations and to market downturns 
our revenues  earnings and other operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future 
general economic or other conditions causing a downturn in the market for our products or technology  affecting the timing of customer orders or causing cancellations or rescheduling of orders could also adversely affect our operating results 
moreover  our customers may change delivery schedules or cancel or reduce orders without incurring significant penalties and generally are not subject to minimum purchase requirements 
our future operating results will be affected by many factors  including the following changes in the growth rate of the wireless communications industry  consolidation in the wireless communications industry  our ability to compete successfully against similar and larger sized gsm communications equipment providers  continued control of costs and reducing expenses  efficiently manufacturing our products ourselves and through outsourcing arrangements  absorbing overhead costs through higher manufacturing volume  generating cash flow from operations  the mix of our revenue  
table of contents the collectibility of our trade receivables  our ability to retain existing or secure anticipated customers or orders  both domestically and internationally  the availability and cost of products and services from our third party suppliers  our ability to develop  introduce and market new technology  products and services on a timely basis  our ability to reduce product costs to be cost competitive  foreign currency fluctuations  inflation and deflation  decreases in average selling prices or demand for our products  intellectual property disputes and litigation  government regulations  product defects  the availability of capital to fund operations  management of inventory in response to shifts in market demand  and changes in the mix of technology and products developed  produced and sold 
the foregoing factors are difficult to forecast and these  as well as other factors  could harm our quarterly or annual operating results 
if our operating results fail to meet the expectations of investment analysts or investors in any period  the market price of our common stock may decline 
if we are unable to achieve or maintain profitability  or if we are unable to achieve cash flow breakeven  we will be unable to build a sustainable business 
in this event  the market price of our common stock may decline as well 
our lengthy and variable sales cycle makes it difficult for us to predict if and when a sale will be made and could cause us operating difficulties and cash flow problems 
our sales cycle  which is the period from the generation of a sales lead until the recognition of revenue  can be long and is unpredictable  making it difficult to forecast revenues and operating results 
our inability to accurately predict the timing and magnitude of our sales could cause a number of problems we may have difficulty meeting our customers delivery requirements in the event many large orders are received in a short period of time because we have limited production capacity and generally do not carry materials in inventory  we may expend significant management efforts and incur substantial sales and marketing expenses in a particular period that do not translate into orders during that period or at all 
we may have difficulty meeting our cash flow requirements and obtaining credit because of delays in receiving orders and because the terms of many of our customer contracts defer certain billings until post shipment contractual milestones are met 
the problems resulting from our lengthy and variable sales cycle could impede our growth  harm our stock price  and restrict our ability to take advantage of new opportunities 
investment in our stock is speculative 
in light of the current market conditions for wireless communications and our precarious financial condition  we believe that an investment in our stock is highly speculative 
any investment in our common stock should only be made with discretionary capital  all of which an investor can afford to lose 
our stock price is volatile 
the stock markets in general  and the stock prices of technology based companies in particular  have experienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating 
table of contents performance of any specific public company 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated in the past and is likely to fluctuate in the future as well 
factors that may have a significant impact on the market price of our stock include announcements concerning us  or our competitors  receipt of substantial orders for base stations  quality deficiencies in services or products  announcements regarding financial developments or technological innovations  international developments  such as technology mandates  political developments or changes in economic policies  new commercial products  changes in recommendations of securities analysts  government regulations  acts of terrorism or war  proprietary rights or product or patent litigation 
our future earnings and stock price may be subject to significant volatility  particularly on a quarterly basis 
shortfalls in our revenues or earnings in any given period relative to the levels expected by securities analysts or investors could immediately  significantly and adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 
we may not continue to meet nasdaq listing standards 
under continued listing standard one rule a  companies listed on the nasdaq national market are required to have net tangible assets of million  total stockholders equity of million  and a minimum bid price of at least per share or a minimum bid price of at least per share with no net tangible asset requirement 
during the months of november and december our share price traded at and occasionally below the required minimum bid price of per share for continued listing 
we cannot give investors in our common stock any assurance that we will be able to maintain compliance with the per share minimum bid price standard for continued listing on nasdaq and that the liquidity that nasdaq provides will be available to investors in the future 
in the absence of either conversion of the secured convertible notes or additional equity financing  we expect our stockholders equity to drop below the million requirement under continued listing standard one nasdaq rule a when we report financial results for the first quarter of fiscal year there can be no assurance that the nasdaq will permit us to continue our listing on the nasdaq national market or transfer to the nasdaq smallcap market if it can not show a definitive plan for maintaining the stockholders equity requirement 
alternatively  continued listing standard two nasdaq rule b requires a market value of million  a market value of listed shares of million and a minimum bid price of with no stockholders equity requirement 
during portions of the first quarter of  we satisfied listing standard two 
we cannot give investors in our common stock any assurance that we will be able to maintain compliance with either minimum standard for continued listing on nasdaq national market or the nasdaq smallcap market and that the liquidity that nasdaq provides will be available to investors in the future 
further information pertaining to the continued listing standards for the nasdaq national market and the nasdaq smallcap market can be found on the nasdaq web site 
intense competition in the market for wireless telecommunications equipment from many larger  more established companies with greater resources could prevent us from increasing our revenue and achieving profitability 
the wireless telecommunications infrastructure market is highly competitive 
we compete with large infrastructure manufacturers  systems integrators  and base station subsystem suppliers  as well as new 
table of contents market entrants 
most of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories and presence in key markets  larger installed customer bases  substantially greater name recognition  and more financial  technical  manufacturing  marketing  sales  distribution and other resources than we do 
we may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors  including companies that develop and market new wireless telecommunications products and services 
these competitive pressures may result in price reductions  reduced gross margins  longer sales cycles and loss of customers 
in addition roaming considerations and bundled mobile switch centers mscs price performance competition has impeded our sales in the north american market 
competition in the telecommunications market is based on varying combinations  including comprehensiveness of product and technology solutions  manufacturing capability  scalability and the ability of the system solution to meet customers immediate and future network requirements  product performance and quality  design and engineering capabilities  compliance with industry standards  time to market  system cost  and customer support 
we anticipate that additional competitors will enter our markets as a result of growth opportunities in wireless telecommunications  the trend toward global expansion by foreign and domestic competitors  technological and public policy changes and relatively low barriers to entry in selected segments of the industry 
as a result of these factors  these competitors may be more successful than we are 
in addition  we anticipate additional competitors will enter the market for products based on g or other advanced high speed data standards 
these competitors may have more established relationships and distribution channels in markets not currently deploying wireless communications technology 
these competitors also have established or may establish financial or strategic relationships among themselves or with our existing or potential customers  resellers or other third parties 
these relationships may affect customers decisions to purchase products from us 
accordingly  new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share to our detriment 
our comparative inability to provide financing for our customers is a competitive disadvantage and could result in a loss of sales and or customers to competitors with greater resources 
we do not typically offer financing to our customers  which could cause us to lose business to our larger competitors 
our future success may depend upon our continuing ability to help arrange financing for our customers 
if we cannot assist in arranging financing for our customers  we may lose sales and customers to competitors that directly provide financing 
credit risk problems resulting from customer financing could hurt our results and require us to raise additional capital 
many of our customers and potential customers are start up and small companies with a limited operating history 
in some instances  we have provided and will continue to provide customer financing 
we face credit risks  including slow payments or non payments from customers  and we may need to raise additional capital to support financed sales and to deal with related credit risk problems 
a small number of customers account for substantially all of our revenues and the loss of any of these customers could hurt our results and cause our stock price to decline 
our customer base has been and may continue to be concentrated with a small number of customers 
the loss of any of these customers or the delay  
table of contents reduction or cancellation of orders by or shipments to any of these customers could hurt our results and cause a decline in our stock price 
the effect of these risks on our operating results is compounded by our lengthy sales cycle 
in  sales to three customers accounted for of our total revenue 
in sales to five customers accounted for and in sales to four customers accounted for of total revenue 
the chart below shows the breakout by fiscal year of the concentration of revenue years ended december  tecore wireless systems us government hafatel guam wireless big five oem mbo cross comtel telsom mobile pioneer pinpoint adams we have a concentrated customer base and the failure of any of our customers to pay us or to pay us on time could cause significant cash flow problems  hurt our results and cause our stock price to decline 
our concentrated customer base significantly increases the credit risks associated with slow payments or non payments by our customers 
these risks are also higher for us since many of our customers are start up and small companies 
two customers accounted for of our outstanding accounts and notes receivable as of december   with one customer  tecore  representing 
we are also dependent upon tecore for additional senior debt funding 
two customers accounted for of our combined outstanding accounts and notes receivable as of december  two customers represented of our combined outstanding accounts and notes receivable as of december  in the past we have incurred bad debt charges and we may be required to do so in the future 
the failure of any of our customers to pay us  or to pay us on time  causes significant cash flow problems  hurts our results and could cause our stock price to decline 
intense price performance competition for mobile switch centers will reduce sales opportunities in north american markets 
as a result of the reduction in global demand  our competitors have been bundling mobile switch centers mscs together with base stations at deeply discounted pricing levels targeting our traditional customer base resulting in intense price performance competition 
this competition has substantially reduced opportunities for us to expand or to continue sales of our coverage solution products to small medium sized pcs operators in north america 
we are executing a significant cost reduction program for our products and we have programs in place to enhance the msc price performance to address these competitive pressures but there can be no assurances that these efforts will be successful 
if we are unable to overcome the current competitive pressures facing us in connection with our traditional target market of small to medium operators for cost effective coverage solutions  we may be unable to compete against our larger competitors for future sales to small and medium sized pcs operators in north america 
if we continue to expand into international markets  we will become subject to additional business risks 
we began marketing and selling our products internationally in africa  the middle east  asia and latin america both through oem resellers and our direct sales staff 
our business plan contemplates that a majority of our sales over the next several years will be in international markets 
our revenues from direct sales to international customers as a percentage of total revenues were in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal our revenues from oem international sales were   and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in many international markets  barriers to entry are created by long standing 
table of contents relationships between our potential customers and their local providers and protective regulations  including local content and service requirements 
in addition  our pursuit of international growth opportunities may require significant investments for an extended period before we realize returns  if any  on our investments 
our international operations could be adversely affected by a variety of uncontrollable and changing risks and uncertainties  including difficulties and costs associated with obtaining foreign regulatory approval for our products  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  difficulties and costs associated with complying with a wide variety of complex foreign laws and treaties  legal uncertainties regarding  and timing delays and expenses associated with  tariffs  export licenses and other trade barriers  inadequate protection of intellectual property in foreign countries  increased difficulty in collecting delinquent or unpaid accounts  lack of suitable export financing  adverse tax consequences  dependence upon independent sales representatives and other indirect resellers who may not be as effective and reliable as our employees  difficulties and costs associated with staffing and managing international operations  overcoming cultural  linguistic and nationalistic barriers and adapting to foreign business practices  political and economic instability  and currency fluctuations  including a decrease in the value of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar which could make our products less competitive against those of foreign competitors 
in addition to general risks associated with our international sales and operations  we are subject to risks specific to the individual countries in which we do business 
a portion of our international sales efforts will be targeted to service operators who plan to deploy wireless communications networks in developing countries where risks ordinarily associated with international operations are particularly acute  including developing countries in africa  asia  the middle east and latin america 
any of these factors could impair our ability to expand into international markets and could prevent us from increasing our revenues and achieving profitability 
we sell products to companies in emerging markets in the middle east and africa 
future sales in these markets will be subject to economic  health and political risks 
for the year ended december   our customers in the middle east and africa accounted for approximately of our revenue 
sales in these regions have accounted for a greater proportion of our revenue in prior years  and may account for an increased portion of revenues again in the future 
sales in these markets pose significant additional risks  which include potential inability to enforce contracts or take other legal action  including actions to protect intellectual property rights  difficulty in collecting revenues  obtaining letters of credit  and risks related to fluctuations in currency exchange rates  particularly if sales are denominated in the local currency rather than in us dollars  changes in united states foreign trade policy towards countries in the middle east and africa which may restrict our ability to export products to  or make sales in  those markets and similar changes in those markets policy regarding the united states  and changes in government regulation affecting companies doing business in the middle east and africa  either through export sales or local manufacturing operations 

table of contents in the event our revenue levels from sales to the middle east and africa increase  we will become increasingly subject to these risks 
the occurrence of any of these risks would harm our revenues or cash collections from our customers and could in turn cause our revenue  cash flow or growth to decline and harm our business and results of operations 
sales in certain foreign countries pose unique and significant risks 
a substantial portion of our product sales in were directly or indirectly made to operators in foreign countries  including countries experiencing armed conflict  civil unrest and instability  reports of terrorist activities  and anti american sentiment and activities 
conditions in these countries present unique and significant risks 
actions by foreign governments or hostile forces could result in harm to our personnel or our customers personnel  or the loss of customers and prospective customers and could materially adversely affect our business 
our business and operating results may be harmed by inflation and deflation 
inflation has had and may continue to have adverse effects on the economies and securities markets of certain countries and could have adverse effects on our customers  including their ability to obtain financing and repay debts 
brazil and mexico  for example  have periodically experienced relatively high rates of inflation and currency devaluation 
significant inflation or deflation could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  liquidity and financial position 
if we do not succeed in the development of new products and product features in response to changing technology and standards  customers will not buy our products 
we need to develop new products and product features in response to the evolving demands for better technology or our customers will not buy our products 
the market for our products is characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards  emerging wireless transmission standards  and frequent new product introductions and enhancements 
if we fail to develop our technology  we will lose significant potential market share to our competitors 
our failure to comply with evolving industry standards could delay our introduction of new products 
an international consortium of standards bodies has established the specifications for the third generation g wireless standard  and is further working to establish the specifications of a future wireless standard and its interoperability with existing standards 
any failure of our products to comply with g or future standards could delay their introduction and require costly and time consuming engineering changes 
after the future standard is adopted  any delays in our introduction of next generation products could impair our ability to grow revenues in the future 
as a result  we may be unable to achieve or sustain profitability 
even if we do develop our technology and products to work with these new standards  consumer demand for advanced wireless services may not be sufficient to justify network operators upgrading to them 
our market opportunity could be significantly diminished in the event that gsm or any subsequent gsm based standards do not continue to be or are not widely adopted 
our current products are designed to utilize only gsm  an international standard for voice and data communications 
there are other competing standards including code division multiple access  or cdma  and time division multiple access  or tdma 
in the event that gsm or any gsm based standards do not continue to be or are not broadly adopted  our market opportunity could be significantly limited  which would seriously harm our business 
because some of our key components come from a single source  or require long lead times  we could experience unexpected interruptions  which could cause our operating results to suffer 
a number of our suppliers are sole sources for key components for our products 
these key components are complex  difficult to manufacture and require long lead times 
in the event of a reduction or interruption of supply  or a degradation in quality  as many as six months could be required before we would begin receiving adequate supplies from other suppliers 
supply interruptions could delay product shipments  causing our revenues and operating results to decline 
if we fail to accurately estimate product demand  we may incur expenses for excess inventory or be unable to meet customer requirements 
our customers typically give us firm purchase orders with short lead times before requested shipment 
however  our contract manufacturer requires commitments from us so that it can 
table of contents allocate capacity and be assured of having adequate components and supplies from third parties 
failure to accurately estimate product demand could cause us to incur expenses related to excess inventory or prevent us from meeting customer requirements 
in addition  our products are constantly evolving requiring new assemblies and components 
if we fail to accurately estimate product demand  some inventory could be designed out resulting in excess inventory 
our reliance on a limited number of suppliers could lead to delays  additional costs  problems with our customers and loss of revenue 
a reduction or interruption in component supply or a significant increase in component prices could have a material adverse effect on our business or profitability 
our ability to meet customer demands depends  in part  on our ability to obtain timely and adequate delivery of parts and components from our suppliers and internal manufacturing capacity 
we plan to continue utilizing only one or a small number of suppliers for each of the components of our base station systems 
we have no long term contracts or arrangements with any of our suppliers that guarantee product availability or the continuation of particular payment or credit terms 
if  for any reason  a supplier fails to meet our quality and quantity requirements or stops selling products to us at commercially reasonable prices  we could experience significant production delays and cost increases  as well as higher warranty expenses and product image problems 
we have experienced component shortages in the past  including components for our integrated circuit products  that have adversely affected our operations 
although we work closely with our suppliers to avoid these types of shortages  we may continue to encounter these problems in the future 
any of these problems could damage relationships with current or prospective customers  which could seriously harm our operating results in a given period and impair our ability to generate future sales from time to time  we must replace some of the components of our products when the supplier of that component is discontinuing production 
while we generally do not maintain an inventory of components  sometimes we do purchase an inventory of these discontinued components so that we can maintain production while finding new suppliers or developing substitute components ourselves 
we face the risk that we may deplete that inventory before finding an adequate substitute  and that could cause the loss of significant sales opportunities 
alternatively  we could purchase too many of the components and may be left with excess inventory on our hands 
we generally do not maintain an inventory of finished goods and many components have long lead times  with some taking to weeks from the time of entry of the order to delivery 
we cannot guarantee that alternative sources of supply can be arranged on short notice or that components will be available from alternative sources on satisfactory terms 
we may not be able to adequately protect or defend our proprietary rights  which would hurt our ability to compete 
although we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through patents  trademarks  trade secrets  copyrights  and nondisclosure agreements and other measures  intellectual property is difficult to evaluate and these measures may not provide adequate protection for our proprietary rights and information 
patent filings by third parties  whether made before or after the date of our filings  could render our intellectual property less valuable 
competitors may misappropriate our proprietary rights and information  disputes as to ownership of intellectual property may arise  and our proprietary rights and information may otherwise become known or independently developed by competitors 
the failure to protect our proprietary rights could seriously harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
we have a relatively low number of inventions for which patents have been granted or patent applications are pending internationally 
if we do not obtain sufficient international protection for our intellectual property  our competitiveness in international markets could be significantly impaired  which would limit our growth and future revenues 
others may bring infringement claims against us that could be time consuming and expensive to defend 
in the future  claims of infringement of other parties proprietary rights  invalidity claims or claims for indemnification resulting from infringement claims may be asserted or prosecuted against us 
even if none of these claims were valid or successful  we would be forced to incur significant costs and divert important resources to defend against them 
any claim of infringement  whether or not successful  could cause us considerable expense and place a significant burden on our management 

table of contents a significant decrease in the cost of digital t e phone lines or microwave will diminish one of our competitive advantages 
existing base stations require an expensive physical communications link  usually through a digital t e phone line or microwave  to the wireline network 
any significant decrease in the cost of digital t e phone lines or microwave used to connect base stations to the wireline network  especially in less populated areas  will diminish a cost advantage that we currently use to market our products 
the cost of t e or microwave facilities has recently declined significantly in urban areas because of increased competition 
if we fail to expand our customer base beyond the smaller operators  we may not be able to significantly grow our revenues 
we will only be able to significantly grow our revenues if we can expand our customer base beyond the smaller operators 
there are a limited number of such operators and most of them have limited resources 
these operators are less stable and more susceptible to delays in their buildouts and deployments than more established operators 
we plan on expanding our sales to include the larger domestic operators and international operators 
however  as a result of the rapid consolidation of larger domestic gsm operators  there are only a few larger domestic operators remaining 
to date we have not had any sales to the larger domestic operators  and we may not be successful in those markets in the future 
if we lose key personnel or are unable to hire additional qualified personnel  we may not be able to operate our business successfully 
our future success largely depends on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled hardware and software engineers  particularly call processing engineers and digital signal processing engineers 
if we cannot continue to attract and retain quality personnel  that failure would significantly limit our ability to compete and to grow our business 
our success also depends upon the continuing contributions of our key management  research  product development  sales and marketing and manufacturing personnel  many of whom would be difficult to replace 
except for an employment and severance agreement we have with glenn ehley  our ceo and president  and a noncompetition agreement that we have with terry williams  our cto  we do not have employment or noncompetition agreements with any of our key officers 
we also do not have key man life insurance policies covering any of our employees 
see part i  employees for a discussion of potential impediments to retention of key personnel 
if we fail to manage our operations efficiently  our business and prospects could be seriously harmed 
the need to develop and offer our products and implement our business plan in a difficult market will significantly challenge our planning and management capabilities 
we may not be able to implement management information and control systems in an efficient and timely manner 
if we are unable to manage our operations efficiently  our business and prospects could be seriously harmed 
to manage our operations and personnel  we will need to improve financial and operational controls  as well as our reporting systems and procedures  install new management information systems  and train  motivate and manage our sales and marketing  engineering  technical  finance and customer support employees 
the sarbanes oxley act of requires companies such as airnet that are not expedited filers  to comply with more stringent internal control system and monitoring requirements beginning in this will require that we have a complete internal control system in place by the start of fiscal year compliance with this new requirement may place an expensive burden and significant time constraint on these companies with limited resources 
we have an agreement with motorola  inc to grant them rights  which could harm our business 
when motorola purchased million of our series b preferred stock in  we granted motorola the right to acquire a worldwide  nonexclusive  royalty free license under any two of our patents 
motorola is a large telecommunications and technology company with significant resources and could exercise this right at any time and begin using these licenses to compete against us 
with respect to any possible infringement of our respective digital base station patents  motorola has agreed with us not to enjoin the other and to attempt dispute resolution  including negotiation of nonexclusive license agreements in good faith  before resorting to litigation 

table of contents we expect the prices of our products to decline due to competitive pressures  and this decline could reduce our revenues and gross margins 
we anticipate that the prices of our products will decrease in the future due to competitive pricing pressures  increased sales discounts  new product introductions or other factors 
if we are unable to offset these factors by increasing our sales volumes  our revenues will decline 
in addition  to maintain our gross margins  we must develop and introduce new products and product enhancements  and we must continue to reduce the manufacturing costs of our products 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to do these things successfully 
our failure to do so would cause our revenue and gross margins to decline  which could seriously harm our operating results and cause the price of our common stock to decline 
we may make future acquisitions that dilute our stockholders percentage ownership  cause us to incur debt or assume contingent liabilities and subject us to other risks 
we expect to review opportunities to buy other businesses or technologies that would complement our current products  expand the breadth of our markets  enhance our technical capabilities  help secure critical sources of supply or that may otherwise offer growth opportunities 
while we have no current agreements or negotiations underway  we may buy businesses  products or technologies in the future 
in the event of any future purchases  we could issue stock that would dilute our current stockholders percentage ownership  incur debt  or assume liabilities 
these purchases also involve numerous risks  including problems combining the purchased operations  technologies or products  unanticipated costs  diversion of management s attention from our core business  adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers  risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience  and potential loss of key employees of purchased organizations 
our industry is subject to extensive government regulation that could cause significant delays and expense 
wireless telecommunications are subject to extensive regulation by the us and foreign governments 
if we fail to conform our products to regulatory requirements or experience any delays in obtaining regulatory approvals  we could lose sales 
moreover  in most cases  we only plan to qualify our products in a foreign country once we have a purchase order from a customer located there  and this practice may deter customers or contribute to delays in receiving or filling orders 
continuing regulatory compliance could be expensive and may require time consuming and costly modifications of our products 
any failure of domestic and international regulatory authorities to allocate suitable frequency spectrum could limit our growth opportunities and our future revenues 
because our products are highly complex and are deployed in complex networks  they may have errors or defects that we find only after deployment  which if not remedied could harm our business 
our products are highly complex  are designed to be deployed in complex networks and may contain undetected defects  errors or failures 
although our products are tested during manufacturing and prior to deployment  they can only be fully tested when deployed in commercial networks 
consequently  our customers may discover errors after the products have been deployed 
the occurrence of any defects  errors or failures could result in installation delays  product returns  diversion of our resources  increased service and warranty costs  legal actions by our customers  increased insurance costs and other losses to us or to our customers or end users 
any of these occurrences could also result in the loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products  which would harm our business and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

table of contents directors and officers insurance may be difficult or cost prohibitive to obtain 
our current directors and officers insurance policy was difficult and expensive to obtain 
the policy will expire on december  it may be difficult and or expensive to secure a replacement policy 
if we are unable to renew or secure a replacement policy  we could lose our officers and directors and it will be extremely difficult to recruit qualified replacements for our management team and board of directors  which would have a material adverse affect on our business 
control by our existing stockholders could discourage the potential acquisition of our business 
as of february   or greater stockholders and their affiliates owned million shares of our common stock or approximately of our outstanding shares of common stock 
in addition  two of these stockholders  tecore and scp private equity partners ii  lp scp ii  hold the rights to acquire another million shares of common stock upon conversion or exercise of other securities 
acting together  these stockholders would be able to control all matters requiring approval by stockholders  including the election of directors 
moreover  since the sale of the secured convertible notes with tecore and scp ii  the combined interests of these two investors constitute a controlling interest in the company  with tecore holding a majority of the outstanding shares on a fully diluted basis assuming conversion of tecore s note 
this concentration of ownership could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our business or otherwise discouraging a potential acquirer from attempting to obtain control of us  which could prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium over the market price for their shares of common stock 
some of our larger investors may attempt to sell their common stock  which may depress the market price of our securities 
mellon ventures  scp private equity partners  lp  its affiliate scp ii  tecore and harris corporation each beneficially hold more than of the company s common stock 
scp private equity partners  which at february  held  shares of common stock  has indicated that it would like to sell its common stock due to the winding down of its fund 
other large investors may elect to sell at the same or proximate times 
if any one of these investors sells their common shares  the number of buyers in the market may not support the shares being sold and the market price of our shares could drop 
the effect of these sales could be further accelerated in the event the company is not able to maintain its nasdaq national market listing 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have no derivative financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments in our cash and cash equivalents 
we invest the proceeds from our financing activities in interest bearing  investment grade securities that mature within months 
our transactions are generally conducted  and our accounts are denominated  in united states dollars 
accordingly  these funds were not exposed to significant foreign currency risk at december
