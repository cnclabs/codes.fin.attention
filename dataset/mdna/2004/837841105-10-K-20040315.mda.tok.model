the economic outlook appears to be improving for and is generally viewed as stable 
management views this news favorably  but realizes that economic forecasts are not always reliable 
tsfg is positioned to benefit from potential improvement in the economy 
critical accounting policies and estimates tsfg s accounting policies are in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and with general practice within the banking industry 
the more critical accounting policies include tsfg s accounting for securities  loans  allowance for loan losses  intangibles  derivatives  and income taxes 
in particular  tsfg considers its policies regarding the allowance for loan losses  income taxes  and accounting for acquisitions to be its most critical accounting policies due to the significant degree of the levels of subjectivity and management judgment necessary to account for these matters 
different assumptions in the application of these policies could result in material changes in tsfg s consolidated financial statements 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses allowance represents management s estimate of probable losses inherent in the lending portfolio 
see balance sheet review allowance for loan losses for additional discussion  including the methodology for analyzing the adequacy of the allowance 
this methodology relies upon management s judgment in segregating the portfolio into risk similar segments  computing specific allocations for impaired loans  and setting the amounts within the probable loss range from to of the adjusted historical loss ratio 
management s judgments evolve from an assessment of various issues  including but not limited to the pace of loan growth  emerging portfolio concentrations  risk management system  entry into new markets  new product offerings  loan portfolio quality trends  and uncertainty in current economic and business conditions 
assessing the adequacy of the allowance is a process that requires considerable judgment 
management considers the year end allowance appropriate and adequate to cover probable losses in the loan portfolio 
however  management s judgment is based upon a number of assumptions about current events  which are believed to be reasonable  but which may or may not prove valid 
thus  there can be no assurance that loan losses in future periods will not exceed the current allowance amount or that future increases in the allowance will not be required 
no assurance can be given that management s ongoing evaluation of the loan portfolio in light of changing economic conditions and other relevant circumstances will not require significant future additions to the allowance  thus adversely affecting the operating results of tsfg 
the allowance is also subject to examination and adequacy testing by regulatory agencies  which may consider such factors as the methodology used to determine adequacy and the size of the allowance relative to that of peer institutions  and other adequacy tests 
in addition  such regulatory agencies could require us to adjust our allowance based on information available to them at the time of their examination 
income taxes management uses certain assumptions and estimates in determining income taxes payable or refundable for the current year  deferred income tax liabilities and assets for events recognized differently in its financial statements and income tax returns  and income tax expense 
determining these amounts requires analysis of certain transactions and interpretation of tax laws and regulations 
management exercises considerable judgment in evaluating the amount and timing of recognition of the resulting tax liabilities and assets 
these judgments and estimates are re evaluated on a continual basis as regulatory and business factors change 
no assurance can be given that either the tax returns submitted by management or the income tax reported on the consolidated financial statements will not be adjusted by either adverse rulings by the us tax court  changes in the tax code  or assessments made by the internal revenue service 
tsfg is subject to potential adverse adjustments  including but not limited to an increase in the statutory federal or state income tax rates  the permanent nondeductibility of amounts currently considered deductible either now or in future periods  and the dependency on the generation of future taxable income  including capital gains  in order to ultimately realize deferred income tax assets 
historically  tsfg s estimated income taxes reported on its consolidated financial statements have been materially correct  and management is not aware of any reason that a material change will occur in the future 
the internal revenue service is currently examining tsfg s and federal income tax returns 
accounting for acquisitions tsfg has increased its market share  in part  through bank and non bank acquisitions 
to account for acquisitions since  and in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations  and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  tsfg has used and will continue to use the purchase method of accounting 
under this method  tsfg is required to record assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their fair value  which in many instances involves estimates based on third party  internal  or other valuation techniques 
these estimates also include the establishment of various accruals for planned facilities dispositions and employee benefit related considerations  among other acquisition related items 
in addition  purchase acquisitions typically result in goodwill or other intangible assets  which are subject to periodic impairment tests 
these tests  which tsfg performed as of june  and  use estimates such as discount rates  time periods  and comparable market values in their calculations 
furthermore  the determination of which intangible assets have finite lives is subjective  as well as the determination of the amortization period for such intangible assets 
tsfg tests for goodwill impairment by determining the fair value for each reporting unit and comparing it to the carrying amount 
if the carrying amount exceeds its fair value  the potential for impairment exists  and a second step of impairment testing will be performed 
in the second step  the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill is determined by allocating the reporting unit s fair value to all of its assets recognized and unrecognized and liabilities as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination at the date of the impairment test 
if the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill is lower than its carrying amount  goodwill is impaired and is written down to its fair value 
as part of its initial adoption of sfas  tsfg recorded a million charge related to impairment of goodwill associated with carolina first mortgage company in the valuations as of june  indicated that no impairment charge was required as of that test date 
historically  tsfg s acquisition intangibles reported on its consolidated financial statements have been materially correct  and management is not aware of any reason that a material change will occur in the future
