table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction we are a producer and marketer of nitrogen products for use in agricultural and industrial markets 
nitrogen is a commodity chemical and prices are established based on global supply and demand conditions 
the nitrogen products industry has cycles of oversupply  resulting in lower prices and idled capacity  followed by supply shortages  resulting in high selling prices and higher industry wide production rates 
for example  high nitrogen margins in led to capacity expansion projects globally that resulted in capacity increases that were  in the short term  substantially greater than demand growth  causing oversupply conditions that reduced nitrogen prices 
since  that new global capacity has been partially offset by permanent plant closings in the us and europe 
in order to be viable under these market conditions  a producer must be among the low cost producers to markets it serves and have a financial position that can sustain it during periods of oversupply 
we operate facilities at verdigris  oklahoma and blytheville  arkansas 
during  we determined that future market conditions may not justify the ongoing investment in maintenance and replacement capital necessary to extend operations for the remainder of the blytheville facility s established useful life 
accordingly  a million charge was recorded during the second quarter as an impairment of long lived assets 
while the plant s value is permanently impaired  we resumed production in october in response to higher urea selling prices and improved seasonal demand 
we expect production to continue through at least april  we anticipate to million of spending will be required when the facility is permanently idled 
natural gas is the most significant raw material in the production of nitrogen products 
north american natural gas costs have increased substantially since since we compete with nitrogen products imported from regions with lower natural gas costs  the oversupply situation during most of the three years ending december  did not permit us to increase selling prices to levels necessary to cover the natural gas cost increases 
this resulted in curtailments of north american nitrogen production by terra and other producers 
these curtailments contributed to reductions in global nitrogen product supplies  which have enabled nitrogen price increases to current levels 
our earnings are very sensitive to small changes in the prices of major products and natural gas costs 
assuming verdigris operates at of rated capacity  operating income and cash flows will change by million for a ton change in the price of anhydrous ammonia  million for a ton change in the price of uan solutions and million for mmbtu change to cost of natural gas 
during  the partnership realized selling prices of ton and ton for ammonia and uan solutions  respectively  and paid an average mmbtu for natural gas including the effect of forward purchase decisions 
imports  most of which are produced at facilities with access to fixed price natural gas supplies  account for a significant portion of us nitrogen product supply 
imported products natural gas costs have been and could continue to be substantially lower than the delivered cost of natural gas to our facilities 
offshore producers are most competitive in regions close to the point of entry for imports  including the gulf coast and east coast of north america 
importers are less competitive in serving the main corn growing regions of the us this is due to limited distribution infrastructure and high freight costs to ship products from the ports to end use markets 

table of contents our sales volumes are primarily dependent upon the operating rates for our plants 
we may purchase product from other manufacturers or importers for resale  but gross margins on those volumes would rarely be significant 
the profitability and cash flows from our operations are affected by our ability to manage our costs and expenses other than natural gas  most of which do not materially change for different levels of production or sales 
other factors affecting our operating results include the level of planted acres  transportation costs  weather conditions particularly during the planting season  grain prices and other variables described in items and in the business and properties section of this report 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america for reporting purposes 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amount of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that reflect significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different amounts being reported under different assumptions and conditions 
our critical accounting policies are described below 
impairments of long lived assets we record impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of these items 
our cash flow estimates are based on historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and operating conditions 
the net carrying value of assets not recoverable is reduced to fair value 
our estimates of fair value represent our best estimate based on industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions 
on june   we suspended production at our blytheville facility due to expectations that the facility would not cover its cash costs because of continuing high natural gas costs and the seasonal decline in nitrogen fertilizer demand and prices 
in response to this action and as required by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we commenced a review to determine if the blytheville facility s carrying value was impaired 
this review led us to conclude that future market conditions may not justify the ongoing investment in maintenance and replacement capital necessary to extend operations for the remainder of the facility s established useful life 
accordingly  a million charge was recorded during the second quarter as an impairment of long lived assets 
while the plant s value is permanently impaired  we resumed production in october in response to higher urea selling prices and improved seasonal demand 
we expect production to continue through april  we anticipate to million of spending will be required when the facility is permanently idled 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when title to finished product passes to the customer 
revenue is recognized as the net amount to be received after deducting estimated amounts for discounts and trade allowances 
revenue includes amounts paid by customers for shipping and handling 

table of contents inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost and estimated net realizable value 
the average cost of inventories is determined using the first in  first out method 
the nitrogen industry is characterized by rapid change in both demand and pricing 
rapid declines in demand could result in temporary or permanent production curtailment  while rapid price declines could result in a lower of cost and market adjustment 
derivatives and financial instruments the partnership accounts for derivatives in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas requires the recognition of derivatives in the balance sheet and the measurement of these instruments at fair value 
changes in fair value of derivatives are recorded in earnings unless the normal purchase or sale exception or hedge accounting is elected 
the general partner enters into derivative instruments including future contracts  swap agreements  and purchased options to cap or fix prices for a portion of natural gas production requirements 
the general partner has designated  documented and assessed accounting hedge relationships  which mostly resulted in cash flow hedges that require the partnership to record the derivative assets or liabilities at their fair value on its balance sheet with an offset in other comprehensive income 
amounts are removed from other comprehensive income as the underlying transactions occur and realized gains or losses are recorded 
factors that affect operating performance factors that may affect the partnership s operating results include the relative balance of supply and demand for nitrogen fertilizers  the availability and cost of natural gas  the number of planted acres which is affected by both worldwide demand and government policies  the types of crops planted  the effects general weather patterns have on the timing and duration of fieldwork for crop planting and harvesting  the effect of environmental legislation on supply and demand for the partnership s products  the availability of financing sources to fund seasonal working capital needs and the potential for interruption to operations due to accidents or natural disasters 
the principal raw material used to produce nitrogen products is natural gas 
natural gas costs in accounted for about of total costs and expenses excluding impairment of long lived assets for the partnership 
a significant increase in the price of natural gas that is not covered by forward pricing arrangements or recovered through an increase in the price of related nitrogen products would have an adverse effect on the partnership s business  financial condition and results of operations 
during parts of and  spikes in north american natural gas markets prompted industry wide nitrogen production curtailments 
we produced only and of our total nitrogen capacity in and  respectively  because of plant shutdowns and production curtailments related to high natural gas costs and to balance inventory levels to demand 
a portion of global nitrogen products is manufactured at facilities with access to fixed price natural gas supplies that have been  and could continue to be  priced substantially lower than the partnership s natural gas 
the partnership enters into forward pricing contracts for natural gas so long as such arrangements would not result in costs that would be greater than expected selling prices for finished products manufactured by the partnership 
terra s natural gas forward pricing policy which is applicable to the partnership has 
table of contents been to fix or cap the price of between and of its natural gas requirements for a rolling month period and up to of its natural gas requirements for the subsequent month period through supply contracts  financial derivatives and other instruments 
deviations from this policy are permitted through notification to terra s board of directors 
the partnership s december  forward positions covered of its expected natural gas requirements and none beyond 
prices for nitrogen products are influenced by the world supply and demand balance for ammonia and other nitrogen based products 
long term demand is affected by population growth and rising living standards that influence food consumption 
short term demand is affected by world economic conditions and international trade decisions 
for example  demand was also reduced  in part  due to relatively high nitrogen prices and low grain prices 
supply is affected by increasing worldwide capacity and the availability of nitrogen product exports from major producing regions such as the former soviet union  the middle east and south america 
weather can significantly affect demand for the partnership s products 
weather conditions that delay or intermittently disrupt fieldwork during the planting season may cause agricultural customers to use forms of nitrogen fertilizer that are more or less favorable to the partnership s sales 
weather conditions following harvest may delay or eliminate opportunities to apply fertilizer in the fall 
weather can also have an adverse effect on crop yields  which lowers the income of growers and could impair their ability to pay for crop inputs purchased from terra s dealer customers 
conversely  low crop yields often increase the planted areas in the subsequent growing season  which  in turn  increases the demand for nitrogen fertilizer 
the partnership s business is highly seasonal  with the majority of its products used during the second quarter in conjunction with spring planting 
due to the business seasonality and the relatively brief periods during which products can be used by customers  the partnership and its customers generally build inventories during the second half of the year to ensure product availability during the peak sales season 
for its current level of sales  the partnership requires lines of credit to fund inventory increases and to support customer credit terms 
the partnership believes that its credit facilities are adequate for expected sales levels 
the partnership s operations may be subject to significant interruption if one or more of its facilities were to experience a major accident or natural disaster 
the partnership currently maintains insurance  including business interruption insurance  which it believes is sufficient to allow the partnership to cover major damage to any of its facilities

unit price ammonia uan urea after deducting outbound freight costs revenues for increased million  or  to million compared with million in as the result of higher selling prices partly offset by lower sales volumes 
sales prices were higher as the result of lower nitrogen fertilizer supplies caused by increased demand and industry wide production curtailments 
sales volumes in were lower than the previous year due to curtailments of partnership 
table of contents production 
the partnership ceased production at the blytheville  arkansas facility and at one of the two verdigris  oklahoma ammonia plants on february  because of high natural gas prices 
the partnership resumed full capacity production at both facilities on march  when natural gas prices decreased and product prices improved 
on july   the partnership suspended ammonia and urea production at blytheville due to concerns the facility would not cover its cash costs because of continuing high natural gas costs and seasonal declines in fertilizer prices 
at that time  the partnership recorded a million charge for the impairment of blytheville s long term assets as the partnership s general partner  tnc  concluded that future market conditions may not justify ongoing investment in the maintenance and replacement capital required to operate the blytheville facility for its established useful life 
production resumed at blytheville on october  in response to higher urea selling prices and improved seasonal demand 
tnclp expects blytheville s production to continue through at least april  gross profits during were million and declined million from higher selling prices contributed million to gross profits  but were more than offset by higher natural gas costs  lower sales volumes and idle plant costs 
the cost of natural gas purchases increased million  or over as unit costs  net of forward pricing gains and losses  increased to per million british thermal units mmbtu for compared to mmbtu for natural gas costs in were million higher than spot prices as the result of forward price contracts 
operating expenses of million declined million  or  as the result of reduced headcount and lower spending for administrative activities 
net interest expense of million was million lower than in due to lower borrowing levels and higher cash balances

unit price sales volumes avg 
unit price ammonia uan urea after deducting outbound freight costs revenues for were million and increased million  or  from million in as higher selling volumes were partially offset by substantially lower selling prices 
selling prices were lower as the result of increased supplies of nitrogen fertilizer in contrast to when high natural gas costs caused industry wide production curtailments 
the revenue shortfall from lower prices was more than offset by higher volumes as compared to the previous year 
sales volumes in were depressed due to lower production rates  reduced demand in response to high prices and increased competition from imports 
in  less volatile natural gas costs resulted in more normal production rates and demand increased to pre levels in response to lower nitrogen prices and higher grain prices 
gross profits during totaled million compared to million for the increase in gross profits was primarily related to lower natural gas costs and higher sales volumes  offset in part by reduced selling prices 
natural gas unit costs declined million in reflecting unit costs that  including million of gains of forward pricing contracts  averaged mmbtu during compared to mmbtu in 
table of contents liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities for was million compared to million in  a decline of million principally due to a million increase to working capital needs in compared to a million decline to working capital balances during working capital changes in included reductions to accounts receivable and inventory balances  and an increase in cash received from customers for prepayments  as a result of tighter nitrogen supply demand fundamentals as compared to market conditions at the end of higher selling prices and natural gas costs at the end of compared to required million of cash to fund the increased value of year end accounts receivable and inventory balances 
in addition  accounts payable balances declined million from the prior year primarily as the result of lower credit availability from natural gas suppliers 
offsetting the cash required to fund increases to current assets and reductions in accounts payable balances was a million increase to accrued liabilities and customer prepayments which reflected the higher price and demand for prepayment arrangements as compared to last year 
at december   we had received million of customer prepayments that we expect to be substantially fulfilled during the first half of capital expenditures of million during were used primarily to fund replacement and stay in business additions to plant and equipment 
the partnership expects capital expenditures to approximate million to fund replacement and stay in business additions to plant and equipment 
contractual obligations and commitments to make future payments  other than notes due to affiliates  were as follows at december  payments due in in thousands less than one year one to three years three to five years thereafter capital lease obligations operating leases total the partnership s principal funding needs are to support its working capital and capital expenditures 
the partnership intends to fund its needs primarily from net cash provided by operating activities and  to the extent required  from funds borrowed under the joint revolving bank credit facility described below or from terra capital  inc  the parent of the general partner 
terra  terra capital  inc  the partnership and certain other terra affiliates have a million joint revolving bank credit facility that expires in june under the credit facility  the partnership may borrow an amount generally based on eligible cash balances  of eligible accounts receivable and of eligible finished goods inventory  less outstanding letters of credit 
the partnership s borrowings under the credit facility are secured by substantially all of its working capital 
at december   the partnership had no outstanding borrowings or letters of credit  resulting in availability of approximately million under the facility 
management expects the facility to be adequate to meet the partnership s operating cash needs 
under the credit facility  terra and its subsidiaries  including the partnership  are subject to covenants which impose certain limitations on additional debt  capital expenditures  acquisitions  liens  asset sales  investments  prepayments of subordinated indebtedness  changes in lines of business and transactions with affiliates 
in addition  if terra s aggregate borrowing availability falls below million  terra is required to have generated million of operating cash flows or earnings before interest  income taxes  
table of contents depreciation  amortization and other non cash items as defined in the credit facility for the preceding four quarters 
for the months ended december   terra s operating cash flows as defined in the credit facility were million 
terra is also required to maintain a minimum aggregate unused borrowing availability of million at all times 
at december   terra s aggregate borrowing availability under the facility was approximately million 
terra s ability to continue to meet the covenants under the credit facility in the future will depend on market conditions  operating cash flows  working capital needs  receipt of customer prepayments and trade credit terms 
terra s failure to meet these covenants  or to obtain a waiver from the lenders  would result in a default by all of the borrowers under the credit facility  including the partnership  such that all amounts outstanding to the partnership could become immediately due and payable and the partnership would be unable to borrow additional amounts under the credit facility 
because access to adequate bank facilities is critical to funding the partnership s operating cash needs and the general partner s purchase of financial derivatives to manage the partnership s exposure to natural gas commodity price risk  any default or termination of the joint revolving bank credit facility could have a material adverse effect on the partnership 
terra currently anticipates that it will be able to meet its covenants through nevertheless  if there were to be any adverse changes in the factors discussed above  there can be no assurance that this would be the case 
expenditures related to environmental  health and safety regulation compliance are primarily composed of operating costs that totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
because environmental  health and safety regulations are expected to continue to change and generally to be more restrictive than current requirements  the costs of compliance will likely increase 
the partnership does not expect its compliance with such regulations will have a material adverse effect on its results of operations  financial position or net cash flows 
in addition  the partnership incurred  and  of capital expenditures in and  respectively  related to capital improvements to ensure compliance with environmental  health and safety regulations 
the partnership may be required to install additional air and water quality control equipment  such as low nitrous oxide burners  scrubbers  ammonia sensors and continuous emission monitors to continue to achieve compliance with the clean air act and similar requirements 
these equipment requirements typically apply to competitors as well 
the partnership estimates that the cost of complying with these existing requirements in and beyond will be less than million 
at december   the partnership had a million demand deposit with terra capital  inc that earned interest at  the rate received by terra capital  inc on its commingled cash investments 
as of january   such funds were held in a separate partnership account 
quarterly distributions to tnclp s partners are based on available cash for the quarter as defined in the tnclp agreement of limited partnership 
available cash is defined generally as all cash receipts less all cash disbursements  adjusted for changes in certain reserves established as the general partner determines in its reasonable discretion to be necessary 
distributions paid to the partners in  and were million  million and million  respectively 
distributions of available cash are made to the limited partners and to the general partner  except that the general partner is entitled  as an incentive  to larger percentage interests to the extent that distributions of available cash exceed specified levels 
the specified levels are increased by the amount 
table of contents of quarterly distributions to holders of common units that are less than per unit 
as of december   the cumulative shortfall on quarterly distributions to holders of common units that must be paid before the general partner receives an incentive payment was million  or per unit 
the partnership anticipates that approximately million in pension funding will be required in recently issued accounting standards financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no

general partner option to effect mandatory redemption of partnership units at december   the general partner and its affiliates owned of the partnership s outstanding units 
when less than of the issued and outstanding units are held by non affiliates of the general partner  as is the case at december   the partnership  at the general partner s sole discretion  may call  or assign to the general partner or its affiliates its right to acquire  all such outstanding units held by non affiliated persons 
if the general partner elects to acquire all outstanding units  the partnership is required to give at least but not more than days notice of its decision to purchase the outstanding units 
the purchase price per unit will be the greater of the average of the previous trading days closing prices as of the date five days before the purchase is announced and the highest price paid by the general partner or any of its affiliates for any unit within the days preceding the date the purchase is announced 
dependence on terra industries the partnership is dependent on terra in a number of respects 
the partnership s bank facilities are  as noted in liquidity and capital resources  dependent on terra s results and financial condition 
terra provides all of the partnership s management services and operates all of its facilities through its wholly owned subsidiary tnc  the partnership s general partner 
terra and its wholly owned subsidiaries  including tnc  have more debt and debt service requirements than the partnership 
although terra is affected by most of the factors that affect the partnership  its higher level of debt could put a greater risk on terra in the event business conditions deteriorate materially 
the partnership s results of operations and financial condition might be materially adversely affected by financial difficulties at terra  default by it or its subsidiaries on their debt or their bankruptcy

forward looking precautions information contained in this report  other than historical information  may be considered forward looking 
forward looking information reflects management s current views of future events and financial performance that involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include  but are not limited to  the following changes in the financial markets  general economic conditions within the agricultural industry  competitive factors and price changes principally  nitrogen products selling prices and natural gas costs  changes in product mix  changes in the seasonality of demand patterns  changes in weather conditions  changes in agricultural regulations  and other risks detailed in the factors that affect operating results section of this discussion 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management and financial instruments market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the financial position  results of operations or cash flows of the partnership due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices and rates 
the partnership uses derivative financial instruments to manage risk in the area of changes in natural gas prices 
the partnership has no foreign currency exchange rate risk and all debt carries variable interest rates and approximates fair value 
the general partner s policy is to avoid unnecessary risk and to limit  to the extent practical  risks associated with operating activities 
the general manager may not engage in activities that expose the partnership to speculative or non operating risks 
management is expected to limit risks to acceptable levels 
the use of derivative financial instruments is consistent with the overall business objectives of the partnership 
derivatives are used to manage operating risk within the limits established by the general partner s board of directors  and in response to identified exposures  provided they qualify as hedge activities 
as such  derivative financial instruments are used to hedge firm commitments and forecasted commodity purchase transactions 
the use of derivative financial instruments subjects the partnership to some inherent risks associated with future contractual commitments  including market and operational risks  credit risk associated with counterparties  product location basis differentials and market liquidity 
the general partner continuously monitors the valuation of identified risks and adjusts the portfolio based on current market conditions 
natural gas is the principal raw material used to manufacture nitrogen 
natural gas prices are volatile and the general partner manages some of this volatility through the use of derivative commodity instruments 
terra industries hedging policy which is applicable to tnclp is described under the previous heading  factors that affect operating performance 
the partnership has hedged of expected requirements and none of its requirements beyond december  the fair value of these instruments is estimated based on published referenced prices and quoted market prices from brokers 
these instruments fixed natural gas prices at million lower than published prices for december  forward markets 
market risk is estimated as the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical adverse price change 
as of december   the partnership s market risk exposure related to future hedged natural gas requirements was million based on a sensitivity analysis 
changes in the market value of these derivative instruments have a high correlation to changes in the spot price of natural gas 
since the partnership forward prices only a portion of its natural gas requirements  this hypothetical adverse impact on natural gas derivative instruments should be more than offset by lower costs for natural gas purchases
