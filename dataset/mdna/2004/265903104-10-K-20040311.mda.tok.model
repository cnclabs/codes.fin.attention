dura s principal use of liquidity will be to meet debt service requirements  finance capital expenditures and to provide working capital availability 
dura expects that capital expenditures in will be approximately million 
these capital expenditures will be used primarily for equipment and dedicated tooling purchases and facility improvements 
dura s ability to service its indebtedness will depend on its future performance  which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial  business  regulatory and other factors 
certain of these factors are beyond dura s control 
dura believes that  based upon current levels of operations  it will be able to meet its debt service obligations when due 
significant assumptions underlie this belief  including  among other things  that dura will continue to be successful in implementing its business strategy and that there will be no material adverse developments in its business  liquidity or capital requirements 
if dura cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service its indebtedness and to meet its other obligations and commitments  dura might be required to refinance its debt or to dispose of assets to obtain funds for such purpose 
there is no assurance that refinancing or asset dispositions could be effected on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms  if at all  or would be permitted by the terms of the new credit agreement 
in the event that dura is unable to refinance the new credit agreement or raise funds through asset sales  sales of equity or otherwise  its ability to pay principal of  and interest on  its debt would be impaired 
contractual obligations the following table presents dura s contractual obligations at december  in thousands payments due by period less than two three four five more than total one year years years five years long term debt      senior notes   subordinated notes   capital lease obligations and other noncurrent liabilities  mandatorily redeemable convertible trust preferred securities   operating leases a      total      a operating leases include lease commitments of million that are recorded in facility consolidation cost reserves 
in addition to the obligations noted above  dura has obligations reported as other long term liabilities that consist principally of pension and post retirement benefits  obligations for facility closure and consolidation costs and legal and environmental liabilities 
at december   dura is not party to an significant purchase obligations for goods or services 
off balance sheet arrangements dura uses standby letters of credit to guarantee its performance under various contracts and arrangements  principally in connection with our workers compensation liabilities with insurers 
these letters of credit contracts expire annually and are usually extended on a year to year basis 
at december   dura had outstanding letters of credit of million 
dura does not believe that they will be required to be drawn 
dura currently has no non consolidated special purpose entity arrangements 
significant accounting policies dura s significant accounting policies are more fully described in note of the consolidated financial statements 
certain of dura s accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
revenue recognition and sales commitments 
dura recognizes revenue as its products are shipped to its customers 
dura enters into agreements with its customers at the beginning of a given vehicle s life to produce products 
once such agreements are entered into by dura  fulfillment of the customers purchasing requirements is the obligation of dura for the entire production life of the vehicle  with terms of up to seven years  and dura has no provisions to terminate such contracts 
in certain instances  dura may be committed under existing agreements to supply product to its customers at selling prices which are not sufficient to cover the direct cost to produce such product 
in such situations  dura records a liability for the estimated future amount of such losses 
such losses are recognized at the time that the loss is probable and reasonably estimable and are recorded at the minimum amount necessary to fulfill dura s obligations to its customers 
valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired  and  prior to the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  was amortized over years 
effective january   goodwill is no longer amortized  but is instead subjected to annual impairment testing in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
other assets principally consist of pension plan assets in excess of accumulated benefits  debt financing costs  which are being amortized over the term of the applicable agreements  other intangible assets  and deferred income taxes 
other intangible assets at december  are approximately million primarily consisting of non amortizable trademarks and amortizable license agreements 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires all business combinations initiated after june  to be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
under sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized  but reviewed for impairment annually  or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
separable intangible assets that are not deemed to have indefinite lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives  but with no maximum life 
the amortization provisions of sfas no 
apply to goodwill and intangible assets acquired after june  with respect to goodwill and intangible assets acquired prior to july   dura adopted sfas no 
effective january  upon adoption of sfas no 
 dura completed step one of the transitional goodwill impairment test  using a combination of valuation techniques  including the discounted cash flow approach and the market multiple approach  for each of its four reporting units control systems  body glass  mobile products and other operating companies 
upon completion of the required assessments under sfas no 
 it was determined that the fair market value of the goodwill assigned to dura s control systems and other operating companies reporting units was lower than its book value  resulting in a transitional impairment charge of approximately million  representing the write off of percent of the control systems reporting unit goodwill and percent of the other operating companies reporting unit goodwill 
the write off was recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in dura s consolidated statement of operations for the quarter ended march  under the valuation techniques and approach applied by dura in its sfas no 
analysis  a change in certain key assumptions applied  such as the discount rate  projected future cash flows and mix cash flows by geographic region could significantly impact the results of dura s assessment 
dura performs impairment tests annually  during the second quarter  and whenever events or circumstances occur indicating that goodwill or other intangible assets might be impaired 
based upon dura s annual assessment during  no impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets has occurred 
accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing its consolidated financial statements dura is required to estimate its income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
this process involves dura estimating its actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within dura s consolidated balance sheet 
dura must then assess the likelihood that its deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent it believes that recovery is not likely  dura must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent dura establishes a valuation allowance or increases this allowance in a period  it must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining dura s provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against its net deferred tax assets 
dura has recorded a valuation allowance of million as of december   due to uncertainties related to its ability to utilize some of its deferred tax assets  primarily certain net operating loss carryovers before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on dura s estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which it operates and the period over which its deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or dura adjusts these estimates in future periods  the effects of these adjustments could materially impact dura s financial position and results of operations 
the net deferred tax asset as of december  was million  net of a valuation allowance of million 
defined benefit plans and post retirement benefits 
dura sponsors defined benefit plans that cover certain hourly and salaried employees in the united states and certain european countries 
dura s policy is to make annual contributions to the plans to fund the normal cost as required by local regulations 
in addition  dura has ten postretirement medical benefit plans for certain employee groups and has recorded a liability for its estimated obligation under these plans 
in calculating obligation and expense  dura is required to select certain actuarial assumptions 
these assumptions include discount rate  expected long term rate of return on plan assets and rates of increase in compensation and healthcare costs 
dura s assumptions are determined based on current market conditions  historical information and consultation with and input from its actuaries 
dura has historically used september as its annual measurement date 
for  dura assumed a discount rate of to percent for its pension benefits  and percent for its post retirement benefits other than pensions to determine its benefit obligations 
holding other variables constant such as expected return on plan assets and rate of compensation increase  a one percentage point decrease in the discount rate related to dura s most significant plans would have increased dura s expense by million and obligations by million 
dura employs a building block approach in determining the expected long term rate of return for plan assets  based on historical markets  long term historical relationships between equities and fixed income and considering current market factors such as inflation and interest rates 
holding other variables constant such as discount rate and rate of compensation increase a one percentage point decrease in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets related to dura s most significant plans would have increased dura s expense by million 
dura expects to contribute million to its pension plans and million to its postretirement medical benefit plans in dura employs a total return investment approach in managing pension plan assets whereby a mix of equities and fixed income investments are used to maximize the long term return of plan assets for a prudent level of risk 
at december   dura s us pension assets are comprised of equity securities  debt securities and other investments 
specifically related to dura s post retirement medical benefit plans  assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for these plans 
holding other variables constant  a one percentage point decrease in assumed health care cost trend rates would have decreased dura s expense by approximately million and post retirement benefit obligation by approximately million 
while any negative impact of these significant accounting policies would generally result in non cash charges to earnings  the severity of any charge and its impact on stockholders investment could adversely affect dura s borrowing agreements  cost of capital and ability to raise external capital 
dura s senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of its board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed its disclosure in this management discussion and analysis 
quarterly results of operations and seasonality dura typically experiences decreased revenues and operating income during the third calendar quarter of each year due to production shutdowns at oems for model changeovers and vacations 
the recreation vehicle market is seasonal in that sales in the fourth quarter are normally at reduced levels 
effects of inflation inflation potentially affects dura in two principal ways 
first  a significant portion of dura s debt is tied to prevailing short term interest rates which may change as a result of inflation rates  translating into changes in interest expense 
second  general inflation can impact material purchases  labor and other costs 
in many cases  dura has limited ability to pass through inflation related cost increases due to the competitive nature of the markets that dura serves 
in the past few years  however  inflation has not been a significant factor 
market risk dura is exposed to various market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as foreign currency exchange and interest rates 
dura does not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
dura enters into financial instruments to manage and reduce the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
the counterparties are major financial institutions 
dura manages its interest rate risk by balancing the amount of fixed and variable debt 
for fixed rate debt  interest rate changes affect the fair market value of such debt  but do not impact earnings or cash flows 
conversely for variable rate debt  interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value of such debt but do impact future earnings and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant 
at december   giving effect to the interest rate swaps discussed below  dura had fixed rate debt of million and variable rate debt of million 
holding other variables constant such as foreign exchange rates and debt levels  a one percentage point increase in interest rates would have decreased the fair market value of dura s debt at december  by approximately million  million of which relates to dura s interest rate swap agreements see below  and would be expected to have an estimated impact on pre tax earnings and cash flows for the next year of approximately million 
at december   dura had outstanding interest rate swap contracts that effectively converted million of its senior notes into floating rate obligations 
under these swap contracts  which expire in april  dura receives payments at fixed rates  while it makes payments at variable rates percent to approximately percent at december  
the net interest paid or received is included in interest expense 
dura designated these swap contracts as fair value hedges at their inception 
at december   the fair value of the interest rate swap contracts was a net gain position for dura of approximately million  representing the estimated benefit that would accrue to dura to terminate the agreements  and is included in current and noncurrent assets with a corresponding increase to debt in the accompanying consolidated december  balance sheet 
from time to time  dura also uses forward exchange contracts to hedge its foreign currency exposure related to certain intercompany transactions 
dura designated these contracts at their inception as a cash flow hedge 
at december   dura had no outstanding forward exchange contracts 
foreign currency transactions a significant portion of dura s revenues during the year ended december  were derived from manufacturing operations in europe  canada and latin america 
the results of operations and the financial position of dura s operations in these countries are principally measured in their respective currency and translated into us dollars 
the effects of foreign currency fluctuations in such countries are somewhat mitigated by the fact that expenses are generally incurred in the same currencies in which revenues are generated 
the reported income of these subsidiaries will be higher or lower depending on a weakening or strengthening of the us dollar against the respective foreign currency 
a significant portion of dura s assets at december  are based in its foreign operations and are translated into us dollars at foreign currency exchange rates in effect as of the end of each period  with the effect of such translation reflected as a separate component of stockholders investment 
accordingly  dura s consolidated stockholders investment will fluctuate depending upon the weakening or strengthening of the us dollar against the respective foreign currency 
dura s strategy for management of currency risk relies primarily upon conducting its operations in such countries respective currency and dura may  from time to time  engage in hedging programs intended to reduce dura s exposure to currency fluctuations see discussion above on market risk
