item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the information required by this item is incorporated by reference from pages through of the annual report under the caption  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
cautionary statement certain statements that we may make from time to time  including statements contained in this report  constitute forward looking statements under the federal securities laws 
forward looking statements may be identified by words such as plans  expects  believes  anticipates  estimates  projects  will and other words of similar meaning used in conjunction with  among other things  discussions of future operations  acquisitions and divestitures  financial performance  our strategy for growth  product development and new product launches  market position  and expenditures 
forward looking statements are based on current expectations of future events  but actual results could vary materially from our expectations and projections 
investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward looking statements 
we assume no obligation to update any forward looking statements 
we caution that historical results should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statement include the following  some of which are described in greater detail below the pattern of our sales  including variations in sales volume within periods  consumer demands and preferences  including the acceptance by our customers and consumers of new products and line extensions  the mix of products sold  our ability to control and reduce our internal costs and the cost of raw materials  competitive factors  including prices  promotional incentives  and trade terms for our products  and our response  as well as those of our customers and competitors  to changes in these terms  product introductions and innovations by us and our competitors  technological advances by us and our competitors  new patents granted to us and our competitors  changes in exchange rates in one or more of our geographic markets  changes in laws and regulations  including trade regulations  accounting standards and tax laws  governmental actions affecting the manufacturing and sale of our products  unstable governments and legal systems  and nationalization of industries  changes in accounting policies  acquisition  divestiture  and collaborative activities by us  our competitors  or customers  and the impact of general political and economic conditions or hostilities in the united states and in other parts of the world 
competitive environment we experience intense competition for sales of our products in most markets 
our products compete with widely advertised  well known  branded products  as well as private label products  which typically are sold at lower prices 
in most of our markets  we have major competitors  some of which are larger and more diversified than we are 
in march  energizer holdings  inc acquired the schick blade and razor business and  in certain countries  the wilkinson sword blade and razor business  from pfizer inc we anticipate increased competition in our blades and razors segment as a result of this change in business ownership 
aggressive competition within our markets to preserve  gain  or regain market share can affect our results in any given period 
changes in technology and new product introductions in most product categories in which we compete  there are continuous technological changes and frequent introductions of new products and line extensions 
our ability to introduce new products and or extend lines of established products successfully will depend on  among other things  our ability to identify changing consumer tastes and needs  develop new technologies  differentiate our products  and gain market acceptance of new products 
we cannot be certain that we will successfully achieve these goals 
with respect specifically to primary alkaline batteries  category growth could be adversely affected by the following additional factors technological or design changes in portable electronic and other devices that use batteries as a power source  continued improvement in the service life of primary batteries  improvements in rechargeable battery technology  or the development of new battery technologies 
intellectual property we rely upon patent  copyright  trademark  and trade secret laws in the united states and in other countries to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in technology  products  and our brands 
our intellectual property rights  however  could be challenged  invalidated  or circumvented 
we do not believe that our products infringe the intellectual property rights of others  but any such claims  if they were successful  could result in material liabilities or loss of business 
cost savings strategy we have implemented and approved a number of programs designed to reduce costs 
such programs will require  among other things  the consolidation and integration of facilities  functions  systems  and procedures  all of which present significant management challenges 
there can be no assurance that such actions will be accomplished as rapidly as anticipated or that the full extent of expected cost reductions will be achieved 
sales and operations outside of the united states sales outside of the united states represent a substantial portion of our business 
in addition  we have a number of manufacturing facilities and suppliers located outside of the united states 
accordingly  the following factors could adversely affect operating results in any reporting period changes in political or economic conditions  trade protection measures  import or export licensing requirements  changes in the mix of earnings taxed at varying rates  changes in regulatory requirements or tax laws  and longer payment cycles in certain countries 
we are also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to our sales  profits  and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
although we use instruments to hedge certain foreign currency risks through foreign currency forward  swap  and option contracts and non us dollar denominated financings and we are partially hedged through our foreign manufacturing operations  there can be no assurance that we will be fully protected against foreign currency fluctuations and our reported earnings will be affected by changes in exchange rates 
retail environment with the growing trend toward retail trade consolidation  especially in developed markets such as the united states and europe  we are increasingly dependent upon key retailers whose bargaining strength is growing 
accordingly  we face greater pressure from significant retail trade customers to provide more favorable trade terms 
we can be negatively affected by changes in the policies of our retail trade customers  such as trade inventory levels  access to shelf space  and other conditions 
many of our customers  particularly our high volume retail trade customers  have engaged in accelerated efforts to reduce inventory levels and shrinkage and to change inventory delivery systems 
while we expect the level of trade inventory of our products to decline over time  the speed and magnitude of such reductions and or our inability to develop satisfactory inventory delivery systems could adversely affect operating results in any reporting period 
effect of potential military action or war recent military hostilities and the threat of future hostilities  as well as attendant political activity  have created an atmosphere of economic uncertainty throughout the world 
a disruption in our supply chain  an increase in import or export costs  and or other macroeconomic events resulting from military or political events could adversely affect operating results in any reporting period
