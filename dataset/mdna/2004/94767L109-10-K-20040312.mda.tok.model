customers and distribution partners we sell our services directly to our customers and indirectly through our distribution partners 
we offer our services on a monthly subscription basis to our customers and through a revenue sharing  discounted or pay per use basis through our distribution partners 
our customers purchase and use our services themselves while our distribution partners integrate and resell our services with their offerings 
some of our distribution partners are also end user customers 
as of december  and  we had subscription agreements with over  and  direct customers  respectively 
in  we derived approximately of our revenue from direct sales to customers 
typically  our direct sales contracts are for an initial non cancelable term ranging from three to twelve months  and then automatically renew for the same period unless terminated by either party 
as of december   we had agreements in place with approximately distribution partners  including portals  software and service vendors and communications service providers 
in we generated approximately of our revenue from these relationships 
software and service vendors have agreements to resell our services to end users by marketing  and in some cases int egrating  our services into their product or service offerings 
communications service providers typically resell our services in conjunction with their teleconferencing services 
our distribution agreements typically have terms of one to three years and are automatically renewed for additional one year terms unless either party terminates the agreement with days prior written notice 
in most of these agreements  the distribution partner purchases subscription or pay per use services from us and resells such services to end user customers 
under these agreements  the amount of revenue we receive depends on the level of commitment and volume of business generated under the agreement 
under our distribution agreements  either we or the distribution partner bills the end user customers 
when we bill the end user  a percentage of the proceeds generated from the distribution partner s sale of our services is paid to the distribution partner and the remainder is retained by us 
when the distribution partner bills the end user  we sell the services on a discounted basis to the distribution partner  which in turn marks up the price and sells the services to the end user 
in  sales of our meeting center service  whether directly to our customers or indirectly through our distribution partners  accounted for approximately of our revenue 
in and  respectively  sales of our meeting center service accounted for and of our revenue 
this reduction in meeting center sales as a percentage of our total revenue may continue as we introduce new service offerings and increase revenue in other existing services 
third party software and hardware we license software and purchase hardware  such as database  operating system  and web server software  font technology and servers  routers  and audio conference bridges 
we believe that use of third party vendors enables us to integrate current and emerging technologies into our proprietary service offerings 
we purchase  or license  these third party technologies from companies including bea systems application servers  bitstream font technology  oracle database technology  rackable servers  sun microsystems servers  veritas file management  and voyant audio conference bridges 
while the loss of one or more of these vendors may result in the need to identify  secure and integrate alternative technologies  we believe we can obtain  from other sources and on comparable business terms  third party software or hardware functionally comparable to that provided by these third party vendors 
research and development the emerging market for web communications services is characterized by rapid technological change  new product introductions and enhancements  evolving customer requirements and rapidly changing industry standards 
we devote a substantial portion of our resources to developing and enhancing our network services and application platform  extending our global network  and conducting quality assurance testing 
as of december   we had employees engaged in research and development activities 
our research and development expenditures were approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
we expect to continue to devote significant resources to research and development for the foreseeable future 
a significant amount of our development and testing activity is conducted by our subsidiary in china webex china 
prior to february  our development and testing activity was conducted by three companies in china  which are owned by our president and chief technical officer  mr 
min zhu  and his spouse 
in february  webex china acquired substantially all of the assets of these three companies for a cash purchase price of million and hired approximately of their employees 
the valuation of the assets was 
table of contents determined by an independent appraisal and the purchase was approved by our board of directors 
prior to the completion of this asset purchase  we had contracts with these companies under which they performed development projects  assigned ownership of the work performed to us  and invoiced us for services rendered based on a monthly fee per employee working on webex projects 
as of december   of the employees in our webex china operations employees were engaged in research and development activities 
we rely on webex china for a significant portion of our quality assurance  software development and other activities 
sales and marketing our sales efforts target a broad range of businesses  government agencies and non profit organizations primarily through direct sales channels and  to a lesser extent  through indirect sales channels 
direct sales are generated through our internal sales force  while indirect sales are generated through agreements with our distribution partners 
our internal sales force uses our own webex services to maximize the effectiveness and efficiency of our direct sales channel 
as of december   we had employees engaged in sales and marketing activities 
our sales and marketing expenditures were approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
we expect to continue to devote significant resources to sales and marketing for the foreseeable future 
our marketing programs include customer needs assessment and market analysis  service and platform marketing  brand awareness  advertising  public relations  lead generation  and educating organizations in our target markets 
in december  we entered into an agreement with a celebrity spokesperson whom we have featured and whom we continue to feature in our print  electronic and digital media advertising campaigns we derive sales revenues from both north american based and non north american based customers 
in  and  the percentage of revenues from north american based customers was   and  respectively 
in  and  the percentage of revenues from our non north american based customers was   and  respectively 
competition the market for web communications services is intensely competitive  subject to rapid change and is significantly affected by new product and service introductions and other market activities of industry participants 
although we do not currently compete against any one entity with respect to all aspects of our services  we do compete with various companies in regards to specific elements of our web communications services 
for example  we compete with providers of traditional communications technologies such as teleconferencing and videoconferencing  applications software and tools companies  and web conferencing services such as centra software  genesys  raindance  ibm  oracle  macromedia  and microsoft 
in january  cisco systems  inc acquired latitude communications  a competitor of webex 
other companies could choose to extend their products and services to include web co mmunications services in the future 
many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories  significantly greater financial  technical and other resources and greater name recognition than we have 
our current and future competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
some of these competitors  such as microsoft  have dominant positions in other technology markets and may seek to leverage those positions to expand their presence in the web communications services market  which may make it more difficult for other vendors  such as webex  to compete 
in addition  current and potential competitors have established  and may in the future establish  cooperative relationships with third parties and with each other to increase the availability of their products and services to the marketplace 
competitors may introduce products or services that have better capabilities or performance  lower prices  or broader distribution or market acceptance which could cause us to lose customers  lose revenue and earnings  lose market share or require us to increase expenses or reduce the price of our services  any of which could harm our business and operating results 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in our market include service functionality  quality and performance  ease of use  reliability  scalability and security of services  customer service and support  establishing a significant base of customers and distribution partners  ability to introduce new services to the market in a timely manner  ability to integrate with third party offerings and services  and pricing 

table of contents although we believe our services compete favorably with respect to many of these factors  the market for our services is new and rapidly evolving 
we may not be able to maintain our competitive position against current and potential competitors  especially those with greater resources such as ibm  microsoft and cisco 
intellectual property the status of united states patent protection in the internet industry is not well defined and will evolve as the us patent and trademark office grants additional patents 
we currently have ten issued patents in the areas of peer to peer connections to facilitate conferencing  document annotation  optimizing data transfer  and graphical user interface for extracting video presentations  and we currently have patent applications pending in the united states 
we may seek additional patents in the future 
we do not know if our patent applications or any future patent application will result in any patents being issued with the scope of the claims we seek  if such patents are issued at all 
we do not know whether any patents we have received or may receive will be challenged  invalidated or be of any value 
it is difficult to monitor unauthorized use of technology  particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states  and our competitors may independently develop technology similar to ours 
we will continue to seek patent and other intellectual property protections  when appropriate  for those aspects of our technology that we believe constitute innovations providing significant competitive advantages 
the pending  and any future  patent applications may not result in the issuance of valid patents 
our success depends in part upon our rights to proprietary technology 
we rely on a combination of copyright  trade secret  trademark and contractual protection to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
we require our employees  to enter into confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements upon commencement of employment 
before we will disclose any confidential aspects of our services  technology or business plans to customers  potential business distribution partners and other non employees  we routinely require such persons to enter into confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements 
in addition  we require all employees  and those consultants involved in the deployment of our services  to agree to assign to us any proprietary information  inventions or other intellectual property they generate  or come to possess  while employed by us 
despite our efforts to protect our prop rietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our services or technology 
these precautions may not prevent misappropriation or infringement of our intellectual property 
third parties may infringe or misappropriate our copyrights  trademarks and similar proprietary rights 
in addition  we may be subject to claims of alleged infringement of patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties 
we may be unaware of filed patent applications which have not yet been made public and which relate to our services 
from time to time  we have received notices alleging that we infringe intellectual property rights of third parties 
in such cases  we investigate the relevant facts  respond to the allegations and  where case facts and other conditions warrant  consider settlement options 
for example  in march  we received a letter from a company alleging that we infringed several of that company s patents 
we reviewed the company s allegations and other relevant patents and publications and responded by providing arguments and materials supporting our position that we do not infringe the cited patents and that the patents are invalid 
intellectual property claims may be asserted against us in the future 
intellectual property litigation is expensive and time consuming and could divert management s attention away from running our business 
intellectual property litigation could also require us to develop non infringing technology or enter into royalty or license agreements 
these royalty or license agreements  if required  may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
our failure or inability to develop non infringing technology or license the proprietary rights on a timely basis would harm our business 
employees as of december   we had  full time employees  including in research and development  in sales and marketing  in set up  support and training  and in general and administrative 
as of december   of our employees are based overseas  including in china as part of our webex china subsidiary 
none of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements 
we believe our relations with our employees are good

our corporate and technical operations headquarters is located in san jose  california 
in addition  we have eight non us subsidiaries through which we conduct various operating activities related to our business 
in each of the non us jurisdictions in which we have subsidiaries  china  hong kong  japan  australia  the united kingdom  france  germany and the netherlands  we have employees or consultants engaged in sales and  in some cases  network maintenance activities 
in the case of our china subsidiary  our largest subsidiary  our employees perform activities including quality assurance testing and software development activities  creation of technical documentation  background research for our sales personnel  preparation of marketing materials and the provisioning of customer web sites 
in december  we announced that we had signed an agreement to acquire cyberbazaar  a private company located in bangalore  india 
as of the date of this report  this transaction has not yet closed 
we anticipate that this transaction will close during the first fiscal quarter of  and if and when such closing occurs we will have a subsidiary in india 

table of contents revenue and cash generation models 
we sell our services directly to customers  which both in the fourth quarter of and for the full year accounted for approximately of our revenue  or million and million  respectively  and also indirectly through our distribution partners  which both in the fourth quarter of and for the full year accounted for approximately of our revenue  or million and million  respectively 
we enter into distribution relationships so that we can increase total revenue by acquiring customers through distribution partners that we could not acquire through our direct sales efforts 
we contract directly with the distribution partner  and revenue is recognized based on net amounts charged to the distribution p artner 
historically  revenue has been generated based on a monthly  fixed fee subscription pricing model 
a customer may subscribe to a certain number of concurrent user ports per month  which would enable the customer to have that a set number of users connected to webex meetings at any one time  or to a minimum minutes commitment  which would enable the customer to have set number of minutes to utilize our services 
we refer to the revenue associated with these monthly  fixed fee subscription arrangements  measured as of the end of any month  as committed revenue 
in addition  there are several situations in which customers are charged per minute or usage based pricing 
these include customer overage fees for port customers  usage of minutes in excess of the minimum commitment  telephony  certain distribution partner arrangements and individual pay per use purchased directly from our website 
overage fees are charged when a customer subscribing to a set number of ports uses more than the subscribed number of ports in one or more web conference sessions 
per minute fees are assessed when a customer on a minutes pricing model uses more than their monthly commitment 
per minute telephone revenue comes when a customer in a web conference session elects to have us set up and run the audio portion of the conference  rather than the customer conducting its telephone usage independently of us 
a majority of revenue received from our telecommunicati ons partner arrangements is usage  or per minute  based 
finally  when a customer wants to use our services on a one time basis by visiting our website  purchasing the service and paying online by credit card  the pricing is per minute or usage based 
we refer to the revenue derived from this per minute or usage based pricing model  measured as of the end of any month  as uncommitted revenue 
uncommitted revenue is increasing as a percentage of our total revenue 
market opportunities  related challenges and our responses 
we believe the market for web conferencing services to be healthy and growing 
various published articles have cited several trends underlying this projected market increase 
one trend is the desire of many companies to achieve cost savings in the areas of information technology  or it  spending and employee travel 
in light of increased it budget constraints reportedly faced by many companies  we believe a cost saving decision is to hire an external web conferencing vendor to meet a company s web conferencing needs  rather than undertaking the capital and personnel spending necessary to construct and maintain an internal company web conferencing network 
additionally  companies may perceive that web conferencing usage can reduce costs to the extent that web conferencing displa ces the need for individuals within companies to travel in order to conduct business  conduct training or participate in large attendee events 
another trend favoring the projected growth of the web conferencing market is the relative infancy of the web conferencing market 
as with other technologies  there is a certain rate of adoption associated with web conferencing 
there are early adopters a relatively small percentage of potential users who first discover and make use of a new technology 
if the product is useful  a second wave of users arises which is often many times larger than the early adopters 
this larger number of users materializes because employers start to understand the utility of the technology and encourage or require employee usage of the technology 
eventually  if the utility of the technology is compelling enough  the technology becomes a staple of most workplaces and the technology is deemed mainstream 
the greatest growth in the market occurs during this migration from second wave to mainstrea m usage 
one such example of this adoption pattern is usage of the desktop computer during the s 
another example is usage of word processing software associated with the desktop computer during the s 
in each instance  time required to migrate from the early adoption phase to the mainstream phase exceeded ten years 
with some technologies  the adoption pattern described above does not materialize fully 
if a technology has experienced early adopter or second wave usage but then proves not as useful as first believed or touted  or if an alternative technology emerges  that technology may never progress to mainstream use 
we believe that  at present  web conferencing appears to be in either a very late early adopter or an early second wave phase 
usage of the technology has penetrated many worldwide corporations  but with many of these customers  this penetration is in only one or a few divisions or departments of the corporation and thus the percentage of employee users is still fairly low 
so  there may remain ahead for web conferencing the critical transition period from second wave to mainstream adoption  where we believe the annual rate of growth of usage would exceed previous rates of grow th 
however  there can be no assurance that web conferencing will progress to mainstream use  and in fact usage of web conferencing could regress 
there exist a number of challenges to the projected market growth scenario for web conferencing 
one is a concern  actual or perceived  about security 
as the universe of corporate activities that can be conducted in a web conference expands  more and more of these activities will embrace sensitive corporate financial data  plans  projects or other proprietary information 
if web conferencing technologies do not have embedded within them adequate security protections so that the contents of a web conference will remain private 
table of contents among the participants  usage may not grow as projected 
morevoer  to the extent that there occur publicized incidents of security breaches associated with usage of a web conferencing technology  no matter who the vendor  the security related concerns of would be users of the technology likely will be increased and this could dampen market growth 
we have assigned a high priority  in the design and implementation of our webex mediatone network  to these security issues 
another challenge to broad adoption of web conferencing services is general acceptance of this mode of communication as a normal part of business activity 
individuals may not feel comfortable using the technology  or they may prefer traditional means of communicating such as the telephone or face to face meetings 
broad adoption of web conferencing will require users to incorporate the use of this technology as part of their normal business activity 
industry wide factors relevant to us 
the web communications services market is intensely competitive  subject to rapid change and is significantly affected by new product and service introductions and other market activities of industry participants 
although we do not currently compete against any one entity with respect to all aspects of our services  we do compete with various companies in regards to specific elements of our web communications services 
for example  we compete with providers of traditional communications technologies such as teleconferencing and videoconferencing  applications software and tools companies  and web conferencing services such as centra software  genesys  raindance  ibm  oracle  macromedia  and microsoft 
in addition  in january cisco systems  inc acquired latitude communications  a competitor of webex 
in april  microsoft acquired our competitor placeware 
microsoft is currently offering the placeware delivered web conferencing service under the name microsoft office live meeting 
office live meeting is a feature of the microsoft office system  a suite of software application products that was launched during late as a result of its acquisition of placeware and its marketing of the office live meeting service  microsoft could become a far more active and significant competitor in the web communications market 
microsoft may devote greater technical and marketing resources to the web communications market than it has in the past 
for example  microsoft could invest a significant amount of financial and technical resources in improving the office live meeting offering  could more extensively integrate office live meeting within past  present and future versions of the mi crosoft office software product  could extend the capability of its other products to include capabilities more directly competitive with webex  or could develop entirely new web communications technologies 
in addition  microsoft could seek to leverage its dominant market position in the operating system  productivity application or browser market to expand its presence in the web communications market  which may make it difficult for other vendors  like us  to compete 
for example  if microsoft were to successfully integrate a web communications capability into a future operating system software product  the revenues of its competitors in this market  like us  could be significantly negatively affected 
critical accounting policies and estimates we believe that there are a number of accounting policies that are critical to understanding our historical and future performance  as these policies affect the reported amounts of revenue and the more significant areas involving management s judgments and estimates 
these significant accounting policies relate to revenue recognition  sales reserves  the allowance for doubtful accounts and deferred income taxes 
the policies  and our procedures related to these policies  are described in detail below 
revenue recognition 
revenue is derived from the sale of web communications services 
web communications services revenue is generated through a variety of contractual arrangements directly with customers and with distribution partners  who in turn sell the services to customers 
the company sells web communications services directly to customers through service subscriptions and pay per use arrangements 
under these arrangements  customers access the application hosted on webex servers using a standard web browser 
subscription arrangements include monthly subscriber user fees  user set up fees and training 
the subscription arrangements are considered service arrangements in accordance with eitf issue no 
 application of aicpa statement of position  software revenue recognition  to arrangements that include the right to use softw are stored on another entity s hardware  and with multiple deliverables under eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  which became effective during under eitf  all deliverables are considered one unit of accounting  therefore  committed revenue is recognized ratably over the current term of the contract 
variable usage based fees are recognized as usage occurs 
during the initial term  the company provides training services  web page design and set up services 
in addition to subscription services revenue  webex derives revenue from pay per use services and telephony charges that are recognized as the related services are provided 
we also enter into reselling arrangements with distribution partners  which purchase and resell our services on a revenue sharing  discounted or pay per use basis 
revenue under these arrangements is derived from our services provided to end users and is recognized over the service period provided that evidence of the arrangement exists  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
initial set up fees received in connection with these arrangements are recognized ratably over the initial term of the contract 
during the initial term  we provide training services  web page design and set up services 
service fees are recognized as the services are provided 
table of contents for pay per use service arrangements and ratably over the service period for services provided on a subscription basis through the reseller 
our reseller arrangements may require guaranteed minimum revenue commitments that are billed in advance to the reseller 
advance payments received from distribution partners are deferred until the related services are provided or until otherwise earned by us 
we contract directly with the distribution partner  and revenue is recognized based on net amounts charged to the distribution partner 
persuasive evidence for all of our arrangements is represented by a signed contract 
the fee is considered fixed or determinable if it is not subject to refund or adjustment 
collectibility of guaranteed minimum revenue commitments by resellers is not reasonably assured  thus revenue from guaranteed minimum commitments is deferred until collected from the reseller and services are provided to an end user customer or commitment fees are forfeited by the reseller at the end of the commitment period 
we recently began recognizing revenue from a reseller based in china with whom we have an agreement but who is otherwise unaffiliated with webex 
due to certain legal restrictions in china relating to our ability to sell directly to customers in china  we entered into the reseller arrangement 
under this arrangement  we license our communication service offerings to the reseller for resale in china  and in consideration we receive licensing royalty revenue 
royalty revenue due to us is based on the level of revenue reported by the reseller and is recognized on a cash received basis from the reseller 
also in  subsequent to recognizing some revenue from our china based reseller  we entered into a loan agreement with this reseller 
under the terms of the agreement  webex will loan our reseller operating capital to partially fund its early stage operations 
the reseller is curren tly operating at a loss and has a negative cash flow 
repayment of the loan amount by the reseller will be dependent on either another source of capital or profitable  cash positive operation of the reseller 
we believe that repayment is doubtful and therefore we have reserved the current amount outstanding on the loan of million through a charge to sales and marketing expense 
no additional revenue will be recognized from this reseller until all outstanding loan amounts are paid in full 
sales reserves 
the sales reserve is an estimate for losses on receivables resulting from customer credits  cancellations and terminations and is recorded as a reduction in revenue at the time of the sale 
increases to sales reserve are charged to revenue  reducing the revenue otherwise reportable 
the sales reserve estimate is based on an analysis of the historical rate of credits  cancellations and terminations 
the accuracy of the estimate is dependent on the rate of future credits  cancellations and terminations being consistent with the historical rate 
if the rate of actual credits  cancellations and terminations is different than the historical rate  revenue would be different from what was reported 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we record an allowance for doubtful accounts to provide for losses on accounts receivable due to customer credit risk 
increases to the allowance for doubtful accounts are charged to general and administrative expense as bad debt expense 
losses on accounts receivable due to financial distress or failure of the customer are charged to the allowance for doubtful accounts 
the allowance estimate is based on an analysis of the historical rate of credit losses 
the accuracy of the estimate is dependent on the future rate of credit losses being consistent with the historical rate 
if the rate of future credit losses is greater than the historical rate  then the allowance for doubtful accounts may not be sufficient to provide for actual credit losses 
we assess  on a quarterly basis  the adequacy of the sales reserve account balance and the allowance for doubtful accounts account balance based on historical experience 
any adjustments to these accounts are reflected in the income statement for the current period  as an adjustment to revenue in the case of the sales reserve and as a general and administrative expense in the case of the allowance for doubtful accounts 

table of contents the following presents the detail of the changes in the sales reserve and allowance for doubtful accounts for the last eight quarters ended december   in thousands quarter ended december  september  june  march  december  september  june  march  balance at beginning of quarter sales reserve balance at beginning of quarter deducted from revenue amounts written off change balance at end of quarter allowance for doubtful accounts balance at beginning of quarter charged credited to bad debt expense amounts written off change balance at end of quarter balance at end of quarter 
gross accounts receivable reserve as a percentage of accounts receivable deferred income taxes 
we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities at the end of each period based on the future tax consequences that can be attributed to net operating loss and credit carryovers and differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  using the tax rate expected to be in effect when the taxes are actually paid or recovered 
the recognition of deferred tax assets is reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that the tax benefits will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
we consider past performance  expected future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the amount of the valuation allowance 
our forecast of expected future taxable income is based over such future periods that we believe can be reasonably estimated 
changes in market conditions that differ materially from our current expectations and changes in future tax laws in the us and in international jurisdictions may cause us to change our judgements of future taxable income 
these changes  if any  may require us to adjust our existing tax valuation allowance higher or lower than the amount we have recorded 
in the fourth quarter of  as a result of our assessment of projected future income  we released million of valuation allowance against deferred tax assets 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  consolidated statement of operations data as a percentage of revenue 
years ended december  net revenue cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative equity based compensation total operating expenses operating income loss interest and other income  net income loss before income taxes income tax expense benefit net income loss net revenue 
net revenue increased from million in to million in and to million in  representing an increase of from to and an increase of from to these increases were primarily due to growth in our subscribing customer base and the increased adoption by existing customers 
by the end of  the number of customers in our subscribing base had grown by more than from the end of one of the measurement tools  or metrics  which we use to help forecast future revenues is what we refer to as our monthly run rate  or what we sometimes call mrr 
we define our monthly run rate as the sum of the following i committed monthly subscriptions  or the aggregate dollar amount of minimum minutes and ports that are contractually committed to us  as of the end of the month  and ii uncommitted revenue  or the aggregate dollar amounts of per minute or usage based services such as overage  telephone  reseller related and pay per use revenues  for the month 
our monthly subscription contracts at the end of december were approximately million and our uncommitted revenue in december was million  and thus our monthly run rate exiting december was million 
certain one time charges  such as set up fees  are not captured in mrr 
another metric we use to analyze customer losses and to help forecast future revenues is average lost subscription mrr 
our lost subscription mrr metric is somewhat analogous to customer churn in the telecommunications business 
we define our lost subscription mrr as the quotient obtained from the following i the average monthly dollar amount of lost subscription contracts during the quarter  or one third of the total contract dollar amount of ports subscriptions and minimum minutes subscriptions that have expired or otherwise terminated during the quarter  divided by ii our total subscriptions at the end of the last month of the quarter plus the average monthly lost subscription contracts for the quarter 
as can be understood from the definition of lost subscription mrr  we calculate and evaluate lost subscription mrr on a quarterly basis 
our lost subscription mrr for the three months ended december  was 
the following table shows our mrr  and lost subscription mrr  for the five quarters ended december  in millions quarter ended december  september  june  march  december  uncommitted usage in last month of quarter contracted subscriptions at the end of the quarter total mrr of subscription mrr lost cost of revenue 
our cost of revenue consists of costs related to user set up  network and data center operations  technical support and training activities including internet access and telephony communication costs  personnel  licensed software and equipment costs and depreciation 
cost of revenue increased from million in to million in and to million in as a percent of revenue  cost of revenue decreased from in to in and to in these increases in absolute dollars in cost of revenue were primarily due to increases in the cost for delivering existing and new services to more customers  additional technical staff to 
table of contents support our growing installed base of customers and new services  and expanding and improving our worldwide network 
in february  we purchased land and a building containing approximately  square feet of commercial grade facility of which  square feet consists of data infrastructure facility floor space for million 
as part of the purchase  we also acquired certain items of data infrastructure equipment previously installed and situated on the property 
during we intend to move and expand our primary switching center facility to this building to accommodate growing usage requirements on our webex mediatone network 
sales and marketing 
our sales and marketing expense consists of personnel costs  including commissions  as well as costs of public relations  advertising  marketing programs  lead generation  travel and trade shows 
sales and marketing expense increased from million in to million in and to million in these increases were primarily due to increased sales spending to expand our sales force and in marketing spending for advertising focused on building brand awareness and generating sales leads 
in we entered into a loan agreement with an unaffiliated reseller of our services in china 
under the terms of the agreement  webex will loan our reseller operating capital to partially fund its early stage operations 
the reseller is currently operating at a loss and has a negative cash flow 
repayment of the loan amount by the reseller will be dependent on either another source of capital or profitable  cash positive operation of the reseller 
we believe that repayment is doubtful and therefore we have reserved the current amount outstanding on the loan of million through a charge to sales and marketing expense 
revenue is recognized on a cash received basis from the reseller 
no revenue will be recognized from this reseller until all outstanding loan amounts have been paid in full 
research and development 
our research and development expense consists primarily of salaries and other personnel related expenses  depreciation of equipment  supplies and consulting engineering services 
research and development expense increased from million in to million in and to million in the increase in research and development expense from to was primarily due to personnel related expenses resulting from increases in staffing and incremental payments to three companies in china providing engineering services to us on a contract basis 
included in research and development expense are million and million  in and  respectively  for the cost of engineering services provided by these companies in china 
our subsidiary webex china acquired substantially all of the assets of  and hired a substantial majority of the then employees of  these companies in february the increase in research and development expense from to was primarily due to personnel related expenses resulting from increases in research and development personnel including increases in webex china 
general and administrative 
our general and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel costs for finance  human resources  legal and general management  as well as professional expenses  such as legal and accounting  and bad debt expense 
general and administrative expense increased from million in to million in and decreased to million in the increases from to were primarily due to higher professional fees  bad debt expense  personnel and payroll related expenses 
bad debt expense increased from million in to million in this increase in bad debt expense was primarily related to the increased size of our installed customer base  which was used to calculate potential future credit losses based on historical losses 
the decrease in general and administrative expense from t o was primarily due to the decrease of bad debt expense 
bad debt expense decreased from million in to million in as a result of lower credit losses compared to historical periods 
losses written off to the allowance for bad debt in were million compared to million in we expect general and administrative expense to increase due to increased personnel and professional expenses to address the new regulations including new regulations imposed by the sarbanes oxley act of we expect bad debt expense to increase as a result of the increased size of our installed customer base 
equity based compensation 
our equity based compensation expense represents the amortization of deferred equity based compensation over the vesting period of incentive stock options granted to employees and expenses related to issuance of common stock warrants and options to non employees 
deferred equity based compensation represents the difference between the exercise price of the stock options granted to employees and the fair value of common stock at the time of those grants 
equity based compensation expense decreased from million in to million in and to million in the decreases from year to year were primarily due to the vesting of options granted  forfeitures of unvested options by terminated employees and the effects of the fluctuations of our stock price on the recognition of expense on options granted to non e mployees  offset by additional compensation expenses due to the modification of fixed awards in connection with terminated employees 
equity based compensation expense related to the unvested portion of non employee options will be impacted by future changes in our stock price and will fluctuate accordingly 
in connection with the calculation of equity based compensation expense  members of our board of directors are treated the same as employees of webex 
interest and other income  net 
interest and other income  net is comprised of interest income and expense and certain other expenses 
interest and other income  net increased from million in to million in and to million in the increase from to was primarily due to lower impairment charges on an investmentand increased interest income as a result of higher cash and short term investments offset by lower market interest rates 
in and  other expenses included impairment write downs of million and million  respectively  of a million investment in a distribution partner  tonbu  inc the impairment charges on our investment in tonbu resulted from a determination that an other than temporary decline in its value had occurred after the evaluation of 
table of contents several factors  including recent capital raising activities undertaken by tonbu 
the increase from to was primarily due to higher interest earned as a result of increased cash invested  offset by lower market interest rates 
in  other expenses included a loss from currency exchange of million as a result of non functional currency transactions of our subsidiaries 
income taxes 
because we incurred net operating losses in  we paid no federal  state and foreign income taxes in that period  nor did we recognize any tax benefits for the related tax operating loss carryforwards 
during  we realized pre tax earnings and we had net operating loss carryforwards available to offset taxable income in the us we recorded a provision for income tax of million during related to foreign and state taxes 
in  we continued to experience profitability and therefore had evidence to support the recognition of deferred tax assets 
accordingly  in we recorded a provision for income tax of million related to foreign and state income taxes which was offset by the release of a valuation allowance in the amount of million based on projected future income 
the recognized net deferred tax assets of million are shown in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
as of december   we had approximately million and million of net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state purposes  respectively  available to offset income in future years 
the federal net operating loss carryforwards expire in various years from to and the state net operating loss carryforwards expire beginning in  though it is uncertain whether that expiration date will be adjusted or otherwise affected by the current california moratorium on the use of state net operating loss carryforwards 
we had approximately million of net operating loss carryforwards for foreign income tax purposes 
the foreign net operating losses can be carried forward indefinitely 
net income loss 
as a result of the foregoing  we reported net income of million in and million in and net loss of million in liquidity and capital resources in  we sold  shares of common stock in a private placement  which resulted in net proceeds to us of million 
the sale of our equity securities funded our research and development and sales and marketing expenses to build our current service offerings and establish our current customer base 
we have generated net positive cash flow from operations since the third quarter of we anticipate cash flow from operations will fund our current operations as well as fund future expansion 
as of december   cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were million  an increase of million compared with cash and cash equivalents of million as of december  as of december  and  we had no debt 
net cash provided by used in operating activities was million in  million in and million in cash provided by operating activities in and was the result of net income adjusted for non cash components offset by increases in accounts receivable 
net cash used in resulted primarily from net losses adjusted for non cash components and increases in accounts receivable offset by increases in accrued liabilities and deferred revenue 
net cash used in investing activities was million in  million in and million in net cash used by investing activities related primarily to the purchase of short term investments and capital expenditures for equipment  hardware and software used in our mediatone network offset by the full repayment of a loan to our chief executive officer in and in  and  cash spent on property  plant and equipment was million  million and million  respectively 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in  million in and million in cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to the private placement of common stock and bank borrowings in  and the exercise of stock options and employee purchases of common stock in and cash provided by financing activities was partially offset by the repayment of debt in we have a revolving credit line with a bank that provides available borrowings of up to million 
amounts borrowed under the revolving credit line bear interest at the prime rate and may be repaid and reborrowed at any time prior to the maturity date 
the credit agreement expires on july  the credit agreement is unsecured and is subject to compliance with covenants  including a minimum quick ratio and minimum profitability 
as of december   we had no outstanding borrowings under the credit line 
as of december   our outstanding purchase commitments  including those for usage of telecommunication lines and data services  equipment and software purchases and construction of leasehold improvements at new leased facilities  totaled million 
we expect the majority of these purchase commitments to be settled in cash within the next months with the longest commitment expiring in 
table of contents august we lease office facilities under various operating leases that expire through total future minimum lease payments under these leases are approximately million 
in the first quarter of  we purchased land and a building for approximately million 
additional cash will be required to move and expand our existing switching center to the new facility during in december  we announced that we had signed an agreement to acquire cyberbazaar of bangalore india 
we anticipate that this transaction will close during the first fiscal quarter of  and if and when such closing occurs we will pay the existing owners approximately million of the purchase price 
an additional compensation payment based on performance of as much as million may be paid one year from the closing 
we expect that existing cash resources will be sufficient to fund our anticipated working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next months 
we generated positive cash flow from operations in each quarter of we anticipate that we will continue to generate positive cash flow from operations in and that existing cash reserves will therefore be sufficient to meet our capital and operating requirements during this period 
if revenue in is less than anticipated  we may take steps to reduce our discretionary expenses  such as marketing  reduce planned capital expenditures or limit the growth of personnel 
if cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may seek to sell additional public or private equity securities or obtain additional debt financing 
there can be no assurance that additional financing would be available at all or  if available  would be obtainable on terms favorable to us 
if we are unable to obtain additional financing  we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned technology and product development and sales and marketing efforts  which could harm our business  financial condition and operating results 
additional financing may also be dilutive to our existing stockholders 
long term contracts the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities reflected on the registrant s balance sheet under gaap total recent accounting pronouncements see note t of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements including the respective expected dates of adoption and effects on results of operations and financial condition 
factors that may affect results the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
if an adverse outcome of any of the following risks actually occurs  our business  financial condition or results of operations could suffer 
although we realized net earnings for each of the eight prior fiscal quarters including the four in  there is no assurance that we will be able to achieve comparable results in the future  and we may experience net losses in future years or quarters 
we realized net earnings in each of the eight fiscal quarters in and however  we may experience net losses in future years or quarters if the web communications market softens significantly  or if existing or future competitors reduce our current market share of the web communications market 
if we incur net losses in the future  we may not be able to maintain or increase the number of our employees  our investment in expanding our services and network  or our sales  marketing and research and development programs in accordance with our present plans  each of which is critical to our long term success 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 

table of contents because our quarterly results vary and are difficult to predict  we may fail to meet quarterly financial expectations  which may cause our stock price to decline 
because of the emerging nature of the market for web communications services  and because of the uncertain impact of competitors  our quarterly revenue and operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and may vary from publicly announced quarterly or annual financial guidance 
in addition  because we have two different pricing models and the less predictable of the two is beginning to represent a greater percentage of our revenue  our revenue and operating results will be more difficult to predict 
from a revenue standpoint  our dominant pricing model has been a monthly  fixed fee subscription model 
a customer may subscribe to a certain number of concurrent user ports per month  which would enable the customer to have that same number of users connected to webex meetings at any one time  or to a minimum minutes commitment which would provide the customer with a set number of minutes to utilize our services 
in addition  there are several situations in which customers are charged per minute  or usage based pricing 
these include customer overage fees for port customers  usage of minutes in excess of the minimum commitment  telephony  certain distribution partner arrangements and individual pay per use purchased directly from our website 
overage fees are charged when a customer subscribing to a set number of ports uses more than the subscribed number of ports in one or more web conference sessions 
per minute fees are assessed when a customer on a minutes pricing model uses more than their monthly commitment 
per minute telephone revenue comes when a customer in a web conference session elects to have webex set up and run the audio portion of the conference  rather than the customer conducting its telephone usage independently of webex 
the vast majority of revenue received from our t elecommunications partner arrangements is usage  or per minute  based 
finally  when a customer wants to use webex services on a one time basis by visiting our website and purchases the service by paying online by credit card  the pricing is per minute or usage based 
historically  the majority of our revenue has been fixed fee  but an increasing percentage of our revenue is derived from usage based pricing models 
the various usage based revenue sources are more variable and difficult to predict than our fixed fee subscription revenue sources  given that customer demand may vary from month to month depending on a number of factors  such as number of business days in a month or vacation patterns 
accordingly  to the extent the percent of our revenue derived from the various per minute or usage based sources increases  our overall revenue numbers becomes more difficult to predict 
since fixed fee revenue is what we refer to as committed revenue  and the usage based revenue is what we call uncommitted revenue  another way to describe this increasing unpredictability is that our uncommitted revenues are growing faster than our committed revenues 
a number of other factors could also cause fluctuations in our operating results 
factors outside our control include our distribution partners degree of success in distributing our services to end users  the announcement  introduction and market acceptance of new or enhanced services or products by our competitors  changes in offerings or pricing policies of our competitors and our distributors  market acceptance of our services  the growth rate of the market for web communications services  and a trend toward lower average per minute prices in the telecommunications sector generally 
factors within our control include our ability to develop  enhance and maintain our web communications network in a timely manner  the mix of services we offer  and our introduction of new and enhanced services  our ability to attract and retain customers  
table of contents the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to expansion of our business and network infrastructure  and changes in our pricing policies or the introduction of new pricing models such as our introduction in early of a per minute  or usage based subscription pricing model 
if any of these factors impact our business in an unplanned negative way in a particular period  our operating results may be below market expectations  in which case the market price of our common stock would likely decline 
also  factors such as the growth rate of the market for our services  our ability to maintain and enhance our network services and platform  and our competitors success could impact our longer term financial performance by reducing demand for our services 
we expect that our operating expenses will continue to increase  and if our revenue does not correspondingly increase  our business and operating results will suffer 
we expect to continue to spend substantial financial and other resources on developing and introducing new services  and on expanding our sales and marketing organization and our network infrastructure 
we base our expense levels in part on our expectations of future revenue levels 
if our revenue for a particular quarter is lower than we expect  we may be unable to reduce proportionately our operating expenses for that quarter  in which case our operating results for that quarter would suffer 
our sales cycle makes it difficult to predict our quarterly revenues 
we sometimes have a long sales cycle because of the need to educate potential customers regarding the benefits of web communications services 
our sales cycle varies depending on the size and type of customer contemplating a purchase 
potential customers frequently need to obtain approvals from multiple decision makers within their organization and may evaluate competing products and services prior to deciding to use our services 
our sales cycle  which can range from several weeks to several months or more  makes it difficult to predict the quarter in which use of our services may begin 
this difficulty  in turn  affects our ability to predict future quarterly revenues 
most of our customers do not have long term obligations to purchase our services  therefore  our revenue and operating results could decline if our customers do not continue to use our services 
almost all of our customer contracts have initial terms of three to months 
these contracts are typically automatically renewed except where customers take action to cancel them prior to the end of an initial or renewal term 
notice lost subscription mrr  or an internal measurement tool we use to evaluate subscription based revenues we have lost  for december was 
in addition to cancellation  a customer may stop buying our services directly from us and instead start purchasing our services from one of our resellers 
or a customer may change the number of ports or types of services that the customer purchases directly from us such that the overall revenue to us is lower 
the reasons why a customer would cancel use of our services have included the failure of the customer s employees to learn about and use our services  the failure of the services to meet the customer s expectations or requirements  financial difficulties experienced by the customer  or the customer s decision to use services or products offered by a competitor 
we may not obtain a sufficient amount of new or incremental business to compensate for any customers that we may lose 
the loss of existing customers or our failure to obtain additional customers would harm our business and operating results 
our business and operating results may suffer if we fail to establish distribution relationships  if our distribution partners do not successfully market and sell our services  or if we fail to become a significant participant in the telecommunications provider distribution channel 
as of december   we had distribution agreements in place with approximately distribution partners  which include both telecommunications partners and software vendors 
for the year ended december   we generated approximately of our revenue from our distribution partners  which revenue consisted of initial set up fees  commitment payments  and service fees 
the majority of the payments received from our distribution partners are per minute or usage based payments 
the minority of payments are fixed fee payments and are initially recorded as deferred revenue because we defer revenue related to initial set up fees received at the beginning of the relationship and record revenue from subscription services over the course of the service period as the distribution partner resells our services 
we also do not recognize commitment fees as revenue until the co mmitment fee is paid and fully earned by the use of services by the reseller s end user customers or forfeiture of the commitment at the end of the commitment period 
we cannot anticipate the amount of 
table of contents revenue we will derive from these relationships in the future 
we must continue to establish and extend these distribution partnerships 
establishing these distribution relationships can take as long as several months or more 
it typically also takes several months before our distribution arrangements generate significant revenue 
our distribution partners are not prohibited from offering and reselling the products and services of our competitors and may choose to devote insufficient resources to marketing and supporting our services or to devote greater resources to marketing and supporting the products and services of other companies 
also  with regard to the potentially economically significant telecommunications provider distribution channel for web conferencing services  our web conferencing competitors may be more successful in partnering with telecommunications providers  or telecommunications providers may independently enter the web conferencing business  either alone or with web conferencing vendors that do not include us 
if we fail to establish new distribution relationships in a timely manner  if our distribution partners do not successfully distribute our services  if we lose existing distribution partners for whatever reason or if we fail to become a significant participant in the telecommunications provider distribution channel  our ability to achieve market acceptance of our web communications services will suffer and our business and operating results will be harmed 
our total revenue may suffer if we are unable to successfully manage our distribution relationships to prevent the undercutting of our direct sales efforts 
we sell our services directly to customers and also indirectly through our distribution partners 
we enter into distribution relationships so that we can increase total revenue by acquiring customers through distribution partners that we could not acquire through our direct sales efforts 
under our agreements with our distribution partners  either webex or the distribution partner bills the end user customers 
when webex bills the end user  a percentage of the proceeds generated from the distribution partner s sale of webex services is paid to the distribution partner and the remainder is retained by webex 
when the distribution partner bills the end user  webex sells the services on a discounted basis to the distribution partner  which in turn marks up the price and sells the services to the end user 
in either case  webex does not benefit as much financially  for the same vo lume of webex service sold  than it would if the sale were made by webex directly  without the contribution of the distribution partner  due to the revenue sharing arrangement or purchase discount given to the distribution partner 
to the extent that sales of our services by our distribution partners are sales that  absent the existence of the distribution arrangement  would be made by our direct sales force  our sales revenue may decrease 
although we make efforts to minimize conflict in our sales channel between our direct sales force and our distribution partners  our distribution partners may inadvertently compete with our direct sales force for new customers of our services 
additionally  to the extent our existing customers discontinue direct agreements with webex in order to purchase our services from distribution partners  our revenue may decrease 
we expect to depend on sales of our webex meeting center service for the majority of our revenue for the foreseeable future 
our webex meeting center service accounted for approximately of our revenue for the year ended december  although we have recently experienced growth in sales of our newer services  such as our event center formerly onstage  training center and support center services  these newer services may not provide significant revenue in the future 
if we are not successful in developing  deploying and selling new services  our operating results will suffer 
if our services fail to function when used by large numbers of participants  we may lose customers and our business and reputation may be harmed 
our business strategy requires that our services be able to accommodate large numbers of meetings and users at any one time 
our data network monitoring system measures the capacity of our data network by bandwidth use 
the goal of our network capacity planning is to have each day s peak usage be less than of our data network capacity 
from time to time daily peak usage exceeds of data network capacity 
however  since mid we have been able to maintain average daily peak usage at under of our data network capacity by adding capacity whenever there is a trend toward increased average daily peak usage 
during the year ended december   the average of our daily peak usages  as a percentage of our data network capacity  was less than 
in addition to our data network  we also maintain an integrated telephony network for which capacity planning is necessar y 
if we fail to increase capacity in our data and telephony networks consistent with the growth in usage of each  the performance of these networks could be adversely impacted 
in addition  we may encounter performance problems when making upgrades and modifications to either or both of these networks 
if our services do not perform adequately because of capacity related problems with either or both of our data and telephony networks  particularly our data network  we may lose customers and be unable to attract new customers and our operating results could suffer 
if our marketing  branding and lead generation efforts are not successful  our business may be harmed 

table of contents we believe that continued marketing and brand recognition efforts will be critical to achieve widespread acceptance of our web communications services 
our marketing and advertising campaigns or branding efforts may not be successful given the expense required 
for example  certain sales promotion initiatives  such as free trial use  may dampen short term sales even as such initiatives attempt to cultivate participants desire to purchase and use our services  in that a customer who might have otherwise purchased our services will instead receive free use for the trial period of time 
in addition  failure to adequately generate and develop sales leads could cause our future revenue growth to decrease 
also  our ability to generate and cultivate sales leads into large organizations  where there is the pote ntial for significant use of our services and where any future marketplace standardization of our service might emerge  could have a material effect on our business 
there is no assurance that we will identify  and if we identify then secure  the number of strategic sales leads necessary to help generate standardized marketplace acceptance of our services  or to maintain rate of revenue growth we have experienced in the past 
if our marketing  branding or lead generation efforts are not successful  our business and operating results will be harmed 
we rely on our china subsidiary  which exposes us to risks of economic instability in china and risks related to political tension between china and the united states 
prior to february  a significant portion of our development and testing activity was conducted by three companies in china which are owned by our president and chief technical officer  min zhu  and his spouse 
in february  our subsidiary webex china purchased substantially all of the assets of these three companies and hired from these companies a substantial percentage of their employees 
since february we have relied  and for the foreseeable future we plan to continue to rely  on webex china to conduct a significant portion of our quality assurance testing and software development activities  and also a number of other activities including lead research for our sales personnel  creation of technical documentation  preparation of marketing materials and the provisioning of customer web sites 
webex has four facilities in china  located in each of hefei  hongzhou  sh anghai and suzhou 
our reliance on webex china for a significant portion of our quality assurance  software development and other activities exposes us to a variety of economic and political risks including  but not limited to  technology development restrictions  potentially costly and pro employee labor laws and regulations governing our employees in china  and travel restrictions 
the loss of our webex china development  testing and other support activities may cause our costs to increase 
in addition  political and economic tensions between the united states and china could harm our ability to conduct operations in china  which could increase our operating costs and harm our business and operations 
a significant recurrence of sars in china  or the spread of avian flu within china  could adversely affect our subsidiary webex china s operational activities 
in the first quarter of  the world became aware of the existence of a highly contagious disease known as severe acute respiratory syndrome  or sars 
according to reputable media reports  current medical knowledge about sars is that sars has no cure or vaccine  can significantly debilitate its victims for several days or weeks and is estimated to cause death in approximately five to fifteen percent of cases 
the sars outbreak  which had its greatest impact in china  appears to have been contained for the present 
in addition to sars  there has been a mild outbreak of avian or bird flu  a reportedly fatal disease in a minority of contracted cases  in china and neighboring countries 
if sars significantly recurs in china  or if avian flu spreads significantly within china  webex china s business operations could suffer and our business cou ld be harmed 
we could incur unexpected costs resulting from claims relating to use of our services 
many of the business interactions supported by our services are critical to our customers businesses 
although it is not standard practice for us to do so  in some situations we do make warranties in our customer agreements as to service uptime  or the percentage of time that our network will be operational and available for customer use 
accordingly  any failure by us to fulfill such warranty obligation  or more generally any failure in a customer s business interaction or other communications activity that is caused or allegedly caused by our services  could result in a claim for damages against us  regardless of our responsibility for the failure  and cause us to incur unexpected costs 
our customers and end users may use our services to share confidential and sensitive information  and if our system security is breached  our reputation could be harmed and we may lose customers 
our customers and end users may use our services to share confidential and sensitive information  the security of which is critical to their business 
third parties may attempt to breach our security or that of our customers 
we may be liable to our customers for any breach in security  and any breach could harm our reputation and cause us to lose customers 
in addition  computers are vulnerable to computer 
table of contents viruses  physical or electronic break ins and similar disruptions  which could lead to interruptions  delays or loss of data 
we may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to further protect against security breaches or to resolve problems caused by any breach  including litigation related expenses if we are sued 
the software underlying our services is complex  and our business and reputation could suffer if our services fail to perform properly due to undetected errors or similar problems with our underlying software 
complex software  such as the software underlying our services  often contains undetected errors 
we may be forced to delay commercial release of our services until problems are corrected and  in some cases  may need to implement enhancements to correct errors that we do not detect until after deployment of our services 
if we do detect an error in our software before we introduce new versions of our services  we might have to limit our services for an extended period of time while we resolve the problem 
in addition  problems with the software underlying our services could result in damage to our reputation  damage to our efforts to build brand awareness  loss of or delay in revenue  delays in or loss of market acceptance of our services  and unexpected expenses and diversion of resources to remedy errors 
if our services do not work with the many hardware and software platforms used by our customers and end users  our business may be harmed 
we currently serve customers and end users that use a wide variety of constantly changing hardware and software applications and platforms 
if our services are unable to support these platforms  they may fail to gain broad market acceptance  which would cause our operating results to suffer 
our success depends on our ability to deliver our services to multiple platforms and existing  or legacy  systems and to modify our services and underlying technology as new versions of applications are introduced 
in addition  the success of our services depends on our ability to anticipate and support new standards  especially web standards 
we license third party technologies  and if we cannot continue to license these or alternate technologies in a timely manner and on commercially reasonable terms  our business could suffer 
we intend to continue to license technologies from third parties  including applications used in our research and development activities and technology  which is integrated into our services 
for example  we license database  operating system and server software  and font rendering technology 
these third party technologies  and any that we may utilize in the future  may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms 
in addition  we may fail to successfully integrate any licensed technology into our services 
this in turn could harm our business and operating results 
our recent growth has placed a strain on our infrastructure and resources  and if we fail to manage our future growth to meet customer and distribution partner requirements  both within the us and internationally  our business could suffer 
we have experienced a period of rapid expansion in our personnel  facilities  and infrastructure that has placed a significant strain on our resources 
for example  our worldwide headcount increased from at december  to  at december  excluding personnel located in china  personnel increased from at december  to at december  our webex china personnel headcount has increased from employees at march  to employees at december  we expect continued increases in our personnel during our expansion has placed  and we expect that it will continue to place  a significant strain on our management  operational and financial resources 
in addition  we are in the process of updating some of our information technology infrastructure to meet increased requirements for capacity  flexibility and efficiency resulting fro m the growth of our business 
in the event these updated systems do not meet our requirements or are not deployed in a timely manner  our business may suffer 
any failure by us to manage our growth effectively could disrupt our operations or delay execution of our business plan and could consequently harm our business 

table of contents if we lose the services of subrah s 
iyar  our chief executive officer  or min zhu  our president and chief technical officer  our business may be harmed 
our success will depend on our senior executives 
in particular  the loss of the services of our chief executive officer and co founder  subrah s 
iyar  or our president  chief technical officer and co founder  min zhu  would harm our business 
we do not have long term employment agreements with or life insurance policies on any of our senior executives 
if we are unable to attract  integrate and retain qualified personnel  our business could suffer 
our future success will depend on our ability to attract  train  retain and motivate highly skilled engineering  technical  managerial  sales and marketing and customer support personnel 
during the months ended december   we hired approximately new employees worldwide  including approximately who have been hired by webex china since february we expect to continue to increase our personnel in in the past  we have had difficulty hiring qualified personnel as quickly as we have desired 
in particular  we have had difficulty hiring a sufficient number of qualified technical  development and support personnel 
although economic conditions in made hiring of personnel easier  we do not know what future labor market conditions will be 
if we encounter difficulty hiring  integrating and retaining a sufficient number of qualified personnel in the future  the quality of our web communications services and our ability to develop new services  obtain new customers and provide a high level of customer service could all suffer  and consequently the health of our overall business could suffer 
in addition  if we hire employees from our competitors  these competitors may claim that we have engaged in unfair hiring practices 
we could incur substantial costs in defending ourselves against any of these claims  regardless of their merits 
interruption or malfunction of our internal business processing systems  including a new system we plan to install during  could disrupt the services we provide our customers and could harm our business 
our business  with its over  customers and large number of daily transactions  is substantially dependent on the continuous and error free functioning of our automated business processing systems covering such areas as order entry  billing  contract management and collection activities 
we are planning to install  during the second quarter of  a comprehensive new business processing system to capture  and record for billing and financial statement generation purposes  customer usage of our various services 
any material interruption or malfunction of one or more such systems  including bugs  start up problems or other malfunctions relating to the new system  could cause delays or errors in transaction processing  could negatively affect customer relationships  and could harm our business interruptions in either our internal or outsourced computer and communications systems  including any relating to our transitioning our network switching infrastructure to a new building we have recently purchased  could reduce our ability to provide our revenue generating services and could harm our business and reputation 
the success of our web communications services depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our internal and outsourced computer and communications hardware and software systems 
we anticipate installing an updated version of our server management system during  which system monitors and reports on the status of our various servers through which our real time web communications services are delivered to customers 
any system failure  including the malfunction of the new server management system that causes an interruption in our web communications services or a decrease in their performance  could harm our relationships with our customers and distribution partners 
in addition  some of our communications hardware and software are hosted at third party co location facilities 
these systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from human error  tele communications failures  physical or remote break ins  sabotage  computer viruses and intentional acts of vandalism 
in addition  third party co location facilities may discontinue their operations due to poor business performance 
because a substantial part of our central computer and communications hardware and network operations are located in the san francisco bay area  an earthquake or other natural disaster could impair the performance of our entire network 
in the event of damage to or interruption of our internal or outsourced systems  if we are unable to implement our disaster recovery plans or our efforts to restore our services to normal levels in a timely manner are not successful  our business would suffer 
in addition  business interruption insurance may not adequately compensate us for losses that may occur 
finally  in february  we purchased approximately nine acres of real property in mountain view  california on which resides a building which we intend to use primarily as a switching c enter facility to accommodate growing usage requirements on our webex mediatone network 
any malfunction or service interruption we suffer in transitioning our network switching operations to the new building could disrupt our communications services  could harm our relationships with our customers and distribution partners  and could harm our business 

table of contents we might have liability for content or information transmitted through our communications services 
claims may be asserted against us for defamation  negligence  copyright  patent or trademark infringement and other legal theories based on the nature and content of the materials transmitted through our web communications services 
defending against such claims could be expensive  could be time consuming and could divert management s attention away from running our business 
in addition  any imposition of liability could harm our reputation and our business and operating results  or could result in the imposition of criminal penalties 
our success depends upon the patent protection of our software and technology 
our success and ability to compete depend to a significant degree upon the protection of our underlying software and our proprietary technology through patents 
we regard the effective protection of patentable inventions as important to our future opportunities 
we currently have ten issued patents  including six we have acquired from presenter  inc in connection with our june acquisition of certain assets of presenter 
our patents are in several areas including peer to peer connections to facilitate conferencing  document annotation  optimizing data transfer  and graphical user interface for extracting video presentations 
we currently have patent applications pending in the united states including eight patent applications assigned to us in the presenter asset acquisition transaction 
we may seek additional patents in the future 
our current patent applications cover dif ferent aspects of the technology used to deliver our services and are important to our ability to compete 
however  it is possible that any patents acquired by or issued to us may not be broad enough to protect us  any issued patent could be successfully challenged by one or more third parties  which could result in our loss of the right to prevent others from exploiting the inventions claimed in those patents  current and future competitors may independently develop similar technology  duplicate our services or design around any of our patents  our pending patent applications may not result in the issuance of patents  and effective patent protection  including effective legal enforcement mechanisms against those who violate our patent related assets  may not be available in every country in which we do business 
we also rely upon trademarks  copyrights and trade secrets to protect our technology  which may not be sufficient to protect our intellectual property 
we also rely on a combination of laws  such as copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  and contractual restrictions  such as confidentiality agreements and licenses  to establish and protect our technology 
our trademarks include activetouch  webex word and design  webex bifurcated ball design  webex power button design  webex 
com  mywebex  bringing the meeting to you  mediatone  meeting center  webex meeting center  event center  webex sound mark  meeting enable your web site  we ve got to start meeting like this  powering real time business meetings  and one button  infinite power 
federal trademark applications acquired from presenter consist of the trademarks ipresenter  ipresentation and instant presentation 
we also refer to trademarks of other corporations and organizations in this document 
also  our software is automatically protected by copyright law 
these fo rms of intellectual property protection are critically important to our ability to establish and maintain our competitive position 
however  third parties may infringe or misappropriate our copyrights  trademarks and similar proprietary rights  laws and contractual restrictions may not be sufficient to prevent misappropriation of our technology or to deter others from developing similar technologies  effective trademark  copyright and trade secret protection  including effective legal enforcement mechanisms against those who violate our trademark  copyright or trade secret assets  may be unavailable or limited in foreign countries  other companies may claim common law trademark rights based upon state or foreign laws that precede the federal registration of our marks  and 
table of contents policing unauthorized use of our services and trademarks is difficult  expensive and time consuming  and we may be unable to determine the extent of any unauthorized use 
reverse engineering  unauthorized copying or other misappropriation of our proprietary technology could enable third parties to benefit from our technology without paying us for it  which would significantly harm our business 
we may face intellectual property infringement claims that could be costly to defend and result in our loss of significant rights 
we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims  including claims of alleged infringement of the copyrights  trademarks and patents of third parties 
our services may infringe issued patents 
in addition  we may be unaware of filed patent applications which have not yet been made public and which relate to our services 
from time to time  we have received notices alleging that we infringe intellectual property rights of third parties 
in such cases  we investigate the relevant facts  respond to the allegations and  where case facts and other conditions warrant  consider settlement options 
for example  in march  we received a letter from a company alleging that we infringed several of that company s patents 
we reviewed the company s allegations and other relevant patents and publications and responded by providing arguments and materials supporting our position th at we do not infringe the cited patents and that the patents are invalid 
we have had subsequent communications with the other company regarding this matter 
this or other intellectual property claims that may be asserted against us in the future could result in litigation 
intellectual property litigation is expensive and time consuming and could divert management s attention away from running our business 
intellectual property litigation could also require us to develop non infringing technology or enter into royalty or license agreements 
these royalty or license agreements  if required  may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all  in the event of a successful claim of infringement 
our failure or inability to develop non infringing technology or license proprietary rights on a timely basis would harm our business 
we may engage in future acquisitions or investments that could dilute the ownership of our existing stockholders  cause us to incur significant expenses  fail to complement our existing revenue models or harm our operating results 
we may acquire or invest in complementary businesses  technologies or services 
for example  in june we acquired certain assets of presenter  inc  a transaction which has not had a material impact on our financial statements  and in december we announced that we had signed a definitive agreement to acquire cyberbazaar in a transaction expected to close during the first quarter of integrating any newly acquired businesses  employees  technologies or services may be expensive and time consuming 
to finance any material acquisitions  it may be necessary for us to raise additional funds through public or private financings 
additional funds may not be available on terms that are favorable to us and  in the case of equity financings as with acquisitions made with our stock  may result in dilution to our stockholders 
we may be unable to complete any acquisitions or inve stments on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
even if completed  we may be unable to operate any acquired businesses profitably or successfully integrate the employees  technology  products or services of any acquired businesses into our existing business 
in the case of the presenter asset acquisition transaction  we hired most of the presenter employees and are offering certain presenter services as add ons to our current webex service offerings 
however  those sales may not prove financially significant  and if we pursue alternative product integration strategies with regard to the acquired presenter assets and technologies we may not experience significant financial success 
if we are unable to integrate any newly acquired entities or technologies effectively  including those related to our presenter asset acquisition  our operating results could suffer 
future acquisitions by us could also result in large and immediate write downs  or incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities  any of which wo uld harm our operating results 
we must compete successfully in the web communications services market 
the market for web communications services is intensely competitive  subject to rapid change and is significantly affected by new product and service introductions and other market activities of industry participants 
although we do not currently compete against any one entity with respect to all aspects of our services  we do compete with various companies in regards to specific elements of our web communications services 
for example  we compete with providers of traditional communications technologies such as teleconferencing and videoconferencing  applications software and tools companies  and web conferencing services such as centra software  genesys  raindance  ibm  oracle  macromedia  and microsoft 
in addition  in january  cisco systems  inc acquired latitude communications  a competitor of webex 
other companies could choose to extend their products and services to i nclude interactive communications in the future 
many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories  significantly greater financial  technical and other resources and greater name recognition than we do 
our current and future competitors maybe able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
in addition  current and potential competitors have established  and may in the future establish  cooperative relationships with third parties and with each other to increase the availability of their products and 
table of contents services to the marketplace 
competitive pressures could reduce our market share or require us to reduce the price of our services  either of which could harm our business and operating results 
for example  we offer voice over internet protocol voip to customers seeking that option for the audio portion of their web conferencing service purchase  which puts us in competition with increasing numbers of low cost providers of voip products and services of ever increasing quality 
one or more of these competitors may offer a sufficiently low cost  feature attractive  audio centric voip offering that  though not a web conferencing offering  might divert business away from us  or one or more of these competitors might themselves leverage their experience in the voip segment of web communications to develop and market a web conferencing product or service of their own 
finally  our reve nues and market share could also be reduced if  during this time period where the market is still relatively new and competitors are still emerging  we do not capitalize on our current market leadership by timely developing and executing corporate strategies that will increase the likelihood that our services will be accepted as the market standard in preference to the offerings of our current and future competitors 
microsoft may become a formidable competitor in the web communications market 
in april  microsoft announced that it had completed its acquisition of our competitor placeware 
microsoft is currently offering the placeware delivered web conferencing service under the name microsoft office live meeting 
office live meeting is a feature of the new microsoft office system  a suite of software application products that was launched during late as a result of its acquisition of placeware and of its marketing of the office live meeting service  microsoft could become a far more active and significant competitor in the specific interactive communications markets that we currently serve 
microsoft may devote greater technical and marketing resources to the web communications market than it has in the past 
for example  microsoft could invest a significant amount of financial and technical resources in improving the office live meeting offering  could more e xtensively integrate office live meeting within past  present and future versions of the microsoft office software product  could extend the capability of its other products to include capabilities more directly competitive with webex  or could develop entirely new web communications technologies 
in addition  microsoft could seek to leverage its dominant market position in the operating system  productivity application or browser market to expand its presence in the web communications market  which may make it difficult for other vendors  such as webex  to compete 
for example  if microsoft were to successfully integrate a web communications capability into a future operating system software product  our revenues and business could be significantly negatively affected 
while we believe that our current market leadership in web conferencing is in part due to the technologies and strategies we have employed in building our web communications network and offering web communications as a service  we may not be able to continue to maintain our market leadership in the web conferencing market if microsoft aggressively pursues this market 
microsoft s competitive activity in the web communications market could have a significantly harmful effect on our business 
our future success depends on the broad market adoption and acceptance of web communications services 
the market for web communications services is relatively new and rapidly evolving 
market demand for communications services over the web is uncertain 
if the market for web communications services does not grow  our business and operating results will be harmed 
factors that might influence market acceptance of our services include the following  all of which are beyond our control willingness of businesses and end users to use web communications services for websites  the growth of the web and commercial on line services  the willingness of our distribution partners to integrate web communications services for websites in their service offerings  and the ongoing level of security and reliability for conducting business over the web 
our success depends on the continued growth of web usage and the continued growth in reliability and capacity of the internet 
because customers access our network through the web  our revenue growth depends on the continued development and maintenance of the internet infrastructure 
this continued development of the web would include maintenance of a reliable network with the necessary speed  data capacity and security  as well as timely development of complementary products and services  including high speed modems and other high bandwidth communications technologies  for providing reliable  high performance internet access and services 
because global commerce on the web and the on line exchange of information is new and evolving  we cannot predict whether the 
table of contents web will continue to be a viable commercial marketplace over the long term 
the success of our business will rely on the continued improvement of the web as a convenient and reliable means of customer interaction and commerce  as well as an efficient medium for the delivery and distribution of information by businesses to their employees 
if increases in web usage or the continued growth in reliability and capacity of the internet fail to materialize  our ability to deliver our services may be adversely affected and our operating results could suffer 
we face risks associated with government regulation of the internet  and related legal uncertainties 
currently  few existing laws or regulations specifically apply to the internet  other than laws generally applicable to businesses 
many internet related laws and regulations  however  are pending and may be adopted in the united states  in individual states and local jurisdictions and in other countries 
these laws may relate to many areas that impact our business  including encryption  network and information security  the convergence of traditional communication services  such as telephone services  with internet communications  taxes and wireless networks 
these types of regulations could differ between countries and other political and geographic divisions both inside and outside the united states 
non us countries and political organizations may impose  or favor  more and different regulation than that which has been proposed in the united states  thus furthering the comple xity of regulation 
in addition  state and local governments within the united states may impose regulations in addition to  inconsistent with  or stricter than federal regulations 
the adoption of such laws or regulations  and uncertainties associated with their validity  interpretation  applicability and enforcement  may affect the available distribution channels for  and the costs associated with  our products and services 
the adoption of such laws and regulations may harm our business 
current and future economic and political conditions may adversely affect our business 
economic growth in the united states and throughout most of the world continues to be slow  though there are signs that at least in the us  economic growth may be increasing at a modestly higher rate than in the recent past 
nevertheless  it is still uncertain when economic conditions will improve on a sustained basis 
in addition  the residual effects of war in iraq  uncertainty about iraq s political future and continuing tensions throughout the middle east remain a risk to the domestic economy and may impact the supply and price of petroleum products  which may in turn negatively impact the world economy 
moreover  the prospect of future terrorists attacks in the united states and elsewhere may have a further negative impact on the economy 
in particular  the technology and telecommunications sectors continue to languish in an economic downturn more pronounced than that o f the broader us and world economies 
if economic conditions worsen as a result of economic  political or social turmoil or military conflict  or if there are further terrorist attacks in the united states or elsewhere  our customers may not be able to pay for our services and our distribution partners may cease operations  which may harm our operating results 
we may experience power blackouts and higher electricity prices as a result of pg e business practices or circumstances  or electrical system failures whether accidentally or intentionally caused  which could disrupt our operations and increase our expenses 
california has experienced  and could in the future experience  energy price increases  energy shortages  and blackouts 
the major northern california public utility that supplies electric power to our northern california corporate and data center headquarters is pacific gas electric company pg e 
pg e continues to operate under the protection of chapter of the federal bankruptcy act 
the resolution of this bankruptcy proceeding may affect the future pricing policies of pg e  including under what circumstances and to what extent pg e will be able to impose energy price increases 
in addition  as was made evident by the well publicized august blackout which simultaneously affected several eastern us states for a period exceeding hours  a similarly widespread  long lasting power outage could occur in northern california 
as with the ea stern us power supply  an important source of electrical power to northern california consists of a multi state grid situated in the western united states 
an accidental interruption of  or criminal disruption to  a key supply or distribution component of the power grid could cause a significant power outage in northern california 
if power outages or energy price increases occur in the future in northern california or other locations where we maintain operations  such events could disrupt our operations  prevent us from providing our services  harm our reputation  and result in a loss of revenue and increase in our expenses  all of which could substantially harm our business and results of operations 
the existence of equity based compensation  along with possible future regulatory action or standard setting requiring the reporting of employee stock options as an expense item  will negatively impact earnings 
as of december   we had approximately million in deferred equity based compensation 
this expense will generally be amortized over a two year period and will result in a decrease in earnings or an increase in losses 
we expect the amount of equity based compensation expense to decrease over time as a result of the vesting of options granted prior to our initial public offering 
however  the 
table of contents amount of future equity based compensation expense related to the unvested portion of option grants to non employees or related to modification of existing employee grants will fluctuate with our stock price  and  accordingly  the amount of future equity based compensation expense is difficult to predict 
in and  we granted stock options at exercise prices significantly lower than the deemed fair value  which has contributed to our equity based compensation expense 
the fasb is expected to change the way stock options will be reported by public companies  and  although the timing and reporting methodology associated with these changes have not been determined at this time  it is anticipated that the new fasb rules will be effective by january  this change in accounting standards may require us to report stock options for employees as an expense  and our net income may be negatively impacted 
our stock price has been and will likely continue to be volatile because of stock market fluctuations that affect the prices of technology stocks 
a decline in our stock price could result in securities class action litigation against us that could divert management s attention and harm our business 
our stock price has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile 
for example  between january  and february   our stock price has traded as high as on february   and as low as on april  our stock price could fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors  including variations in our actual or anticipated operating results  sales of substantial amounts of our stock  announcements by or about us or our competitors  including technological innovation  new products  services or acquisitions  litigation and other developments relating to our patents or other proprietary rights or those of our competitors  conditions in the internet industry  governmental regulation and legislation  and changes in securities analysts estimates of our performance  or our failure to meet analysts expectations 
many of these factors are beyond our control 
in addition  the stock markets in general  and the nasdaq national market and the market for internet technology companies in particular  continue to experience significant price and volume fluctuations 
these fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies 
these broad market and industry factors may decrease the market price of our common stock  regardless of our actual operating performance 
in the past  companies that have experienced volatility in the market prices of their stock have been the objects of securities class action litigation 
if we were to be the object of securities class action litigation  we could face substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources  which could harm our business 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk 
a small  but growing  part of our business is conducted outside the united states 
these services are generally priced in the local currency 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
when the amount of revenue obtained from sources outside the united states becomes significant  we may engage in hedging activities or other actions to decrease fluctuations in operating results due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rate risk 
we do not use derivative financial instruments or market risk sensitive instruments 
instead  we invest in highly liquid investments with short maturities 
accordingly  we do not expect any material loss from these investments and believe that our potential interest rate exposure is not material
