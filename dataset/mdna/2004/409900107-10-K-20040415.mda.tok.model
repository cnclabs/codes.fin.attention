item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview hancock fabrics  inc is a retail and wholesale merchant of fabric and related home sewing and decorating accessories 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the recorded amount of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the period 
significant accounting policies employed by hancock  including the use of estimates and assumptions  are presented in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
management bases its estimates on its historical experience  together with other relevant factors  in order to form the basis for making judgments  which will affect the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and makes changes to carrying values as deemed necessary 
hancock believes that estimates related to the following areas involve a higher degree of judgment and or complexity inventories 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market  cost is determined by the lifo method 
as with other retailers  it is not practical to perform physical inventory counts for all stores on the last day of a period  therefore  certain assumptions must be made in order to record cost of sales and the related change in inventory for the period of time from each store s most recent physical count to the end of the period 
although  under certain circumstances  actual results could prove to be materially different from the estimates used  hancock has consistently used the same methodology throughout its existence with dependable results  and management believes that such methodology provides an inventory valuation which results in carrying inventory at the lower of cost or market 
insurance reserves 
workers compensation  general liability and employee medical insurance programs are largely self insured 
it is hancock s policy to record its self insurance liabilities using estimates of claims incurred but not yet reported or paid  based on historical trends and other relevant factors 
actual results can vary from estimates for many reasons including  among others  future inflation rates  claim settlement patterns  litigation trends and legal interpretations 
store closing reserves 
store closing reserves include estimates for net lease obligations and other store closing costs 
hancock recognizes store closing reserves at fair value in the period that an operating lease is considered terminated and a liability has been incurred in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
adjustments to store closing reserves are made  as necessary  in the period that events or circumstances requiring such reserve adjustments occur 
pension and postretirement benefit obligations 
the value of assets and liabilities associated with pension and postretirement benefits is determined on an actuarial basis 
these values are affected by the market value of plan assets and estimates of the expected return on plan assets and assumed discount rates 
hancock determines the discount rates using changes in the rates of high quality  fixed income investments 
actual changes in the fair market value of plan assets  differences between the actual return and the expected return on plan assets and changes in the discount rate used affect the amount of pension expense recognized 
hancock expects pension and postretirement benefit expenses to decrease by approximately  during our pension and postretirement plans are further described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
valuation of long lived assets 
hancock periodically reviews the net realizable value of long lived assets at the individual store level whenever events and circumstances indicate impairment has occurred 
in the event that the carrying values of long lived assets are in excess of estimated gross future cash flows for those assets  the values of the assets are written down to a level commensurate with a discounted cash flow analysis of the estimated future cash flows 
goodwill 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles is no longer amortized 
on an annual basis  the fair value of hancock s reporting units are compared with their carrying values 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  hancock would recognize the difference as an impairment charge 
the fair value of the reporting unit is estimated using the discounted present value of future cash flows 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  selected statement of income data expressed as a percentage of sales for the period indicated 
this table should be read in conjunction with the following discussion and with our consolidated financial statements  including the related notes 
fiscal year sales cost of goods sold gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization operating income interest expense  net earnings before income taxes income taxes net earnings and comprehensive income vs 
sales increased million in due to a increase in comparable stores sales 
during  hancock opened stores and closed stores  resulting in stores at year end 
the improvement in comparable store sales was primarily driven by a sales increase in our home decorating category  which accounted for of sales in and in our store within a store home decorating concept is now in place in of our store locations  and we are introducing a new program in to further grow this category by offering customers new value priced items 
comparable store sales in categories other than decorating were flat overall  with quilting  yarn and sewing machine sales rising  while fashion and special occasion fabric sales declined 
quilting has become one of our fastest growing product lines due in part to partnerships with exclusive suppliers and industry personalities which we plan to develop further in hancock s focus on teaching activities and product demonstrations in our stores also contributed to higher sales during the year 
gross margins increased to in from in as a result of product mix adjustments and the company s ability to better control promotional activities 
during  we continued to shift our merchandise mix towards higher margin home decorating products 
in addition  we focused on limiting significant promotional activities  which compromise gross margin  despite deep discounting activities by our competitors at various times during the year 
the increase in gross margin was partially offset  however  by a decrease in the lifo last in  first out credit from million in to million this year due to slightly less product cost deflation in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased to in from in  primarily due to costs associated with the relocation of our distribution operations to a new facility in baldwyn  mississippi 
for most of the year  hancock operated two distribution centers which caused us to incur duplicate expenses for items such as depreciation  insurance  utilities and maintenance 
the actual transfer of inventory  fixtures  equipment and systems between the two facilities also resulted in higher expenses for items such as payroll and transportation 
the relocation of the distribution operations was completed just after fiscal year end 
we expect to complete construction of our new offices and transfer the corporate functions to the baldwyn facility during the third quarter of normal selling  general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales were adversely impacted during by the absence of sales leverage on fixed expenses and a thousand pretax increase in pension expense due to negative returns on plan assets in recent years and a lower discount rate 
in addition  the expense comparison in was negatively influenced by a gain of thousand pretax on the sale of real estate in which was reflected as a reduction of expense 
interest expense increased due to higher average outstanding debt of million during versus million in the prior year 
the additional debt was primarily incurred to fund construction of the new distribution center and corporate offices 
the effect of higher borrowings was partially offset  however  by lower interest rates 
income tax expense decreased million in due to a reduction in pretax earnings from hancock s effective tax rate was in both years 
vs 
sales in increased million from due to an increase in comparable store sales  partially offset by having one less week in  which added million to sales in  and a decrease in the number of stores 
hancock opened stores and closed stores in  resulting in stores at year end 
comparable store sales benefited from the continued repositioning of the store base  the remerchandising of hancock s product mix and efforts to appeal to a more diverse customer base 
the store repositioning strategy has consisted of closing smaller  low potential stores that were often located too close together  while opening or acquiring larger stores spaced farther apart to better support an expanded product offering within hancock s core merchandise competency 
the store within a store home decorating concept introduced in late reached stores at year end  and the decorating category increased to of sales in  up from in gross margins were in both and the effect of adjustments to the lifo reserve  reflecting inflation or deflation in inventories  was to increase pretax earnings by million in and reduce pretax earnings in by thousand 
total selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales decreased to from in due to leverage from comparable store sales increases  improved store labor controls and a gain of thousand pretax on the sale of real estate in the third quarter 
such improvements were partially offset by rising employee health insurance and higher pension costs resulting from a three year weakness in investment returns 
during  pension expense was million higher than in the previous year due to the negative returns on plan assets and a reduction in the discount rate assumption 
interest expense decreased due to a reduced level of outstanding debt and lower interest rates throughout at year end  no borrowings were outstanding under hancock s credit facilities 
income tax expense increased by million in due to the improvement in pretax earnings over the effective tax rate was in both years 
liquidity and capital resources hancock has historically financed its operations with internally generated cash flow 
hancock maintains a strong financial position as evidenced by the following information as of the end of fiscal years  and dollars in thousands cash and cash equivalents    net cash flows provided used operating activites    investing activities    financing activites    working capital    long term indebtedness to total capitalization changes in cash and cash equivalents cash flows from operating activities in increased from the prior year due to a voluntary pension plan contribution of million made to improve the funding status of the plan 
the increase was partially offset by increases in inventory over levels due to the addition of new product lines  such as yarn and small furniture  and the expansion of our quilting category 
in addition  the company intentionally increased stock levels of high turn basic fabric and notion items in order to protect against any supply disruptions associated with the transfer of inventory to the new distribution center during the fourth quarter 
inventory levels for these high turn items are expected to recede to normal levels in a relatively short time 
cash used for investing activities increased over the prior year due to capital expenditures associated with the new headquarters distribution center and the installation of point of sale pos systems in stores 
cash used for financing activities increased from due to a decline in proceeds from stock option exercises  an increase in the cash dividend rate and a greater amount of treasury stock purchases  partially offset by borrowings of million 
over the past three years  cash flows from operations  together with proceeds from the exercise of stock options  were sufficient to allow hancock to repay million of debt  purchase almost million of property and equipment  pay over million of dividends and purchase more than million of treasury stock 
capital expenditures hancock s primary capital requirements are for the financing of inventories and  to a lesser extent  for capital expenditures relating to store locations and its distribution facility 
funds for such purposes are generated from hancock s operations and  if necessary  supplemented by borrowings from commercial lenders 
capital expenditures amounted to million in  million in and million in approximately million of the capital expenditures in were invested in the new distribution center  million in the implementation of pos systems  million in opening new stores and million in ongoing maintenance 
equity in prior years and continuing in  hancock has repurchased over million shares  or approximately of its outstanding stock 
hancock plans to use future cash in excess of operating needs and capital investment for the payment of cash dividends and the purchase of treasury stock  as market and financial conditions dictate 
in evaluating treasury stock purchases  consideration is given to overall liquidity issues related to hancock s stock 
as of february   a total of  shares were available for repurchase under hancock s most recent authorization 
bank credit facilities in addition to its operating cash flows  hancock has two revolving credit facilities available with three banks  which provide a total of million of borrowing capacity 
management believes the total of million is adequate for hancock s foreseeable needs in the near term 
as of february   hancock had outstanding debt of million under these revolving credit agreements 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the company s credit facilities 
general hancock estimates that capital expenditures for will approximate million 
anticipated expenditures include approximately million related to the completion of the new distribution center and corporate offices  million for implementation of pos in the remaining store locations  million for store openings and million for ongoing maintenance in existing stores  the distribution center and corporate offices 
internally generated funds supplemented by borrowings are expected to be sufficient to finance anticipated capital requirements in the near term 
off balance sheet arrangements hancock has no off balance sheet financing arrangements 
however  hancock does finance the use of its retail fabric locations under noncancelable operating leases 
since the terms of these arrangements meet the definition of operating leases  the sum of the future lease payments is not reflected on hancock s balance sheet 
such minimum rental payments are reflected in the table below 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table summarizes our future cash outflows resulting from contractual obligations and commitments as of february  in thousands less more than than contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt   minimum rental payments      standby lc for insurance   trade lc s   total      as disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements  hancock has arrangements that provide for up to million in letters of credit 
the company has no standby repurchase obligations or guarantees of other entities debt 
during the first quarter of  hancock entered into a cost plus contract for the construction of the company s new distribution center and corporate offices 
at february   hancock s remaining commitment is approximately million  which is expected to be disbursed during related party transactions hancock has no balances with any related parties  nor has it had any material transactions with related parties during the three year period reflected in the consolidated statements of income 
effects of inflation the impact of inflation on labor and occupancy costs can significantly affect hancock s operations 
many of hancock s employees are paid hourly rates related to federal and state minimum wage requirements  accordingly  any increases will affect hancock 
in addition  payroll taxes  employee benefits and other employee costs continue to increase 
health insurance costs  in particular  continue to rise at an unsettling rate in the united states each year  and higher employer contributions to hancock s pension plan have been necessary recently in light of weaker investment returns 
costs of leases for new store locations remain stable  but renewal costs of older leases continue to increase 
hancock believes the practice of maintaining adequate operating margins through a combination of price adjustments and cost controls  careful evaluation of occupancy needs and efficient purchasing practices are the most effective tools for coping with increased costs and expenses 
inflation is one of the key factors used in the calculation of the lifo charge or credit to cost of sales 
in  an increase in the producer price index  which more than offset the effect of inventory reductions  resulted in a lifo charge 
a deflationary trend in product costs in and more than offset inventory increases and caused a lifo credit 
seasonality hancock s business is slightly seasonal 
peak sales periods occur during the fall and pre easter weeks  while the lowest sales periods occur during the summer and the month of january 
forward looking statements this report contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the private litigation reform act of such statements are not historical facts and reflect the company s current views regarding matters such as operations and financial performance 
in general  forward looking statements are identified by such words or phrases as anticipates  believes  approximates  estimates  expects  intends or plans or the negative of those words or other terminology 
forward looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties  the company s actual results could differ materially from those expressed in our forward looking statements 
the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ from those expressed in our forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  those that are discussed below 
forward looking statements speak only as of the date made  and neither hancock fabrics nor its management undertakes any obligation to update or revise any forward looking statement 
competitive changes could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
although we are one of the largest fabric retailers in the united states and principally compete with only one national fabric craft store chain  a few small fabric chains and numerous independent fabric stores  changes in our competitive environment could adversely impact our operations 
such changes include  but are not limited to  the following liquidation of inventory in hancock s markets caused by a competitor store closure or need to dispose of inventory  new entrants into the retail fabric industry  expansion by existing competitors into our markets  and increased competitive pricing strategies 
adverse general economic factors can significantly impact our business 
general economic conditions that are beyond the company s control can adversely impact our operating results 
these factors include increased interest rates in periods of borrowings  consumer debt levels  tax rates and policies  unemployment trends  recession  inflation  deflation and other matters that effect consumer confidence and spending 
delays or interruptions in the flow of merchandise through our distribution center could adversely impact our operating results 
approximately two thirds of hancock s store shipments pass through the company s distribution center 
the remainder of merchandise is drop shipped by our vendors directly to our store locations 
damage or interruption to the distribution center from factors such as fire  power loss  storm damage or unanticipated supplier shipment delays could cause damage to our facility and or a disruption in our operations 
the occurrence of unanticipated problems at our distribution center would likely result in increased operating expenses and reduced sales which would negatively impact our operating results 
implementation of our point of sale system could create disruptions in the operations of our stores 
we are in the process of installing a point of sale system to all stores which we believe is extremely important in the management of our business 
disruptions  if any  experienced in connection with the implementation of the new system could have a materially adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
a disruption in the performance of our information systems could occur 
we depend on our management information systems for many aspects of our business 
our operations and financial performance would be materially adversely affected if our management information systems are disrupted or if we are unable to maintain  upgrade or expand our systems 
we are vulnerable to risks associated with obtaining merchandise from foreign suppliers 
hancock relies to a material extent on foreign suppliers for various products 
in addition  some of our domestic suppliers manufacture their products overseas or purchase them from foreign vendors 
political or financial instability  trade restrictions  tariffs  currency exchange rates  transport capacity and costs and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control and could adversely impact our operating results 
a weak fourth quarter would materially adversely affect our operating results for the year 
like many retailers  the company s strongest quarter in terms of sales  net earnings and cash flow is the fourth quarter 
if  for any reason  our fourth quarter results were substantially below expectations  our operating results for the full year would be negatively impacted  and we could have substantial excess inventory that could be difficult to liquidate
