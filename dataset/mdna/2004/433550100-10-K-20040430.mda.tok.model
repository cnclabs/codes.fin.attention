general the company is a leading single source supplier of electronic computer controlled embroidery machinery and related value added products and services to the embroidery industry 
the company offers a complete line of technologically advanced single and multi head embroidery machines  proprietary application software and a diverse line of embroidery supplies and accessories 
hirsch believes its comprehensive customer service  user training  software support through pulse and broad product offerings combine to place the company in a competitive position within its marketplace 
the company sells embroidery machines manufactured by tajima and tui  as well as a wide variety of embroidery supplies  microcomputers manufactured by dell computer corporation and software manufactured by pulse 
in fiscal hirsch formed tui for the purpose of assembling tajima embroidery machines in the united states 
production at tui consists of models in configurations of up to eight heads per machine 
in january tokai industries tajima s manufacturing arm purchased a percent interest in tui 
in july tajima granted to hirsch the non exclusive right to distribute to its existing us customers who have expanded their operations into the caribbean region 
as of january   the company sold its majority interest in tui to tajima industries 
the company grew rapidly from the time of its initial public offering through fiscal growth during this period was fueled by rapid technological advances in software and hardware  the strong demand for embroidered products  the creation of new embroidery applications and the strength of the embroidery entrepreneur as a growing segment of the marketplace 
the company believes that the purchasers of smaller embroidery machines are a significant source of repeat business for the sale of multi head embroidery machines as the entrepreneurs operations expand 
the trend toward retrenchment driven by the relocation and continued investment offshore of large multi head equipment customers has seen the growth of small machine customers in the domestic market 
the market continues to experience a decline in large machine sales  continuing the change in the sales mix of embroidery machines and an overall decline in demand 
it was further compounded by weakening value in foreign exchange of the yen versus the us dollar  resulting in dollar price pressure for machine sales 
all japanese equipment based competitors in the industry faced difficulty in meeting these new market demands 
in fiscal the company initiated a restructuring program to address the market shifts in the industry  including closing and consolidating certain divisions  reducing total employment  and consolidating facilities that were no longer required to support its new business model see note of notes to consolidated financial statements

use of estimates and critical accounting policies the preparation of hirsch s financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the period 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty  therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates  and such differences may be material to our financial statements 
management continually evaluates its estimates and assumptions  which are based on historical experience and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates and hirsch s actual results are subject to the risk factors listed above under item business risk factors 
critical accounting policies management believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements revenue recognition the company distributes embroidery equipment that it offers for sale 
where installation and customer acceptance are a substantive part of the sale  by its terms  the company has deferred recognition of the revenue until such customer acceptance of installation has occurred 
in fiscal years  and  most sales of new equipment did not require installation within the terms of the sales contract and accordingly sales are booked when shipped 
service revenues and costs are recognized when services are provided 
sales of computer hardware and software are recognized when shipped provided that no significant vendor and post contract and support obligations remain and collection is probable 
sales of parts and supplies are recognized when shipped 
long lived assets the company reviews its long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment  identifiable intangibles goodwill and purchased technologies  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable 
to determine recoverability of its long lived assets  the company evaluates the probability that future undiscounted net cash flows will be less than the carrying amount of the assets 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal   of goodwill associated with the acquisitions of smx corporation  sedeco corporation and all pro punching  inc was written off

income taxes current income tax expense is the amount of income taxes expected to be payable for the current year 
a deferred income tax asset or liability is established for the expected future consequences resulting from temporary differences in the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
the company provides a valuation allowance for its deferred tax assets when  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
an estimate of uncollectable amounts is made by management based upon historical bad debts  current customer receivable balances  age of customer receivable balances  the customer s financial condition and current economic trends 
if the actual uncollected amounts significantly exceed the estimated allowance  then the company s operating results could be significantly adversely affected 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using the average cost for supplies and parts and specific cost for embroidery machines and peripherals 
the inventory balance is recorded net of an estimated allowance for obsolete or unmarketable inventory 
the estimated allowance for obsolete or unmarketable inventory is based upon management s understanding of market conditions and forecasts of future product demand 
if the actual amount of obsolete or unmarketable inventory significantly exceeds the estimated allowance  the company s cost of sales  gross profit and net income loss could be significantly adversely affected 
warranty the company instituted a five year limited warranty policy for its embroidery machines 
the company s policy is to accrue the estimated cost of satisfying future warranty claims on a quarterly basis 
in estimating its future warranty obligations  the company considers various relevant factors  including the company s stated warranty policies and practices  the historical frequency of claims  and the cost to replace or repair its products under warranty 
if the number of actual warranty claims or the cost of satisfying warranty claims significantly exceeds the estimated warranty reserve  the company s operating expenses and net income loss could be significantly adversely affected

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to various market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as foreign currency exchange and interest rates 
the company has a formal policy that prohibits the use of currency derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the policy permits the use of financial instruments to manage and reduce the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates that may arise in the normal course of the company s business 
currently  the company does not use interest rate derivatives 
the company may from time to time enter into forward foreign exchange contracts principally to hedge the currency fluctuations in transactions denominated in foreign currencies  thereby limiting the company s risk that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates 
any company debt  if utilized  is us dollar denominated and floating rate based 
at year end  there was no usage of the revolving credit facility 
if the company had utilized its credit facility  it would have exposure to rising and falling rates  and an increase in such rates would have an adverse impact on net pre tax expenses 
the company does not use interest rate derivatives to protect its exposure to interest rate market movements
