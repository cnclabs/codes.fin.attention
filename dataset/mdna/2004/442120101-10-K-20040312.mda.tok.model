table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our business and the results of operations together with our present financial conditions 
this section should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
statements in our discussion may be forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties 
we caution that a number of factors could cause future production  revenues and expenses to differ materially from our expectations 
see forward looking statements at the beginning of this annual report and risk factors affecting our business found on page for additional discussion of some of these factors and risks 
overview of our business we are an independent natural gas and oil company engaged in the exploration  development  exploitation and acquisition of natural gas and oil reserves in north america 
natural gas is our primary focus 
our core areas of operations are south texas  offshore in the shallow waters of the gulf of mexico  the arkoma basin of oklahoma and arkansas and the appalachian basin of west virginia 
during  we commenced operations in the rocky mountain region  with an initial focus in the uinta basin of northeastern utah 
we operate in one segment as each of our operating areas has similar economic characteristics and each meets the criteria for aggregation as defined in sfas source of our revenues we derive our revenues from the sale of natural gas and oil that is produced from our natural gas and oil properties 
revenues are a function of the volume produced and the prevailing market price at the time of sale 
the price of natural gas is the primary factor affecting our revenues 
to achieve more predictable cash flows and to reduce our exposure to downward price fluctuations  we utilize derivative instruments to hedge future sales prices on a significant portion of our natural gas production 
the use of certain types derivative instruments may prevent us from realizing the benefit of upward price movements 
at december   keyspan held of our common stock 
keyspan has indicated a desire to divest of its shares held in our company 
in february  keyspan divested three million shares of our common stock 
keyspan has publicly announced it does not consider its investment in houston exploration a part of its core asset group and that it may sell or dispose of all or a portion of its non core assets  including its investment in our company 
because market conditions are unpredictable  keyspan is unable to determine if or when any additional dispositions of all or a portion of its remaining ownership interest in our company will take place 
principal components of our cost structure lifting costs 
the day to day costs incurred to bring hydrocarbons out of the ground and to the market together with the daily costs incurred to maintain our producing properties 
these costs include lease operating expense  severance tax and transportation expense 
depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a 
the systematic expensing of the capital costs incurred to acquire  explore and develop natural gas and oil 
as a full cost company  we capitalize all direct costs associated with our acquisition  exploration and development efforts  including interest and certain general and administrative costs  and apportion these costs to each unit of production sold through dd a expense 
generally  if reserve quantities are revised up or down  the dd a rate per unit of production will change inversely 
when the depreciable base increases or decreases  the dd a rate will move in the same direction 
asset retirement accretion expense aro 
the systematic  monthly accretion of future abandonment costs of tangible assets such as platforms  wells  service assets  pipelines  and other facilities 
general and administrative g a 
overhead  including payroll and benefits for our corporate staff  costs of maintaining our headquarters  managing our production and development operations and legal compliance are included in our general and administrative expense g a 
we capitalize g a directly related to our acquisition  exploration and development activities 
interest 
we typically finance acquisitions with borrowings under our revolving bank credit facility  and longer term  with public traded debt instruments 
as a result  we incur substantial interest expense that correlates to both fluctuations in interest rates and our acquisition activity 
acquisitions are a critical element of our growth strategy 
we expect to continue to incur significant interest expense as we continue to grow 
we capitalize interest directly related to our unevaluated properties and certain properties under development  which are not being amortized 
income taxes 
we are generally subject to a federal income tax rate 
for income tax purposes  we are allowed deductions for accelerated depreciation  depletion and intangible drilling costs that reduce our current tax liability 
prior to  all of our taxes  both federal and state  were deferred  however  during  we utilized all of our net operating loss carryforwards and as a result  we recognized current income tax expense and will continue to recognized current tax expense as long as we are generating taxable income 
industry environment we currently operate exclusively in north america 
after over years of active natural gas and oil exploration and production within the lower states and gulf of mexico  the region has matured and production of natural gas and oil has declined 
numerous technological advances during this timeframe  including increasingly sophisticated geophysical tools that allow more accurate identification of reservoirs  horizontal and other drilling technologies that facilitate and enhance the extraction process  and advanced completion techniques have accelerated production rates and hastened depletion 
while new discoveries are still being made in north america  the frequency and size of these discoveries is declining 
as a result  
table of contents domestic natural gas and oil production as a whole may have peaked and is expected to decline in the future  with the exception of regions such as the rocky mountains  which we believe  continues to hold the prospect for production growth 
in this mature environment  companies will find it increasingly difficult to replace their reserves through traditional exploration and development efforts  and companies will increasingly be forced to rely on acquisitions to sustain their growth 
our future success growing our reserve base at an acceptable finding cost will depend in large part on our ability to acquire new proven reserves and unevaluated acreage on which we can explore for new discoveries 
we maintain a very active acquisition program and will continue to devote significant resources to identifying and pursuing both tactical acquisitions that augment our existing property base as well as substantial  strategic acquisitions 
we anticipate that the continued decline of the north american gas basin will lead to higher cost structures throughout our industry 
we believe that the cost of finding  developing and producing new natural gas and oil reserves will rise as the industry makes fewer discoveries of smaller reserve size 
for full cost companies such as ours  this will result in higher finding and development costs and higher dd a rates and ultimately the increased likelihood of a writedown in carrying value of our natural gas and oil properties 
in addition  we think lease operating expenses will continue to rise as producers are forced to make operational enhancements to maintain aging fields 
like any commodity  the price that we receive for the gas we produce is largely a function of supply and demand 
demand for natural gas is affected by general economic conditions  such as growth in the space heating  industrial and power generation segments  and seasonal conditions 
demand has also typically been impacted by seasonal fluctuations  with the peak demand during the winter heating season and summer air conditioning season 
as natural gas is difficult to import  to of the united states natural gas demand in recent years has been supplied by domestic production 
imports from canada have made up to of the united states natural gas needs and imports from a variety of other countries now make up for to of total supply in the form of liquefied natural gas  or lng 
situations involving over or under supply of natural gas can result in substantial price volatility 
for example  concerns over the adequacy of natural gas in storage during the first quarter of resulted in prices exceeding during the quarter and emerging concerns over the united states ability to meet its longer term gas needs from declining domestic supply have resulted in sustained prices above throughout and into as a direct result  we were able to increase our net income  generate substantial cash flows to fund acquisitions  our capital budget and repay borrowings on our revolving bank credit facility 
however  historically  commodity prices have been very volatile  and we expect the volatility to continue in the future 
as a result  we cannot accurately predict future natural gas and oil prices  and  therefore  we cannot determine what effect increases or decreases will have on our future revenues and cash flows 
a substantial or extended decline in natural gas and oil prices or poor drilling results could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations  cash flows  quantities of natural gas and oil reserves that may be economically produced and our ability to access capital markets 
our continued growth and profitability depends on the strength of comodity prices our ability to acquire  find and develop new reserves at economical costs 

table of contents critical accounting estimates proved reserves 
our most significant financial estimates are based on estimates of proved natural gas and oil reserves 
estimates of proved reserves are key components of our unevaluated properties  our rate for recording depreciation  depletion and amortization  and our full cost ceiling limitation 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting future revenues  rates of production and timing of development expenditures  including many factors beyond our control 
the estimation process relies on assumptions and interpretations of available geologic  geophysical  engineering and production data and the accuracy of reserve estimates is highly dependent on the quality and quantity of available data 
our reserves are fully engineered on an annual basis by independent petroleum engineers 
asset retirement obligation 
asset retirement obligations represent the estimated future abandonment costs of tangible long lived assets such as platforms  wells  service assets  pipelines  and other facilities 
we estimate the fair value of an asset s retirement obligation in the period in which the liability is incurred  if a reasonable estimate can be made 
we employ a present value technique to estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation  which reflects certain assumptions  including an inflation rate  the our credit adjusted risk free interest rate  the estimated settlement date of the liability and the estimated current cost to settle the liability which we compute from third party quotes 
changes in timing or to the original estimate of cash flows will result in changes to the carrying amount of the liability 
derivative instruments 
under sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  we reflect the fair market value of our derivative instruments on our balance sheet 
our estimates of fair value are determined by obtaining independent market quotes from third parties  as well as utilizing a black scholes option valuation model that is based upon underlying forward price curve data  a risk free interest rate and estimated volatility factors 
recent accounting developments sfas  business combinations and sfas  goodwill and intangible assets  became effective on july  and january   respectively 
these new standards emphasize a more precise evaluation of assets and their balance sheet classification as either tangible or intangible assets 
we understand that the issue is under evaluation as to whether provisions of sfas and sfas may call for mineral rights held under lease or other contractual arrangements together with cash costs for the acquisition of natural gas and oil leasehold interests to be classified in the balance sheet as intangible assets 
if these types of leasehold costs both proved and unevaluated are determined to be intangible assets  they would be classified separately from natural gas and oil properties as intangible assets on our balance sheets 
this issue relates only to balance sheet classification and presentation and we do not believe it will have an effect on cash flows or results of operations 
at december   if we applied the interpretation currently under discussion  undeveloped leasehold costs of million and developed leasehold costs of million  net of accumulated amortization  would be reclassified from tangibles to intangibles  representing costs incurred since june   the effective date of sfas at december   we had undeveloped leasehold costs of million and developed leasehold costs of million  net of accumulated amortization that would be reclassified from tangibles to intangibles 
consistent with current industry practice  we will continue to classify our natural gas and oil leasehold costs as tangible natural gas and oil properties until the emerging issues task force issues further guidance 
new accounting pronouncements in november  fasb issued financial interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin requires certain guarantees to be recorded at fair value  which is different from the previous practice of recording a liability only when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable  as those terms are defined in sfas  accounting for contingencies 
fin has a dual effective date 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the disclosure requirements in the interpretation are effective for financial statements for interim or annual periods ending after december  as of our december   and december   balance sheet dates  we did not have any guarantees of indebtedness of others and as a result  our adoption of fin did not have an effect on our financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued fin  consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of accounting research bulletin fin addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities vies and the primary objective is to provide guidance on the identification of  and financial reporting for  entities over which control is achieved through means other than voting rights  such entities are known as vies 
fin requires an entity to consolidate a vie if the entity has a variable interest or combination of variable interests that will absorb a majority of the entity s expected losses if they occur  receive a majority of the entity s expected residual returns if they occur or both 
this guidance applies immediately to vies created after january   and to vies in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date 
however  on october   the fasb decided to grant a broader deferral of the implementation of fin pursuant to this deferral  public companies must complete their evaluations of vies that existed prior to february   and the consolidation of those for which they are the primary beneficiary for financial statements issued for the first period ending after december  for calendar year companies  consolidation of previously existing vies will be required in their december   financial statements 
we have completed our evaluation of fin and because we do not believe that we have any vies there is no impact to our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents overview of results strong energy commodity prices were the primary force behind a record year for operations  earnings and cash flows 
the increase in our cash flows allowed for increased capital spending for drilling  acquisitions  and the repayment of debt  all of which improved our balance sheet 
during we generated  million in net income  an increase from  which was primarily attributable to a increase in average realized natural gas prices  we produced a total of bcfe  and increased our average daily production rate by to mmcfe  per day  and we closed out with a record production rate of mmcfe per day during december  we increased our total net proved reserves by to bcfe with a pre tax net present value  discounted at  of future net cash flows of billion  we replaced of our production by adding bcfe of net proved reserves through a combination of drilling and acquisitions  we drilled a record wells  onshore and offshore  of which were successful reflecting a success rate of  we participated in and brought on line our first deep shelf discovery at high island and had a success rate on deep shelf tests for the year  we completed our largest acquisition of producing properties to date in october  by purchasing bcfe of net proved reserves in the gulf of mexico from transworld exploration and production inc for a net million  we added to our west virginia production base in december by acquiring producing properties adjacent to our existing fields and acquired bcfe of net proved reserves for a net million 
in conjunction with this acquisition and in an effort to improve our onshore asset portfolio  we agreed to divest of our south louisiana properties  effective november   and sold bcfe of net proved reserves for a net million in february  we established a new operating area in the rocky mountain region by leasing more than  net undeveloped acres throughout southwestern montana  the green river basin of southwestern wyoming and in the uinta basin of northeastern utah and successfully drilled our first exploratory well in the uinta basin during december  with an estimated wells planned for  we recouped and recognized as other income million million net of tax of prior years severance tax expense pursuant to the high cost tight gas formation designation received during the second half of for a portion of our south texas production  we generated million in net cash flows from operating activities and invested a net million in natural gas and oil properties  which included million for producing property acquisitions  we added bcfe in total proved reserves through the drill bit  bcfe through acquisitions and incurred downward revisions of bcfe bringing our all in finding and development cost to per mcfe for and per mcfe for a five year average  we assisted keyspan in divesting three million shares of our common stock which reduced their ownership interest to  we took advantage of favorable long term interest rates by redeeming our million of senior subordinate notes due and issuing million of senior subordinated notes due  and  we announced our capital expenditure budget of million

mcfe is defined one million cubic feet equivalent of natural gas  determined using the ratio of six mcf of natural gas to one bbl of crude oil  condensate or natural gas liquids 
operating income higher natural gas prices were the primary factor contributing to our increase in net income and our increase in operating income in over adding to the effects of higher commodity prices was an increase of in production volume 
increased revenues were offset in part by a increase in operating costs due primarily to the continued expansion of our operations combined with an increase in costs to maintain our existing production base together with higher dd a rates for commodity prices our average wellhead price during  before the effects of our hedging program  was per mcfe up over this increase in natural gas prices during accounted for million  or approximately of our million increase  in revenues before the effects of our hedging program 
our increase in natural gas and oil revenues was substantially offset by a million loss from our hedging program  which lowered the price that we realized on our natural gas production by mcf during the period 
the largest portion of this loss resulted from fixed price swaps for natural gas that we entered into during the fourth quarter of in connection with our acquisition of producing properties in south texas 
as a result of these swaps  we effectively fixed the price that we received on approximately mmcf per day at  resulting in a loss of million  or of our total hedging loss for production volume the increase in production for the current year is a result of newly developed production combined with additions from acquisitions made in and onshore  our daily production rates increased from an average of mmcfe day during to mmcfe day during the increase in onshore production is primarily attributable to newly developed production in south texas and arkoma 
in south texas we drilled successful wells and increased our average daily production rate to mmcfe day during from mmcfe day in in arkoma  we more than doubled the number of wells drilled in by successfully drilling wells during the impact of the newly developed production was seen in the fourth quarter of as our average daily rate in arkoma increased to mmcfe day 
for  we expect our onshore daily production rate to grow by an estimated or to average between and mmcfe day 

table of contents offshore  our production decreased from an average of mmcfe day during to an average of mmcfe day during for the first nine months of  offshore production averaged mmcfe day as production declines due to maturing reservoirs from existing key fields  mustang island a  high island  west cameron and south marsh island  were greater than new production added from wells and facilities brought on line throughout specifically  we had disappointing results at south timbalier that was brought on line in early contributing to the year over year production decline was the effect of shifting approximately million of our offshore capital expenditure budget to our onshore region to fund the may acquisition of producing properties in south texas from burlington resources 
during the fourth quarter of  offshore production increased by approximately to an average rate of mmcfe day as we began to absorb the properties acquired from transworld in mid october and experienced production increases from newly developed fields  in particular  high island and high island for  we expect offshore production to increase by to approximately mmcfe day  which will include an estimated mmcfe per day from the transworld properties 
effects of hedging for  we realized an average natural gas price of per mcf  which was or per mcf lower than our average unhedged natural gas price or wellhead price of for the period 
included in natural gas revenues is a loss of million from natural gas hedging activities  which includes an unrealized loss of million representing the ineffective portion of our derivative instruments that are not eligible for deferral under sfas no 
the ineffectiveness was a result of changes during the period in the price differentials between the index price of the derivative contract  which uses a new york mercantile exchange nymex index  and the index price for the point of sale for the cash flow that is being hedged  the majority of which is the houston ship channel index 
for  we realized an average gas price of per mcf  which was of the average unhedged natural gas price of for the period 
this resulted in natural gas revenues that were million higher than the revenues we would have achieved if hedges had not been in place during the period 
for  our natural gas revenues included a realized gain of million from hedging activities 
for  we realized an average oil price of per bbl  which was or per bbl lower than the average unhedged price of per bbl for the period 
as a result of oil hedging activities  oil revenues for were million lower than the revenues we would have achieved if oil hedges had not been in place during the period 
we had no oil hedges in place during and realized an average oil price of per bbl 
operating expenses years ended december  operating expenses per mcfe variance change lease operating expense severance tax transportation expense asset retirement accretion expense depreciation  depletion and amortization general and administrative  net total operating expenses per unit of production lease operating expense 
the increase in lease operating expenses for is attributable to the continued expansion of our operations both onshore and offshore 
our overall operating expenses are increasing as we add new wells and production facilities and continue to maintain production from existing  maturing properties 
specific increases for were incurred for production enhancement and compression  insurance and contract services 
in addition  we incurred million in non recurring expenses associated with workovers 
the acquisition of the transworld properties in october caused our lease operating expense on a per unit basis to increase from an average of per mcfe for the first nine months of to per mcfe during the fourth quarter of the majority of the transworld fields were originally developed by major oil and gas producers and due to their age and complexity  lease operating expenses for these properties are expected to be significantly higher than that of our existing offshore fields 
our plan for is to reduce operating expenses per unit of production for these properties through integration and exploitation 
we estimate that our lease operating expenses will average per mcfe during the first quarter of severance tax 
severance tax is a function of volume and revenues generated from onshore production 
the increase in severance tax expense and severance tax per mcfe for is due to a increase in average wellhead prices for natural gas during combined with a increase in onshore production during 
table of contents depreciation  depletion and amortization 
the increase in our dd a expense for was primarily a result of a higher depletion rate combined with a increase in production volumes for our depletion rate increased as a result of downward reserve revisions related to reservior performance of approximately bcfe  the addition of more costs to our depreciation base with fewer additions for reserves as our average finding and development cost increased from per mcfe during to per mcfe during  and a increase in our estimated future development costs at year end  the majority of which was due to the proved undeveloped classification of of the reserves acquired from transworld 
for  based on our current reserve base  we expect our depreciation  depletion and amortization rate to average per mcfe 
general and administrative expenses  net of overhead reimbursements and capitalized general and administrative 
years ended december  general and administrative per mcfe variance change gross general and administrative expense operating overhead reimbursements capitalized general and administrative expense general and administrative expense  net the increase in aggregate general and administrative expense is due primarily to the expansion of our workforce that corresponds to the continued expansion of our operations 
as our workforce expands  we have experienced an increase in salaries and related employee benefit expenses that include increases in our incentive compensation expense together with expense for stock compensation as we adopted the fair value expense provisions for stock options under sfas no 
 as amended  in january our rent expense increased as we expanded our leased office space in downtown houston to accommodate our growing workforce and opened an office in denver to coordinate our expansion into the rocky mountains 
our legal  audit and accounting expenses increased as we implemented new corporate governance policies required by the sarbanes oxley act of and engaged an outside firm to perform ongoing internal auditing functions 
the higher rate per mcfe during reflects the increase in our aggregate general and administrative expenses combined with a proportional reduction in the amount of general and administrative expense capitalized during the mix of our capitalized expenses has changed as we incurred more costs during that were not directly related to our natural gas and oil exploration and development activities 
we expect that as our company continues to grow and expand  our general and administrative expenses will increase 
for  we estimate that net general and administrative expenses will average between and per mcfe 
other income and expense  interest and taxes other income and expense 
for  other income and expense includes two components debt extinguishment expenses totaling million million net of tax  and income of million million net of tax related to the recoupment of prior years severance tax expense 
in july  we applied for and received from the railroad commission of texas a high cost tight gas formation designation for a portion of our south texas production 
for qualifying wells  production is either exempt from tax or taxed at a reduced rate until certain capital costs are recovered 
in  we recognized as other income  million million net of tax related to the recoupment of prior years severance tax expense 
for future periods  we do not expect to recognize additional refunds in excess of million 
the debt extinguishment expenses were incurred in june pursuant to the call and early redemption of our million notes and the issuance of million of senior subordinated notes 
we paid a premium for early redemption of million and incurred a non cash charge of million to write off the balance of the unamortized costs associated with issuing the million senior subordinated notes

operating income significantly lower natural gas prices were the primary factor contributing to our decrease in net income and our decrease operating income in from operating expenses increased by due to a combination of the continued expansion of our operations  an increase in costs to maintain our existing production base and higher dd a rates 
offsetting the effects of lower natural gas prices and higher operating expenses was an increase of in production volume 
commodity prices our average wellhead price during was per mmcfe  before the effects of our hedging program  down over natural gas and oil revenues  before effects of hedging  decreased by million during the effect of the decrease in natural gas prices from levels accounted for million of the decrease which was offset in part by an increase of million attributable to the increase in production volume and million related to the increase in oil prices during for  our natural gas and oil revenues were increased by a million gain from our hedging program  which increased our average realized price for natural gas production by mcf during the period 
production volume during  our production increased 
the increase was primarily attributable to production added from properties acquired in south texas since december  together with newly developed production generated from our subsequent development and workover programs initiated on these acquired properties during during  we successfully drilled and completed a total of new wells  consisting of onshore wells and offshore wells 
of the wells drilled onshore  were drilled in south texas  of which were drilled on our newly acquired acreage with the balance being drilled in our charco field 
onshore  our daily production rates increased from an average of mmcfe day during to an average of mmcfe day during properties acquired from conoco inc on december  accounted for mmcfe day of the increase for and properties acquired from burlington resources on may  accounted for mmcfe day of the increase for production from our charco field in south texas averaged mmcfe day during the current year and remained unchanged from rates 
production from all other onshore areas arkoma  east texas  west virginia and south louisiana decreased mmcfe day or approximately from an average of mmcfe day during to mmcfe day during primarily a result of a decrease in production in south louisiana due principally to natural reservoir decline 
offshore  our production decreased from an average of mmcfe day during to an average of mmcfe day during during january  we initiated production from our newly completed facilities at vermilion we 
table of contents added new facilities and a series of new wells throughout at east cameron  and during september and october we evacuated and shut in offshore platforms and facilities due to tropical storms faye and isidore and hurricane lili 
we estimate that we shut in approximately mmcfe or mmcfe day on an annualized basis 
in october  we acquired from keyspan incremental working interests in offshore wells that were initially developed under a joint exploration agreement with keyspan see note related party transactions keyspan joint venture from through overall  for the year  increments in production growth resulting from our acquisition and our new exploration and development projects was offset by natural production declines in existing properties 
effects of hedging as a result of hedging activities  we realized an average gas price of per mcf for  which was per mcf or greater than the average unhedged natural gas price of that we otherwise would have received if hedges had not been in place during the year 
for  our hedging activities resulted in a gain of million that is included in natural gas and oil revenues 
for  we realized an average gas price of per mcf  which was per mcf or higher than the average unhedged natural gas price of

operating expenses years ended december  variance change operating expenses per mcfe lease operating expense severance tax transportation expense depreciation  depletion and amortization writedown in carrying value of properties general and administrative  net total operating expenses per unit of production lease operating expense 
the increase in both lease operating expenses and lease operating expenses per unit is attributable to the continued expansion of our operations combined with an increase in expenses incurred during onshore operations expanded with the acquisition of approximately new producing wells in south texas from the december  acquisition from conoco inc and the may  acquisition from burlington resources 
excluding the incremental expenses relating to newly acquired properties  the increase in our onshore lease operating expenses is due primarily to increased ad valorem taxes and increased compression expenses 
ad valorem taxes increased as a result of the high natural gas prices experienced in compression expenses increased during the second half of as we implemented a project in the charco field to boost production by adding compressors to streamline and lower gathering system pressure 
offshore  our lease operating expenses increased due to the addition of production facilities at vermilion and east cameron  new processing fees attributable to oil production at vermilion where we have chosen to have a third party process our oil rather than constructing our own oil facilities  the implementation of compression projects to enhance production capabilities at several of our existing facilities and finally  an increase in well control insurance premiums during the current year 
severance tax 
the decrease in severance tax expense is primarily due to million recorded during the fourth quarter of related to refunds of expense incurred during the current year 
in july  we applied for and received from the railroad commission of texas a high cost tight gas formation designation for a portion of our south texas production see note commitments and contingencies severance tax refund 
in addition to the million recorded as a reduction to current year severance tax expense  we recognized as other non operating income million for refunds relating to prior periods 
excluding the effect for the million  severance tax would have been million and per mcfe during compared to million and per mcfe for expense is comparable because wellhead prices were lower during as compared to wellhead prices received during  however  our onshore production increased by during which accounts for the decrease in the adjusted severance tax on a per unit basis 
depreciation  depletion and amortization 
the increase in depreciation  depletion and amortization expense was a result of higher production volumes combined with a higher depletion rate 
our depletion rate increased in as we completed the evaluation of several properties that were classified as unproved at december  as evaluation is completed  the costs associated with these properties were reclassified into our amortization base 
the higher depletion rate is a result of a combination of adding costs to the full cost pool with fewer new reserves being added from exploration and developmental drilling together with an overall increase in our finding and development costs

table of contents liquidity capital requirements our principal requirements for capital are to fund our capital investment program and to satisfy our contractual obligations  primarily the repayment of long term debt 
our capital investments include the following costs of acquiring and maintaining our lease acreage position and our seismic resources  costs of drilling and completing new natural gas and oil wells  costs of installing new production infrastructure  costs of maintaining  repairing  and enhancing existing natural gas and oil wells  costs related to plugging and abandoning unproductive or uneconomic wells  and indirect costs related to our exploration activities  including payroll and other expense attributable to our exploration professional staff 
our capital expenditure budget for has been set at an initial level of million 
we are the designated operator of approximately of our wells 
operating allows us the ability to exercise control over the magnitude and timing of our capital program and provides us significant latitude to increase or decrease our spending in response to changes in price  operational developments or acquisition opportunities 
to maintain flexibility of our capital program  we do not enter into material long term obligations with any of our drilling contractors or service providers with respect to our operated properties 
we do not include property acquisition costs in our capital budget because the size and timing of capital requirements for acquisitions are inherently unpredictable 
as the year progresses  we will continue to evaluate our capital spending 
actual levels may vary due to a variety of factors  including drilling results  natural gas prices  economic conditions and future acquisitions 
during  we invested million in natural gas and oil properties  which includes million for the acquisition of producing properties  and million for other property and equipment 
investments in non natural gas and oil properties includes the expansion of our houston office space together with upgrades to our information technology systems and equipment and compares to million spent in for  we spent offshore and onshore with the balance of on capitalized interest and general and administrative costs

table of contents future commitments in addition to our capital expenditure program  we are committed to making cash payments in the future on two types of contracts note agreements and operating leases 
we do not have off balance sheet debt or other such unrecorded obligations  and we have not guaranteed the debt of any other party 
the table below provides estimates of the timing of future payments that we were obligated to make based on agreements in place at december  in addition to the contractual obligations listed on the table below  our balance sheet at december   reflects accrued interest payable on our revolving bank credit facility of  which is payable over the next day period 
we expect to make annual interest payments of million per year on our million of senior subordinated notes due june and  we anticipate making income tax payments of approximately million to million in at december  payments due by period total year or less years years after years in thousands contractual obligations revolving bank credit facility  due july senior subordinated notes  due june operating leases other long term obligations asset retirement obligations total contractual obligations and commitments capital resources we intend to fund our capital expenditure program and contractual commitments through cash flows from our operations and borrowings under our revolving bank credit facility 
to the extent we make a significant acquisition  we may also access public markets for debt 
our primary sources of cash during were from funds generated from operations and net proceeds received from the concurrent early redemption of our million senior subordinated notes and the issuance of million senior subordinated notes in june 
cash was used to fund acquisitions  exploration and development expenditures and to reduce debt under our revolving bank credit facility 
we made aggregate cash payments of million and million  respectively  for interest and taxes 
the table below summarizes the sources of cash during and years ended december  variance change net income non cash charges cash from operations before changes in operating assets and liabilities change increase in operating assets and liabilities net cash provided by operating activities net cash used for investments in property and equipment net cash provided by financing activities net decrease increase in cash at december   we had a working capital deficit of  long term debt of million and million of borrowing capacity available under our revolving bank credit facility 
the working capital deficit was due to a current liability of million representing the fair value of our derivative instruments 
the fair value of our derivative instruments will fluctuate with commodity prices  and as commodity prices increase  our liquidity exposure tends to increase as a result of open derivative instruments 
consequently  we are more likely to have the largest unfavorable mark 
table of contents to market position in a high commodity price environment 
our working capital balance fluctuates as a result of the timing and amount of cash receipts and disbursements for operating activities and borrowings or repayments under our revolving bank credit facility 
as a result  we often have a working capital deficit or a relatively small amount of positive working capital 
the increase in net cash provided by operating activities during was primarily attributable to the increase in net income as a result of a increase in average realized natural gas price  which includes the effects of hedging  together with a increase in production volume  offset in part by a increase in operating expenses 
the increase in non cash charges for was primarily a result of the increase in depreciation  depletion and amortization and deferred tax expense combined with current year charges for debt extinguishment  ineffectiveness of our derivative instruments and the cumulative effect of adopting sfas for asset retirement obligations 
the increase in cash from operations was reduced in part by a net increase in operating assets and liabilities 
fluctuations in operating assets and liabilities are caused by the timing of cash receipts and disbursements 
during  we took advantage of lower long term interest rates to increase our available borrowing capacity under our revolving bank credit facility 
in june  we called and redeemed our million notes due and issued million senior subordinated notes 
the net proceeds from the million notes were used to repay the outstanding principal and interest on the million notes together with a premium of million for early redemption 
we used the remaining net proceeds to repay outstanding borrowings under our revolving bank credit facility and by the end of the third quarter of  we had reduced our bank borrowings from million at december  to zero at september  in the fourth quarter of  we increased our bank borrowings to million of which million was used in october to finance a portion of the transworld net purchase price of million with the balance borrowed in december to fund a portion of the million net purchase price for the enervest properties 
for  total long term debt increased by a net million as we increased fixed debt by million and reduced our bank debt by million compared to an increase of million in total long term borrowings during we received cash proceeds of million for the issuance of common stock from the exercise of stock options compared to million received in and  during the first quarter of  we sold million newly issued shares of our common stock in a public offering for net proceeds of million  and simultaneously repurchased the same number of shares from keyspan for million 
revolving bank credit facility 
we maintain a revolving bank credit facility with a syndicate of lenders led by wachovia bank  national association  as issuing bank and administrative agent  the bank of nova scotia and fleet national bank as co syndication agents and bnp paribas as documentation agent 
the credit facility provides us with a commitment of million which may be increased at our request and with prior approval from wachovia to a maximum of million by adding one or more lenders or by allowing one or more lenders to increase their commitments 
the credit facility is subject to borrowing base limitations 
our current borrowing base is million and is redetermined semi annually  with the next redetermination scheduled for april  up to million of the borrowing base is available for the issuance of letters of credit 
the credit facility matures july   is unsecured and with the exception of trade payables  ranks senior to our senior subordinated notes 
at december   we were in compliance with all covenants 
see note long term debt and notes for a summary of material covenants 
at december   we had borrowings under our revolving bank credit facility of million and million in outstanding letter of credit obligations 
subsequent to december   we repaid a net million in outstanding borrowing under the facility  the primary source of these funds was proceeds received from the sale of our south louisiana properties in early february at march   the date of this report  outstanding borrowings and letter of credit obligations under our revolving bank credit facility total million 
in an effort to increase our borrowing capacity for property acquisitions  we are in the process of amending our current revolving bank credit facility to increase the borrowing capacity from million to million 
the lenders and the primary terms and conditions of the new facility are expected to be consistent with the existing facility 
the commitment is expected to increase to million with the capability to increase the commitment to million and we expect to have million of the borrowing base available for letters of credit 
the new facility is expected to become effective on april  our initial borrowing base is expected to be million and is scheduled for redetermination october  outstanding borrowings are expected to continue to be unsecured and with the exception of trade payables  the new facility is expected to rank senior to our million subordinated notes 
the new facility is expected to mature on april  senior subordinated notes 
on june   we issued million senior subordinated notes due june  the notes bear interest at a rate of per annum with interest payable semi annually on june and december  beginning december  we may redeem the notes at our option  in whole or in part  at any time on or after june  at a price equal to of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any  plus a specified premium which decreases yearly from in to in and thereafter 
in addition  at any time prior to june   we may redeem up to a maximum of of the aggregate principal amount with the net proceeds of one or more equity 
table of contents offerings at a price equal to of the principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest and liquidated damages  if any 
the notes are general unsecured obligations and rank subordinate in right of payment to all existing and future senior debt  including the revolving bank credit facility  and will rank senior or equal in right of payment to all existing and future subordinated indebtedness 
the million senior subordinated notes were issued in conjunction with the call and early redemption of our million senior subordinated notes due january  the redemption and payment of the call premium on the million notes was funded with a portion of the proceeds received from the issuance of the million senior subordinated notes 
pursuant to the early redemption of the million notes  we incurred debt extinguishment expenses totaling million million net of tax consisting of the call premium of million together with a non cash charge of million for the write off of the balance of the unamortized issue costs of the notes 
the debt extinguishment expenses of million are included in the line item other income expense on the statement of operations for the year ended december  access to capital markets 
we currently have on file with the sec a shelf registration statement covering the sale  from time to time  of our common stock  preferred stock  depositary shares and debt securities  or a combination of any of these securities 
the shelf was filed in may and provided for an initial aggregate public offering price of up to million 
in february  we sold  shares of our common stock to the public under the shelf registration statement and used the proceeds to concurrently repurchase three million shares of our common stock from keyspan 
following that offering  we had approximately million of capacity remaining under the shelf 
in march  we plan to terminate our existing shelf registration statement and replace it with a new shelf registration statement to be filed with the sec covering the offering  from time to time  of up to million of our common stock  preferred stock  depositary shares and debt securities  or a combination of any of these securities 
we believe that operating cash flow and our credit facility will be adequate to meet our capital and operating requirements for we continuously monitor our working capital and debt position as well as coordinate our capital expenditure program with expected cash flows and projected debt repayment schedules 
although we have no specific budget for property acquisitions  should attractive opportunities arise  we believe we could finance the additional capital expenditures with cash on hand  operating cash flow  additional borrowing under our revolving bank credit facility  issuances of additional equity or debt securities or development with industry partners 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk natural gas and oil hedging we utilize derivative commodity instruments to hedge future sales prices on a portion of our natural gas and oil production to achieve a more predictable cash flow  as well as to reduce our exposure to adverse price fluctuations of natural gas 
our derivatives are not held for trading purposes 
while the use of hedging arrangements limits the downside risk of adverse price movements  it also limits increases in future revenues as a result of favorable price movements 
the use of hedging transactions also involves the risk that the counterparties are unable to meet the financial terms of such transactions 
hedging instruments that we use are swaps  collars and options  which we generally place with major investment grade financial institutions that we believe are minimal credit risks 
we believe that our credit risk related to our natural gas futures and swap contracts is no greater than the risk associated with the primary contracts and that the elimination of price risk reduces volatility in our reported results of operations  financial position and cash flows from period to period and lowers our overall business risk  however  as a result of our hedging activities we may be exposed to greater credit risk in the future 
our hedges are cash flow hedges and qualify for hedge accounting under sfas no 
and  accordingly  we carry the fair market value of our derivative instruments on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability and defer unrealized gains or losses in accumulated other comprehensive income 
gains and losses are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to the income statement as a component of natural gas and oil revenues in the period the hedged production occurs 
if any ineffectiveness occurs  amounts are recorded directly to other income or expense 
in  we recognized million of ineffectiveness 
the ineffectiveness was a result of changes during the period in the price differentials between the index price of the derivative contract  which uses a nymex index  and the index price for the point of sale for the cash flow that is being hedged  the majority of which is the houston ship channel index 
ineffectiveness was not material prior to changes in fair value of derivative instruments the following table summarizes the change in the fair value of our derivative instruments for each of the twelve month periods from january to december  and and provides the fair value at the end of each period

for the three months january through march  our floor price will average mmbtu on  mmbtu day and our ceiling price will average mmbtu on  mmbtu day  with no ceiling price on the remaining  mmbtu day 
for the remaining nine months of  our floor price will average mmbtu on  mmbtu day and our ceiling price will average mmbtu on  mmbtu day

in order to determine fair market value of our derivative instruments  we obtain mark to market quotes from external counterparties 
with respect to any particular swap transaction  the counterparty is required to make a payment to us if the settlement price for any settlement period is less than the swap price for the transaction  and we are required to make payment to the counterparty if the settlement price for any settlement period is greater than the swap price for the transaction 
for any particular collar transaction  the counterparty is required to make a payment to us if the settlement price for any settlement period is below the floor price for the transaction  and we are required to make payment to the counterparty if the settlement price for any settlement period is above the ceiling price for the transaction 
we are not required to make or receive any payment in connection with a collar transaction if the settlement price is between the floor and the ceiling
