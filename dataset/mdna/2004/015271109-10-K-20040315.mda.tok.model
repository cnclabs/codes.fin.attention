item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the terms we  our  ours and us as used in this form k refer to alexandria real estate equities  inc and its subsidiaries 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this form k 
overview we are a publicly traded real estate operating company focused principally on the ownership  operation  management  acquisition  expansion and selective redevelopment and development of high quality  strategically located properties containing a combination of office and laboratory space leased principally to tenants in the life science industry 
we refer to these properties as life science facilities 
in  we acquired four properties with an aggregate of approximately  rentable square feet 
expanded our unsecured line of credit from million to million and extended its term to november  which may be further extended at our sole option for an additional one year period 
obtained an unsecured term loan for million that is due november sold three properties with an aggregate of approximately  rentable square feet 
our primary source of revenue is rental income and tenant recoveries from leases at the properties we own 
of the properties we owned as of december   four were acquired in  nine in  nine in  in  six in  in  five in  four in and four in in addition  we completed the development of one property in  five properties in together with the properties acquired in  the properties  two properties in together with the five properties acquired in  the properties and two properties in together with the four properties acquired in  the properties 
as a result of these acquisition and development activities  as well as our ongoing leasing and redevelopment activities  there have been significant increases in total revenues and expenses  including significant increases in total revenues and expenses for as compared to  and for as compared to critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of these financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
we base these estimates  judgments and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
reit compliance we have elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust reit under the internal revenue code 
qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the internal revenue code to our operations and financial results and the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control 
we believe that our current organization and method of operation comply with the rules and regulations promulgated under the internal revenue code to enable us to qualify  and continue to qualify  as a reit 
however  it is possible that we have been organized or have operated in a manner that would not allow us to qualify as a reit  or that our future operations could cause us to fail to qualify 
if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  then we will be required to pay federal income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates 
if we lose our reit status  then our net earnings available for investment or distribution to stockholders would be significantly reduced for each of the years involved and we would no longer be required to make distributions to our stockholders 
rental properties and properties under development in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations sfas  we perform the following procedures when making an allocation of the purchase price of real estate estimate the value of the real estate as of the acquisition date on an as if vacant basis  allocate the as if vacant value among land  land improvements  buildings  building improvements  tenant improvements and equipment  calculate the value of the intangibles as the difference between the as if vacant value and the purchase price  and allocate the intangible value to above  below and at market leases  origination costs associated with in place leases  tenant relationships and other intangible assets 
the values allocated to land improvements  buildings  building improvements  tenant improvements and equipment are depreciated on a straight line basis using an estimated life of years for land improvements  years for buildings and building improvements  the respective lease term for tenant improvements and the estimated useful life of equipment 
the values of above and below market leases are amortized over the life of the related lease and recorded as either an increase for below market leases or a decrease for above market leases to rental income 
the values of at market leases and origination costs are classified as leasing costs  included in other assets on our balance sheets and amortized over the remaining life of the lease 
the values of other intangible assets are amortized over the estimated useful life 
rental properties and properties under development are individually evaluated for impairment when conditions exist which may indicate that it is probable that the sum of expected future undiscounted cash flows is less than its carrying amount 
upon determination that an impairment has occurred  a write down is recorded to reduce the carrying amount of the property to its estimated fair value 
capitalization of costs we capitalize direct construction and development costs  including predevelopment costs  interest  property taxes  insurance and indirect project costs  including payroll and other costs directly associated with the acquisition  development or construction of a project 
payroll costs not related to the construction  development or redevelopment of a project  or acquisition of a property that will be classified as operating at the date of acquisition  are expensed as incurred 
costs incurred after a project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use are expensed as incurred 
costs previously capitalized related to abandoned acquisition or development opportunities are written off 
should development activity cease  a portion of interest  property taxes  insurance and certain costs would no longer be eligible for capitalization  and would be expensed as incurred 
we also capitalize costs directly related and essential to our leasing activities  including broker fees and certain costs related to our leasing personnel 
these costs are amortized on a straight line basis over the terms of the related leases 
costs previously capitalized related to unsuccessful leasing opportunities are written off 
accounting of investments we hold equity investments in certain publicly traded companies and privately held entities primarily involved in the life science industry 
all of our investments in publicly traded companies are considered available for sale under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities sfas  and are recorded at fair value 
fair value has been determined by the closing trading price at the balance sheet date  with unrealized gains and losses shown as a separate component of stockholders equity 
the classification of investments under sfas is determined at the time each investment is made  and such determination is reevaluated at each balance sheet date 
the cost of investments sold is determined by the specific identification method  with realized gains and losses included in other income 
investments in privately held entities are generally accounted for under the cost method because we do not influence any operating or financial policies of the entities in which we invest 
certain investments are accounted for under the equity method of accounting under the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock apb and emerging issues task force eitf topic d  accounting for limited partnership investments 
pursuant to apb  the equity method of accounting should be used when an investor has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies of an investee even though the investor holds or less of the voting stock 
eitf d further clarifies the securities and exchange commission s position on the accounting for limited partnerships and provides that the equity method of accounting be used unless the investor s interest is so minor that the limited partner may have virtually no influence over partnership operating and financial policies 
under the equity method of accounting  we record our investment initially at cost and adjust the carrying amount of the investment to recognize our share of the earnings or losses of the investee subsequent to the date of our investment 
for all of our investments  if a decline in the fair value of an investment below its carrying value is determined to be other than temporary  such investment is written down to its estimated fair value with a non cash charge to current earnings 
the factors that we consider in making these assessments include  but are not limited to  market prices  market conditions  prospects for favorable or unfavorable clinical trial results  new product initiatives and new collaborative agreements 
interest rate swap agreements we utilize interest rate swap agreements to hedge a portion of our exposure to variable interest rates associated with our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan 
these agreements involve an exchange of fixed and floating interest payments without the exchange of the underlying principal amount 
interest received under all of our swap agreements is based on the one month libor rate 
the net difference between the interest paid and the interest received is reflected as an adjustment to interest expense 
we reflect our interest rate swap agreements on the balance sheet at their estimated fair values 
we use a variety of methods and assumptions based on market conditions and risks existing at each balance sheet date to determine the fair values of our interest rate swap agreements 
these methods of assessing fair value result in a general approximation of value  and such value may never be realized 
all of our interest rate swap agreements meet the criteria to be deemed highly effective under statement of financial accounting standards no 
in reducing our exposure to variable interest rates 
accordingly  we have categorized these instruments as cash flow hedges 
while we intend to continue to meet the conditions for such hedge accounting  if hedges did not qualify as highly effective  the changes in the fair value of the derivatives used as hedges would be reflected in earnings 
we do not believe we are exposed to more than a nominal amount of credit risk in our interest rate swap agreements as our counterparties are established  well capitalized financial institutions 
recognition of rental income rental income from leases with scheduled rent increases  free rent and other rent adjustments are recognized on a straight line basis over the respective lease terms 
we maintain an allowance for estimated losses that may result from the inability of our tenants to make required payments 
if a tenant fails to make contractual payments beyond any allowance  we may recognize additional bad debt expense in future periods equal to the amount of unpaid rent and deferred rent 
discontinued operations the determination of whether a property qualifies as an asset held for sale and should be classified as discontinued operations requires an evaluation of certain criteria  some of which require the use of judgment 
a property is classified as held for sale when all of the following criteria for a plan of sale have been met management  having the authority to approve the action  commits to a plan to sell the property  the property is available for immediate sale in its present condition  subject only to the terms that are usual and customary  an active program to locate a buyer  and other actions required to complete the plan to sell  have been initiated  the sale of the property is probable and is expected to be completed within one year  the property is being actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value  and actions necessary to complete the plan of sale indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn 
when all of these criteria have been met  the property is classified as held for sale and its operations are classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of income 
when a property is designated as held for sale  amounts for all prior periods presented are reclassified from continuing operations to discontinued operations 
a loss is recognized for any initial adjustment of the asset s carrying amount to fair value less costs to sell in the period the asset qualifies as held for sale 
depreciation of assets is discontinued commencing on the date they are designated as held for sale 
results of operations comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december rental revenue increased by million  or  to million for compared to million for the increase resulted primarily from the properties being owned for a full year and the addition of the properties 
rental revenue from properties operating for a full year during and the same properties increased by million  or  due to increases in rental rates and offset by a slight decrease in occupancy 
the average occupancy level of the same properties was as of december   compared to as of december  tenant recoveries increased by million  or  to million for compared to million for the increase resulted primarily from the properties being owned for a full year and the addition of the properties 
tenant recoveries for the same properties increased by  or  primarily due to increases in certain recoverable operating expenses 
other income increased by  or  to million for compared to million for  primarily due to an increase in realized gains on investments and from a general increase in miscellaneous sources of income 
rental operating expenses increased by million  or  to million for compared to million for the increase resulted primarily from the properties being owned for a full year and the addition of the properties 
operating expenses for the same properties increased by  or  primarily due to an increase in property insurance and property taxes substantially all of which are recoverable from our tenants through tenant recoveries 
general and administrative expenses increased by  or  to million for compared to million for  mainly due to general increases in administrative costs  primarily payroll and related expenses 
interest expense increased by million  or  to million for compared to million for the increase resulted primarily from an increase in indebtedness on our unsecured line of credit  unsecured term loan and secured notes payable 
these borrowings were utilized to finance the acquisition of the and properties and the development and redevelopment of properties 
the increase in interest expense was partially offset by a decrease in the floating interest rate on our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan 
the weighted average effective interest rate on our borrowings not including the effect of swap agreements decreased from as of december  to as of december  we have entered into certain swap agreements to hedge a portion of exposure to variable interest rates with our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan see liquidity and capital resources unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan 
depreciation and amortization increased by million  or  to million for compared to million for the increase resulted primarily from depreciation associated with the properties being owned for a full year and the addition of the properties 
income from discontinued operations of million for reflects the results of operations of one property that was designated as held for sale as of december  and three properties that were sold during in the fourth quarter of  we sold one property in the suburban washington dc market 
in the third quarter of  we sold one property in the eastern massachusetts market 
in the first quarter of  we sold one property in the san francisco bay market 
in connection with these sales  we recorded a net gain of approximately million during comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december rental revenue increased by million  or  to million for compared to million for the increase resulted primarily from the properties being owned for a full year and the addition of the properties 
rental revenue from properties operating for a full year during and the same properties increased by million  or  due to increases in rental rates and offset by a slight decrease in occupancy 
the average occupancy level of the same properties was as of december   compared to as of december  tenant recoveries increased by million  or  to million for compared to million for the increase resulted primarily from the properties being owned for a full year and the addition of the properties 
tenant recoveries for the same properties increased by  or  generally due to an increase in certain recoverable operating expenses 
other income decreased by million  or  to million for compared to million for  primarily due to a decrease in interest income resulting from a decline in interest rates  the repayment of a million secured note receivable in and a decrease in realized gains on investments 
rental operating expenses increased by million  or  to million for compared to million for the increase resulted primarily from the properties being owned for a full year and the addition of the properties 
operating expenses for the same properties increased by million  or  primarily due to an increase in property insurance and property taxes substantially all of which are recoverable from our tenants through tenant recoveries 
general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million for compared to million for due to the continued increase in the scope of our operations 
from january  to december   we expanded our scope of operations to include an additional properties containing approximately  rentable square feet for a total of properties located in nine states with approximately million rentable square feet as of december  to assist in managing this increase in the size of the operating portfolio  we added personnel and offices in certain of the markets where we have properties 
interest expense decreased by million  or  to million for compared to million for the decrease resulted primarily from a reduction in the floating interest rate on our unsecured line of credit 
the weighted average interest rate on our borrowings not including the effect of swap agreements decreased from as of december  to as of december  we have entered into certain swap agreements to hedge a portion of our borrowings at variable interest rates see liquidity and capital resources unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan 
the decrease in interest expense caused by this factor was partially offset by an increase in indebtedness incurred to acquire the and properties and indebtedness incurred to finance the development and redevelopment of properties 
depreciation and amortization increased by million  or  to million for compared to million for the increase resulted primarily from depreciation associated with the properties being owned for a full year and the addition of the properties 
during  we recognized a non cash impairment charge of million associated with a decline in the value of certain investments below their carrying value determined to be other than temporary 
loss on early extinguishment of debt of million was incurred as the result of the early retirement of a million secured loan in connection with a refinancing of an asset 
this loss is related to prepayment penalties and the write off of loan costs 
in  this loss was classified as an extraordinary item as previously required under sfas  reporting gains and losses from extinguishment of debt 
in  pursuant to sfas  rescission of fasb statement no 
 and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections  we reclassified the loss on early extinguishment of debt to continuing operations 
income from discontinued operations decreased by  or  to million for compared to million for income from discontinued operations reflects the results of operations of four properties that have been designated as held for sale 
in connection with these prospective sales  we recorded a non cash impairment charge of  related to a property in the san francisco bay market which cannot be redeveloped pursuant to its original strategic objectives 
this charge has been included in income from discontinued operations for liquidity and capital resources cash flows net cash provided by operating activities for increased by million to million compared to million for the increase resulted primarily from increases in cash flows from our portfolio of operating properties  partially offset by the net gain on sales of property 
net cash used in investing activities decreased by million to million for compared to million for this decrease was primarily due to proceeds from the sales of rental properties and a lower level of property acquisitions in net cash provided by financing activities decreased by million to million for compared to million for cash provided by financing activities decreased primarily due to the net proceeds from our common stock and preferred stock offerings in  partially offset by net proceeds from our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan and from secured notes payable

unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan we have an unsecured line of credit that provides for borrowings of up to million 
borrowings under our unsecured line of credit  as amended  bear interest at a floating rate based on our election of either a libor based rate or the higher of the bank s reference rate and the federal funds rate  plus 
for each libor based advance  we must elect a libor period of one  two  three or six months 
our unsecured line of credit contains financial covenants  including  among other things  maintenance of minimum net worth  a total liabilities to gross asset value ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio 
in addition  the terms of the unsecured line of credit restrict  among other things  certain investments  indebtedness  distributions and mergers 
the unsecured line of credit expires november and may be extended at our sole option for an additional one year period

for each libor based advance  we must elect to fix for a period of one  two  three or six months 
the unsecured term loan contains financial covenants substantially similar to those in our unsecured line of credit 
the unsecured term loan expires in november as of december   the unsecured term loan carried a weighted average interest rate of 
aggregate borrowings under the unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan may be limited to an amount based on the net operating income derived from a pool of unencumbered properties 
accordingly  as we acquire or complete the development or redevelopment of additional unencumbered properties  aggregate borrowings available under the unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan will increase up to a maximum of million 
under these provisions  as of december   aggregate borrowings under our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan were limited to million 
we utilize interest rate swap agreements to hedge a portion of our exposure to variable interest rates associated with our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan 
these agreements involve an exchange of fixed and floating interest payments without the exchange of the underlying principal amount the notional amount 
interest received under all of our swap agreements is based on the one month libor rate

in addition  we have entered into master derivative agreements with each counterparty 
these master derivative agreements all of which are on the standard international swaps derivatives association  inc form define certain terms between us and each counterparty to address and minimize certain risks associated with our swap agreements  including a default by a counterparty 
as of december  and  our interest rate swap agreements have been reported in the accompanying balance sheets at their fair value as other liabilities of approximately million and million  respectively 
the offsetting adjustments were reflected as deferred losses in accumulated other comprehensive income of million and million  respectively 
balances in accumulated other comprehensive income are recognized in earnings as swap payments are made 
other resources and liquidity requirements in january  we completed a public offering of  shares of our series b cumulative redeemable preferred stock 
the shares were issued at a price of per share  resulting in aggregate proceeds of approximately million  net of offering costs 
in february  we sold  shares of our common stock 
the shares were issued at a price of per share  resulting in aggregate proceeds of approximately million  net of offering costs 
in july  we sold  shares of our common stock 
the shares were issued at a price of per share  resulting in aggregate proceeds of approximately million  net of offering costs 
we expect to continue meeting our short term liquidity and capital requirements generally through our working capital and net cash provided by operating activities 
we believe that the net cash provided by operating activities will continue to be sufficient to enable us to make distributions necessary to continue qualifying as a reit 
we also believe that net cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to fund our recurring non revenue enhancing capital expenditures  tenant improvements and leasing commissions 
we expect to meet certain long term liquidity requirements  such as property acquisitions  property development and redevelopment activities  scheduled debt maturities  expansions and other non recurring capital improvements  through excess net cash provided by operating activities  long term secured and unsecured borrowings  including borrowings under the unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan and the issuance of additional debt and or equity securities 
exposure to environmental liabilities in connection with the acquisition of all of our properties  we have obtained phase i environmental assessments to ascertain the existence of any environmental liabilities or other issues 
the phase i environmental assessments of our properties have not revealed any environmental liabilities that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole  nor are we aware of any material environmental liabilities that have occurred since the phase i environmental assessments were completed 
in addition  we carry a policy of pollution legal liability insurance covering exposure to certain environmental losses at all of our properties

major capital expenditures also include one time costs related to the implementation of our national branding and signage program in  and major capital expenditures for include  per square foot in portfolio in one time costs related to the implementation of our national branding and signage program 
recurring capital expenditures for include  per square foot in portfolio related to a fully leased property in san diego  california that underwent substantial renovation in excludes space that has undergone redevelopment before retenanting 
capital expenditures fluctuate in any given period due to the nature  extent and timing of improvements required and the extent to which they are recoverable from our tenants 
approximately of our leases provide for the recapture of certain capital expenditures such as hvac systems maintenance and or replacement  roof replacement and parking lot resurfacing 
in addition  we maintain an active preventative maintenance program at each of our properties to minimize capital expenditures required 
tenant improvements and leasing costs also fluctuate in any given year depending upon factors such as the timing and extent of vacancies  property age  location and characteristics  the type of lease renewal tenant or retenanted space  the involvement of external leasing agents and overall competitive market conditions 
inflation as of december   approximately of our leases on a square footage basis were triple net leases  requiring tenants to pay substantially all real estate taxes and insurance  common area and other operating expenses including increases thereto 
in addition  approximately of our leases on a square footage basis require the tenants to pay a majority of operating expenses 
approximately of our leases on a square footage basis contain effective annual rent escalations that are either fixed generally ranging from to or indexed based on the consumer price index or another index 
accordingly  we do not believe that our earnings or cash flow from real estate operations are subject to any significant risk of inflation 
an increase in inflation  however  could result in an increase in the cost of our variable rate borrowings  including our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan 
funds from operations gaap basis accounting for real estate assets utilizes historical cost accounting and assumes real estate values diminish over time 
in an effort to overcome the miscorrelation between real estate values and historical cost accounting for real estate assets  the board of governors of the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit established the measurement tool of funds from operations ffo 
since its introduction  ffo has become a widely used non gaap financial measure by reits 
we believe that ffo is helpful to investors as an additional measure of the performance of an equity reit 
we compute ffo in accordance with standards established by the board of governors of nareit in its april white paper the white paper and related implementation guidance  which may differ from the methodology for calculating ffo utilized by other equity reits  and  accordingly  may not be comparable to such other reits 
in  nareit issued guidance which modifies the calculation of ffo for both past and future periods 
in accordance with nareit s revised guidance  we now include losses from early extinguishment of debt and real estate impairment charges in our calculation of ffo 
as such  the reported amounts of ffo for the year ended december  have been modified from those previously reported 
the white paper defines ffo as net income loss computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales  plus real estate depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
while ffo is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance for reits  it should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap as an indication of financial performance  or to cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of our liquidity  nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs  including our ability to make distributions 
see cash flows for information regarding these measures of cash flow 
we believe that net income is the most directly comparable gaap financial measure to ffo 
the following table presents our ffo for the years ended december in thousands year ended december  net income    add depreciation and amortization    impairment on investments  less dividends on preferred stock    net gain on sales of property  funds from operations    includes depreciation and amortization on assets held for sale reflected as discontinued operations for the periods prior to when such assets were designated as held for sale 
net gain on sales of property relates to the disposition of a property in the suburban washington dc market during the quarter ended december   the disposition of a property in the eastern massachusetts market during the quarter ended september  and the disposition of a property in the san francisco bay market during the quarter ended march  net gain on sales of property is included on the income statement in income from discontinued operations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
the primary market risk to which we believe we are exposed is interest rate risk  which may result from many factors  including governmental monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors that are beyond our control 
in order to modify and manage the interest rate characteristics of our outstanding debt and to limit the effects of interest rate risks on our operations  we may utilize a variety of financial instruments  including interest rate swaps  caps  floors and other interest rate exchange contracts 
the use of these types of instruments to hedge our exposure to changes in interest rates carries additional risks  such as counter party credit risk and the legal enforceability of hedging contracts 
our future earnings  cash flows and fair values relating to financial instruments are primarily dependent upon prevalent market rates of interest  such as libor 
however  our interest rate swap agreements are intended to reduce the effects of interest rate changes 
based on interest rates at  and our swap agreements in effect on  december   we estimate that a increase in interest rates on our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan  after considering the effect of our interest rate swap agreements  would decrease annual future earnings and cash flows by approximately million 
we further estimate that a decrease in interest rates on our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan  after considering the effect of our interest rate swap agreements in effect december   would increase annual future earnings and cash flows by approximately million 
a increase in interest rates on our secured debt and interest rate swap agreements would decrease their aggregate fair value by approximately million 
a decrease in interest rates on our secured debt and interest rate swap agreements would increase their aggregate fair value by approximately million 
these amounts are determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on our borrowing cost and our interest rate swap agreements in effect on december  these analyses do not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
further  in the event of a change of such magnitude  we would consider taking actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  the sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in our capital structure 
we have exposure to equity price market risk because of our equity investments in certain publicly traded companies and privately held entities 
we classify investments in publicly traded companies as available for sale and  consequently  record them on our balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a component of comprehensive income or loss 
investments in privately held entities are generally accounted for under the cost method because we do not influence any of the operating or financial policies of the entities in which we invest 
for all investments  we recognize other than temporary declines in value against earnings in the same period the decline in value was deemed to have occurred 
in  we recorded non cash impairment charges of  to write down certain investments for which we deemed the decline in fair value to be other than temporary 
there is no assurance that future declines in values will not have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations 
by way of example  a decrease in the fair value of our equity investments as of december  would decrease their fair value by approximately million
