item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes contained elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion may contain forward looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results and the timing of selected events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of selected factors  including those set forth under risks related to our business in item all forward looking statements included here are based on information available to us as of the date hereof  and we assume no obligation to update any such forward looking statements 
overview urologix  inc  based in minneapolis  develops  manufactures and markets minimally invasive medical products for the treatment of urological disorders 
we have developed and offer non surgical  catheter based therapies that use a proprietary cooled microwave technology for the treatment of bph  a disease that dramatically affects more than million men worldwide by causing adverse changes in urinary voiding patterns 
we market our products under the targis and prostatron names 
both systems utilize cooled thermotherapy  a targeted microwave energy combined with a unique cooling mechanism that protects healthy tissue and enhances patient comfort while providing safe  effective  lasting relief from the symptoms of bph 
cooled thermotherapy can be performed without anesthesia or intravenous sedation and  as a result  can be performed in a physician s office or an outpatient clinic 
we believe cooled thermotherapy provides an efficacious  safe and cost effective solution for bph that is clinically superior to medication and is without the complications and side effects inherent in surgical procedures 
we believe that third party reimbursement is essential to the adoption of cooled thermotherapy  and that clinical efficacy  overall cost effectiveness and physician advocacy is key to obtaining this reimbursement 
we estimate that to of patients who receive treatment in the united states will be eligible for medicare coverage 
the remaining patients will either be covered by private insurers  including traditional indemnity health insurers and managed care organizations  or they will be private paying patients 
as a result  medicare reimbursement is particularly critical for widespread market adoption of cooled thermotherapy in the united states 
the level of medicare reimbursement for cooled thermotherapy is dependent on the site of service 
beginning on august   the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms replaced the reasonable cost basis of reimbursement for outpatient hospital based procedures  including cooled thermotherapy  with a new fixed rate or prospective payment system 
under this method of reimbursement  a hospital receives a fixed reimbursement for each cooled thermotherapy treatment performed in its facility  approximately  in calendar year  although the rate varies depending on a wage index and other factors for each hospital 
the urologist performing the cooled thermotherapy treatment receives reimbursement of approximately per procedure 
in january  cms began to reimburse for cooled thermotherapy treatments performed in the urologist s office 
the reimbursement rate inclusive of the physician s fee in calendar year for cooled thermotherapy procedures performed in the urologist s office is approximately  which is subject to geographic adjustment 
reimbursement rates for calendar year will be published in the november edition of the federal register 
in july  cms added the cpt code covering cooled thermotherapy to the asc list of medicare approved procedures providing a reimbursement rate for ambulatory surgical centers asc 
procedures in an asc are reimbursed under a two part system similar to hospital reimbursement 
the asc receives a fixed reimbursement for each cooled thermotherapy procedure performed 
cooled thermotherapy is in asc 
table of contents payment group which reimburses approximately  the highest amount allowed under this system 
the urologist performing the procedure is reimbursed the same amount as if the treatment occurred in a hospital 
this low facility reimbursement rate relative to the cost of the procedure potentially limits the number of cooled thermotherapy treatments done in an asc 
our goal is to grow cooled thermotherapy as a standard of care for the treatment of bph 
our business strategy to achieve this goal is to i increase the use of cooled thermotherapy by physicians who already have access to a cooled thermotherapy system  ii increase the number of physicians who provide cooled thermotherapy to their patients and iii satisfy additional demand for cooled thermotherapy systems through the efficient use of existing systems in the field 
we expect to continue to invest in sales and marketing programs and research and development projects as we focus on growing our revenues  continue clinical trials in support of regulatory and reimbursement approvals  and continue improving our therapy 
our future profitability will be dependent upon  among other factors  our success in achieving increased treatment volume and market adoption of the cooled thermotherapy procedures in the physician s office  our success in obtaining and maintaining necessary regulatory clearances  our ability to manufacture at the volumes and quantities the market requires  the extent to which medicare and other health care payers continue to reimburse costs of cooled thermotherapy procedures performed in physicians offices  hospitals  and ambulatory surgery centers and the amount of reimbursement provided 
critical accounting policies in accordance with securities and exchange commission guidance  we set forth below those material accounting policies that we believe are the most critical to an investor s understanding of our financial results and condition  and require complex management judgment 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from the sale of cooled thermotherapy system control units upon delivery to the customer 
we recognize revenue from treatment catheter sales at the time of shipment 
in addition to our sales of cooled thermotherapy system control units  we place our cooled thermotherapy system control units with customers under a variety of programs for both evaluation and long term use 
we retain title to these control units and do not recognize any revenue on these control units until title has transferred 
these programs are designed to expand access to our technology  and thus expand the market for our single use treatment catheters 
under these programs  we generally charge a higher price for each single use treatment catheter to include the use of our cooled thermotherapy system control unit by the customer 
we recognize revenue on these single use treatment catheters at the time of shipment 
revenue for warranty service contracts is deferred and recognized over the contract period 
we record a provision for estimated sales returns on product sales in the same period as the related revenue is recorded 
the provision for estimated sales returns is based on historical sales returns  analysis of credit memo data and other known factors 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
this allowance is a significant estimate and is regularly evaluated by us for adequacy by taking into consideration factors such as past experience  credit quality of the customer base  age of the receivable balances  both individually and in the aggregate  and current economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
product warranty we record a liability for warranty claims at the time of sale 
the amount of the liability is based on the trend in the historical ratio of product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs to sales  the historical 
table of contents length of time between the sale and resulting warranty claim and other factors 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or repair costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
inventories and related allowance for excess and obsolete inventory we value our inventories  consisting primarily of control units  single use treatment catheters  and raw materials to produce the control units and treatment catheters  at the lower of cost or market value on the first in  first out fifo basis 
the inventory cost includes both merchandise and freight 
a periodic review of the inventory on hand is performed to determine if the inventory is properly stated at the lower of cost or market 
in performing this analysis we consider  at a minimum  the following factors average selling prices  reimbursement changes  and changes in demand for our products due to competitive conditions or market acceptance 
each type of inventory is analyzed to determine net realizable values 
a provision is recorded to reduce the cost of inventories to the estimated net realizable values  if required 
we also analyze the level of inventory on hand on a periodic basis  in relation to estimated customer requirements to determine whether write downs for excess  obsolete  or slow moving inventory are required 
any significant or unanticipated change in the factors noted above could have a significant impact on the value of our inventories and on our reported operating results 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill in fiscal  we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  and as a result  we have ceased to amortize approximately million of goodwill and million of trademarks 
goodwill and trademarks are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if changes in circumstance or the occurrence of events suggests an impairment exists 
the test for impairment requires us to make several estimates about fair value  most of which are based on projected future cash flows 
our estimates associated with the impairment tests are considered critical  due to the amount of goodwill and trademarks recorded on our balance sheet and the judgment required in determining fair value amounts  including projected future cash flows 
other intangible assets consist of developed technologies  customer base and trademarks 
developed technologies and customer base are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives of and years  respectively 
the trademark asset is considered to be an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life  and it will not be amortized until its useful life is determined to be no longer indefinite 
we review the definite lived intangible assets for impairment as changes in circumstance or the occurrence of events suggests the remaining value is not recoverable 

table of contents results of operations fiscal years ended june  and net sales net sales increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the sales growth was primarily attributable to increased sales of single use treatment catheters at moderately higher average per unit selling prices  partially offset by a decrease in revenue from sales of cooled thermotherapy system control units 
although the number of control units sold increased slightly in fiscal compared to fiscal  a decrease in the average per unit sales price of these systems more than offset the increased unit volume 
sales of single use treatment catheters accounted for of revenue in fiscal  compared to in fiscal we believe that our sales and marketing efforts focused on improving office based utilization through physician education on the clinical benefits of cooled thermotherapy combined with the increased medicare reimbursement rate for cooled thermotherapy procedures performed in the urologist s office  which went into effect january   resulted in increased interest and demand for our products this year 
we expect demand for our treatment catheters to continue to increase as we continue to focus on increasing the utilization rates of our existing customers while economically providing access to our technology to new accounts through our scheduled access program and our mobile partners 
at june   we had a domestic installed base of cooled thermotherapy systems  including the units that are being used by customers pursuant to our evaluation and long term use programs  compared to an installed base of units at june  cost of goods sold and gross profit cost of goods sold includes raw materials  labor  overhead and royalties incurred in connection with the production of our cooled thermotherapy system control units and single use treatment catheters 
cost of goods sold for fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal  due primarily to higher sales volumes of both single use treatment catheters and control units  partially offset by lower per unit manufacturing costs 
additionally  fiscal cost of goods sold included a fiscal fourth quarter charge of  for a lower of cost or market write down of control unit inventory and fiscal cost of goods sold includes a  charge  recorded in the first fiscal quarter  for a commitment to purchase additional control unit inventory at prices which exceeded the expected future sales value 
gross profit as a percentage of sales increased to in fiscal from in the prior fiscal year 
the increase in the gross profit rate resulted primarily from the increased volume of higher margin single use treatment catheters sold in fiscal year  combined with a modest increase in the average per unit selling prices and a reduction in the average per unit manufacturing cost of single use treatment catheters  partially offset by a decrease in the average per unit selling price of cooled thermotherapy system control units 
additionally  fiscal gross profit rates were negatively impacted by the  charge described above 
we expect gross profit rates as a percentage of revenue to continue to improve as we focus on growing sales of our higher margin  single use treatment catheters 
selling  general administrative selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal decreased to million from million in fiscal the decrease in expense is attributable to the organizational restructuring and workforce reduction that occurred in the fourth fiscal quarter of  and a reduction in legal expenses related to the patent infringement suit we filed to protect our intellectual property that was settled in january we expect selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal to increase as we continue to invest in programs and resources designed to generate awareness and further acceptance of cooled thermotherapy 

table of contents research and development research and development expenses  which include expenditures for product development  regulatory compliance and clinical studies  decreased to million in fiscal from million in the prior fiscal year 
the decrease in expenses resulted primarily from the organizational restructuring and workforce reduction that occurred in the fourth fiscal quarter of  and decreased expenditures on product development activities and clinical trial expenses 
we expect research and development expenses to increase by approximately million in fiscal over fiscal  as we invest in programs designed to expand our cooled thermocath product line and further improve our technology 
amortization of other intangible assets amortization of other intangible assets was  for both fiscal and the amortization of intangible assets is a result of the purchase of the prostatron cooled thermotherapy product line from edap in october we expect amortization expense in fiscal to be approximately restructuring in may  we announced plans for organizational restructuring that eliminated positions within the company and also resulted in our vacating a portion of our leased facility 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal we recorded a million restructuring charge to cover the expenses associated with these items 
all of the targeted headcount reductions were completed by june  and we sublet the vacated space beginning in the second quarter of fiscal during fiscal  we recorded a  restructuring benefit  which resulted from a reduction in our severance obligations related to the may workforce reduction 
all severance obligations have been paid 
the lease term on the vacated space currently runs through fiscal net interest income net interest income for fiscal decreased to  from  in the prior fiscal year 
the decrease was due to lower interest income resulting from lower cash and investment balances  partially offset by lower interest expense 
fiscal years ended june  and net sales net sales for fiscal decreased million or to million  compared to sales of million in the prior fiscal year 
the decrease in revenue was caused by a decrease in the number of cooled thermotherapy system control units sold as well as a drop in the average per unit selling price of these systems  and a decrease in the number of single use treatment catheters sold 
sales of single use treatment catheters accounted for approximately of all revenue in fiscal compared to in fiscal both the volume of cooled thermotherapy system control units sold and the sales price of these systems were affected by competitive offerings in the marketplace 
in addition  the effort to expand our sales force during the first six months of fiscal limited the growth of treatment catheter sales as both sales management and our experienced sales representatives invested a significant amount of time recruiting and training new team members which reduced contact with existing customers and slowed the effort to generate new business 
at june  we had an installed base of cooled thermotherapy system control units  including the units that are being used by customers pursuant to our evaluation and long term use programs  compared to an installed base of units at june  cost of goods sold and gross profit cost of goods sold increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase in cost of goods sold resulted primarily from a  charge for a lower of cost or market adjustment 
table of contents to cooled thermotherapy system control unit inventory and future control unit purchase commitments  partially offset by reduced volumes of cooled thermotherapy system control units and single use treatment catheters sold 
gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal  due primarily to the decrease in the average per unit selling price of our cooled thermotherapy system control units and the  charge to cost of goods sold in the fourth quarter of fiscal for the lower of cost or market adjustment to cooled thermotherapy system control unit inventory and future purchase commitments 
selling  general administrative selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in the prior fiscal year 
the increase in expenses resulted from the expansion of our direct sales force during the first six months of fiscal and expenses related to a patent infringement suit that we filed to protect our intellectual property 
research and development research and development expenses decreased to million in fiscal from million in the prior fiscal year 
the decrease in research and development expenses resulted from decreased expenditures on product development activities partially offset by increased clinical study activity 
amortization of other intangible assets amortization of other intangible assets was  in fiscal  as well as fiscal restructuring restructuring expense for fiscal totaled million compared to no restructuring expense in fiscal this restructuring action was initiated in may and concluded in june approximately million of this charge related to severance and company paid benefit expenses associated with the elimination of positions and approximately  related to vacated leased space resulting from a facility consolidation 
net interest income net interest income decreased to  during fiscal from  in the prior fiscal year 
the decrease was attributable to lower interest income due to lower cash and investment balances partially offset by lower interest expense 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations since inception through sales of equity securities and  to a lesser extent  sales of our cooled thermotherapy system control units and single use treatment catheters 
as of june   we had total cash  cash equivalents and available for sale investments of million compared million as of june  the increase in cash  cash equivalents  and available for sale investments resulted primarily from the significant improvement in operating results in fiscal  combined with approximately million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
cash provided by operating activities during fiscal  we generated million of cash from operating activities 
our net earnings of  combined with depreciation and amortization of million accounted for the majority of the cash generated 
decreases in inventory and prepaid and other assets of  and  respectively  favorably impacted cash  but were offset by increases in accounts receivable of  and decreases in accounts payable and accrued expenses and deferred income of  and  respectively 
the decrease in inventory 
table of contents resulted from a reduction in both raw material and finished goods inventory associated with control units 
prepaid and other assets decreased due to the elimination of a down payment made in the fourth quarter of fiscal for inventory that was delivered in fiscal  and the expensing of royalties and insurance premiums that were paid in prior periods 
the  increase in accounts receivable was related to significantly increased revenue volume in fiscal  and the decrease in accrued expenses and deferred income resulted from payments of severance and lease obligations associated with the may restructuring and a  adjustment to the restructuring reserve  combined with payments to our attorneys for previously incurred expenses associated with our patent litigation  partially offset by an increase in accrued compensation associated with our annual employee bonus program and increased sales commissions 
cash provided by investing activities we generated million from investing activities  resulting from the sale and maturity of million of available for sale investments partially offset by the purchase of  of property and equipment 
we expect capital expenditures in fiscal to be consistent with fiscal levels 
cash provided by financing activities during fiscal we generated  from financing activities as a result of million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options  partially offset by  of payments on capital lease obligations that were concluded during the third quarter of fiscal  and a  debt payment to edap tms sa edap 
on december   a final payment of  including interest  was due to edap under a promissory note dated october  in the original principal amount of  issued to edap by us pursuant to an asset purchase agreement dated the same date the note 
pursuant to the terms of the note  on december   we paid edap  of accrued interest and  of principal and have deferred payment of  for offset against future anticipated product claims against edap 
we plan to continue offering customers a variety of programs for both evaluation and long term use of our cooled thermotherapy system control units in addition to purchase options 
as of june   our property and equipment  net  included approximately million of control units used in evaluation or long term use programs 
depending on the growth of these programs  we may use additional capital to finance the units used by these customers 
future contractual commitments  including interest  that will affect cash flows are as follows in thousands total note payable building lease total we have no contractual commitments beyond fiscal year as of june   we have purchase commitments totaling  to edap for the purchase of prostatron control units for scheduled delivery in fiscal based upon our financial performance in fiscal  we believe our million in cash  cash equivalents  and available for sale investments at june   together with the funds generated from operations  will be sufficient to fund our working capital and capital resources needs for the next months 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will not require additional financing in the future or that any additional financing will be available to us on satisfactory terms  if at all 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our financial instruments include cash  cash equivalents  and available for sale investments 
our financial investment portfolio at june   is carried at market value 
increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in the fair value of these instruments 
also  fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments may be affected by the credit worthiness of the issuer  prepayment options  relative values of alternative instruments  the liquidity of the instrument and other general market conditions 
market risk was estimated as the potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates for the issues contained in the available for sale investment portfolio and was not materially different from the year end carrying value 
due to the nature of our short term investments  we have concluded that we do not have a material market risk exposure 
our policy is not to enter into derivative financial instruments 
we do not have any significant foreign currency exposure since we do not generally transact business in foreign currencies 
therefore  we do not have significant overall currency exposure 
in addition  we do not enter into any futures or forward commodity contracts since we do not have significant market risk exposure with respect to commodity prices
