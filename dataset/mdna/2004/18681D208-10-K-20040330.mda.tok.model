the company commenced operations on august  during the period from inception until early  the company was primarily engaged in developing software for the relationship manager formerly referred to as the extranet manager 
in and  the company was also engaged in developing internet websites and providing related consulting services 
the company implemented the first click commerce relationship manager in the second quarter of effective as of march   the company acquired allegis corporation allegis  a privately held california corporation engaged in licensing partner relationship management software and providing professional implementation services  hosting  and maintenance services related to its software 
results of allegis operations have been included in the company s consolidated financial statements since march  allegis  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  broadened the company s installed base and product offerings and expanded its market share within the partner relationship management area especially in the high technology and financial services verticals 
allegis contributed revenues related to hosting and license subscriptions as well as adding additional software license  maintenance and professional services revenues to the consolidated results 
prior to the allegis acquisition  the company did not sell hosting and license subscriptions 
however  as a result of the integration of allegis personnel and products  the common business problems we solve and the common management team  we have presented the business overview and results of click commerce and allegis on a consolidated basis 
the company focused its efforts in on achieving profitability 
in the second half of  the company reported profits of approximately million 
the company s goal of continuing to achieve profitable operations is the primary focus of management 
the company plans to continue investing in developing new and improved product offerings and in increasing the exposure of the company s products and services through its targeted marketing programs 
the company believes that each investment must be prudently made and justified by the expected return on such investment 
with the acquisition of allegis  the company now offers several licensing and service options for its software products 
customers can either purchase a perpetual software license or enter into a subscription license contract 
customers may also choose to use our hosting services for their software license or install the software on servers within their own internal environment 
subscription licenses are only available to customers who also use our hosting services 
perpetual license revenues and professional services are typically recognized as the software or service is delivered and do not provide a contractual  predictable future revenue stream 
the recurring revenue opportunities come from subscriptions or maintenance and hosting services 
while the company may have better visibility of future revenue from subscription licenses  our customers make the final decision on the form of their software license 
we encourage all of our customers to use our hosting services 
the company depends on several factors to increase revenue and maintain profitability adding new customers  maintaining its current base of subscription  hosting and maintenance revenues  and improving the gross margins of our professional services 
adding new customers is the primary responsibility of the sales department 
maintaining the other revenue streams is the responsibility of our professional services department 
the company has developed compensations structures for these departments that it believes provides appropriate incentives for achievement of their respective goals 
the company s revenue is principally derived from sales of perpetual licenses or subscriptions to its software 
the click commerce software suite consists of the partner portal platform and eighteen business applications 
the company also recognizes revenue from services  including business consulting  implementation  maintenance  training and managed hosting services 
cost of product license revenues includes production and shipping expenses  which are expensed as incurred  as well as costs of licensing third party software incorporated into or required by the company s products 
these third party license costs are expensed as the products are delivered on perpetual licenses or subscriptions or as maintenance to the extent that the third party license costs related to those product offerings 
cost of service revenues include salaries and related expenses for professional services and technical support personnel who provide implementation services  maintenance and hosting services  as well as an allocation of data processing and overhead costs which are expensed as incurred 
operating expenses are classified into five general categories sales and marketing  research and development  general and administrative  amortization of stock based compensation and amortization of intangible assets 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs for sales and marketing personnel  sales commissions  travel  public relations and marketing materials 
research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs to support product development 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs for executive management  finance and administrative employees  legal and accounting services  and corporate liability insurance 
amortization of stock based compensation represents the amortization over the related service period of the difference between the exercise price of options granted and the deemed fair market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant  as well as amortization of the warrant issued in connection with a joint marketing agreement with accenture 
since the company reached an agreement with accenture to cancel the warrant in the fourth quarter of  no amortization expense of the warrant is reflected in the accompanying statements of operations for amortization of intangible assets represents amortization expense for certain customer relationships with finite useful lives  which was recorded in connection with the acquisition of allegis corporation during the first quarter of in april  the company issued a warrant to accenture ltd 
accenture to purchase up to  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the warrant vested contingently upon the achievement of certain milestones  primarily the generation of license revenue for the company  and was set to expire on april  the warrant contained a significant cash penalty for accenture s failure to meet the agreed revenue target by the expiration date  and  accordingly  the fair value of the warrant was determined on the date of grant in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
and statement of financial accounting standards no 
to be approximately million  which was determined using the black scholes option pricing model 
this amount was included in additional paid in capital and had been amortized to expense over the original vesting period of the warrant 
in the fourth quarter of  the company reached an agreement with accenture to cancel the warrant 
under this agreement  accenture relinquished its rights under the warrant in exchange for the company accepting an accelerated payment of a reduced penalty related to the level of revenue delivered through the accenture relationship and relinquishing its rights under the warrant 
the reduced penalty was received by the company and was reported in its financial statements in other income in the fourth quarter of upon cancellation of the warrant  the company adjusted the cumulative amortization expense to reflect only the percentage of the original fair value of the warrant that was vested on the date of cancellation  resulting in a reversal of the previously recognized amortization of stock based compensation expense of million in the fourth quarter of for the year ended december   the company recognized  in net amortization recovery related to the warrant 
the company believes that period to period comparisons of operating results should not be relied upon as predictive of future performance 
the company s prospects must be considered in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties encountered by companies at an early stage of development  particularly companies in new  rapidly evolving markets 
the company may not be successful in addressing such risks and difficulties 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
as such  the company makes certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that it believes are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
the accounting policies and estimates which the company believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating the company s reported financial results include the following revenue recognition the company s revenue is derived from sales of licenses of its software  consisting of the partner portal platform which includes the relationship manager  portal framework and the commerce suite the click commerce developer studio and fourteen business applications  as well as from needs analyses  professional services  training  maintenance and support 
the company s software is generally licensed on either a perpetual basis or through a subscription 
revenues related to arrangements with multiple elements are allocated to the individual elements in accordance with revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf based upon verifiable  objective evidence of the fair values of each accounting unit 
inherent in the revenue recognition process are significant estimates and judgments  which determine the timing and amount of revenue recognition 
beginning in  the company began to license its software products independent of its integration services 
for those contracts that either do not contain a services component or in which the services element is not essential to the functionality of any other element of the contract  software license revenue is recognized upon delivery of the company s software  provided that the fee is fixed and determinable  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and collection of the resulting receivable is considered probable 
for contracts in which the services component meets the requirements of a separate element of a contract  revenue is recognized as the services are performed 
the revenue to be recognized from multiple element software contracts is based on the fair value of each element 
if company specific objective evidence of fair value does not exist for one or more of the delivered elements  but the company has such evidence for all of the undelivered elements  the company applies the residual method of accounting and defers only that revenue related to the undelivered elements 
if there are any discounts negotiated in the contract  the discount is attributed entirely to the delivered elements 
the company records deferred revenue on software contracts for which it has billed or collected amounts  but for which the requirements for revenue recognition have not been met 
in accordance with eitf no 
 the company characterizes the reimbursement of out of pocket expenses from their customers as revenue  rather than as a reduction of the related expense in the statement of operations 
revenue from contracts in which the company s services are essential to the functionality of the other elements of the contract is recognized using the percentage of completion method under contract accounting as services are performed or output milestones are reached  as the company delivers  customizes and installs the software 
the percentage completed is measured either by the percentage of labor hours incurred to date in relation to estimated total labor hours or in consideration of achievement of certain output milestones  depending on the specific nature of each contract 
when output milestones are used  those milestones are typically determined from the structure of the contract in three milestones delivery of the software  completion of the initial implementation and acceptance of the project by the customer 
for arrangements in which percentage of completion accounting is used  the company records cash receipts from customers and billed amounts due from customers in excess of recognized revenue as billings in excess of revenues earned on contracts in progress 
the timing and amount of cash receipts from customers can vary significantly depending on specific contract terms and can  therefore  have a significant impact on the amount of billings in excess of revenues earned on contracts in progress at the end of any given period 
revenue from contracts recognized under the percentage of completion method based on milestones is presented as product license revenue to the extent that the underlying milestones are related to software deliveries 
in contracts with revenue recognized under the percentage of completion method based on labor hour inputs  revenues are presented as product revenue to the extent that the underlying contracts are for software licenses based on equal application of discounts across all elements of a larger engagement 
to the extent that hours of input are used as the basis for percentage completed on a fixed price contract or that contract milestones relate to software customization or other professional services  revenues are presented as service revenues 
for software subscriptions  the company applies revenue recognition principles in accordance with the guidance provided by staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition 
the arrangement fee related to multi element arrangements should be allocated to the individual elements in accordance with eitf based upon verifiable  objective evidence of the fair values of each accounting unit 
the company s subscription arrangements with customers generally include several elements  including strategic consulting services  set up and software subscription services  and hosting services 
set up and subscription are presented as subscription revenues 
if the arrangement includes consulting or hosting services  those elements are presented as service and hosting revenue  respectively  based on the individual contracts 
total arrangement revenues and direct costs are deferred until customer acceptance has occurred and the software subscription service begins 
revenues and direct costs are then amortized ratably to revenue and expense over the noncancelable contractual term  which is normally months 
maintenance service is sold separately under contracts that are renewable annually and is provided only to customers who purchase maintenance 
the company recognizes maintenance service revenue ratably over the contract period  generally one year 
maintenance fees are generally billed annually in advance and are recorded as deferred revenue 
as part of the sales process  the company often performs a needs analysis for the potential customer on a fixed fee basis 
revenue from needs analyses is recognized as the work is performed 
training revenue is recognized as the services are provided 
accounts receivable the company continuously monitors collections and payments from its customers and maintains a provision for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that are identified 
while such credit losses have historically not been material and within expectations and the provisions established  the company cannot guarantee that it will continue to have the same credit loss rates that have been experienced in the past 
income taxes the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
in assessing the realizablility of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
although future taxable income of the company may be sufficient to utilize a substantial amount of the benefits of the company s net operating loss carryforwards and to realize its deferred tax assets  a valuation allowance was recorded in to completely offset the carrying value of the company s net deferred tax assets as management concluded that the realization of its deferred tax assets does not meet the more likely than not criteria under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
the company recorded an addition to the valuation allowance of million in and million in  equal to the amount of the future tax asset generated
