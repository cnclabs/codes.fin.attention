overview we operate mid sized warehouse club style stores in the united states territories  foreign island countries in the pacific and the caribbean  the hawaiian islands and sonora  california 
our primary strategy is to operate in island markets  offering predominately us branded goods 
we currently operate eleven retail stores as follows two stores in each of hawaii and guam  and one store in each of st 
thomas  st 
croix  american samoa  fiji  curacao  st 
maarten and sonora  california 
on december   our two stores on the island of guam suffered damage from supertyphoon pongsona  resulting in the immediate closure of both stores 
our tamuning store lost its generator in the storm  but reopened shortly thereafter on december th 
our dededo store  however  suffered more significant damage  and had to be closed for reconstruction 
the store was rebuilt and it reopened for business on october  our stores are patterned after the warehouse club concept  although the stores i are smaller averaging approximately  square feet vs 
large format warehouse clubs of approximately  square feet  ii generally target niche markets  mainly us territories  us island states and foreign island countries  where demographics do not support large format warehouse clubs  iii carry a wide assortment of local and ethnic food items  and iv do not charge a membership fee 
although we do not have large seasonal fluctuations in sales  the fourth quarter is typically the highest sales quarter due to additional holiday sales 
our management focus relative to our core island store operations includes reviewing our merchandising strategies  both those that apply to all stores and those specific to each store in light of the different conditions in each market 
during we opened no new stores other than the reopening of our dededo  guam store 
however  we are in the process of analyzing opportunities in selected markets and relocation opportunities for existing stores with leases expiring in the next one to two years 
while we believe these actions can improve profitability  there can be no assurance that these actions will be successful 
we also continue to explore ways to maximize long term value for our shareholders  including focusing on efforts to increase earnings  responding to competition  and improving same store sales and gross margins 
we believe the number of new island markets with the attributes for our existing growth strategy is limited as a result of  among other things  changing market conditions 
we are currently evaluating alternative methods of implementing future expansion 
on june   we confirmed that we were engaged in discussions with assi  inc concerning a potential acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of our common stock 
on october   we announced that the discussion with assi regarding an acquisition of our outstanding common stock was no longer active  but that we were continuing discussions regarding a potential cash investment in unregistered newly issued shares of our common stock 
on november   we announced that discussions with assi regarding a potential investment in newly issued shares had terminated 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of our net sales represented by certain consolidated income statement data 
fiscal year ended december  december  december  net sales gross margin operating expenses store general and administrative store opening operating income interest expense  net other income expense income before income taxes income tax provision net income fiscal compared to fiscal during fiscal  we experienced improvements in comparable store sales and gross margin  which resulted in higher net income and eps 
these improvements were due to several factors including better sourcing  pricing  merchandising and mix of goods in the our stores 
we also experienced a successful reopening of our dededo  guam store  which had sufferered substantial damage from supertyphoon ponsonga on december   forcing it to close 
the store was rebuilt and reopened on october  as a result of the reopening of our dededo  guam store  we expect our fiscal sales to increase as compared to net sales 
net sales in fiscal of million increased as compared to net sales of million for the comparable period in the prior year 
the improvement in sales came despite the nine month closure of our dededo  guam  store and lower business to business sales in the current year  as nine of our other ten stores experienced comparable sales increases 
we expect the level of business to business activity during fiscal to be consistent with fiscal levels 
comparable store sales stores open for a full months increased during fiscal as compared to fiscal comparable store sales are calculated on stores excluding the guam market as our store in tamuning  guam benefited from the temporary closure of our dededo store 
including the tamuning store  same store sales increased during fiscal as compared to fiscal during the fourth quarter of  we experienced comparable store sales increases of as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal gross margin 
gross margin improved to million  or of sales  in fiscal from million  or of sales  in fiscal the increase in gross profit as a percent of sales resulted primarily from improvements in merchandising  inventory management and a stronger mix of retail store sales  with typically higher margins  as compared to business to business sales  which generally provide a lower gross margin but are executed at minimal direct expense 
store expenses 
store expenses remained flat at million  or of sales  for fiscal as compared to million  or of sales  in fiscal during fiscal  increases in insurance  utilities and volume related expenses such as payroll and bank bankcard fees were offset by a million reduction in store expenses attributable to the nine month closure of our dededo  guam  store 
as a percent of sales  payroll actually declined in as compared to general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expenses increased to million  or of sales  in fiscal  as compared to million  or of sales  in fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to a million write down of idle fixed assets from previously closed stores and the acceleration of depreciation of leasehold improvements related to our corporate office  as well as transaction costs incurred in connection with our discussions with assi regarding various strategic transactions 
on november   we announced that discussions with assi regarding those strategic transactions had been terminated 
store opening expense 
store opening expenses were  in fiscal  as compared to  in fiscal store opening expenses in fiscal primarily relate to the reopening of our dededo  guam store 
store opening expense in fiscal relate to costs associated with the evaluation of potential new store locations 
net interest expense 
interest expense  net increased to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to commitment fees and the higher interest rate approximately higher than associated with our new line of credit entered into on april  other income expense other income of million in fiscal includes a gain of million related to the receipt of insurance reimbursements for damage to inventory and equipment sustained from the supertyphoon in guam and gains of million on foreign currency transactions  and translation of intercompany balances for transactions that exceed the permanent investments in those countries 
other expense of million in fiscal includes expense of million related to losses sustained from the supertyphoon that we did not expect to recover from insurance  offset by gains of million on foreign currency transactions and translation 
the income on foreign currency in both fiscal years is primarily attributable to appreciation in the fijian dollar as compared to the us dollar 
income tax provision 
we recorded a tax provision in fiscal of million or of pre tax income 
the tax provision represents taxes associated with income generated in the us and us territories 
no taxes or tax benefits were provided on foreign pre tax losses in fiscal  as we cannot predict whether we will be able to generate an adequate amount of taxable income in the future to utilize such benefits 
as of december   we have foreign net operating loss carryforwards nol s of approximately million  which  if not utilized  will begin expiring in the year nol s in curacao and st 
maarten of approximately million are not subject to expiration time limits 
our ability to utilize the nol s carryforwards is dependent upon generating taxable income in the foreign jurisdictions 
as a result  we have recorded a valuation allowance of million attributable to the million of tax benefits recorded for net operating loss carryforwards 
we had tax credit carryforwards of million as of december   expiring between and during  we were able to utilize a portion of the tax credit carryforward 
we expect to be able to fully utilize the remaining tax credit carryforward of million and therefore no valuation allowance is provided 
net income 
our net income was million  or per fully diluted share  in fiscal  compared to net income of million  or per fully diluted share  in fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal net sales 
net sales in fiscal of million declined as compared to net sales of million for the comparable period in the prior year 
the slight decline in net sales was primarily due to lower business to business sales in the current year as compared to particularly strong sales in the prior year 
conversely  comparable store sales stores open for a full months increased during fiscal as compared to fiscal  as decreased sales in guam were more than offset by sales increases in a majority of our other stores

no taxes or tax benefits were provided on foreign pre tax losses in fiscal  as we cannot predict whether we will be able to generate an adequate amount of taxable income in the future to utilize such benefits 
as of december   we had foreign net operating loss carryforwards nol s of approximately million  which  if not utilized  will begin expiring in the year nol s in curacao and st 
maarten of approximately million are not subject to expiration time limits 
our ability to utilize the nol carryforwards is dependent upon generating taxable income in the foreign jurisdictions 
as a result  we have recorded a valuation allowance of million attributable to the net operating loss carryforwards 
we had foreign tax credit carryforwards of million as of december   expiring between and during fiscal  we were able to utilize most of the foreign tax credit carryforwards 
we expect to be able to fully utilize the remaining foreign tax credit carryforward of million and  therefore  no valuation allowance is provided 
net income 
our net income decreased to  or per share  for fiscal  compared to net income of  or per share in fiscal liquidity and capital resources we currently finance our operations with proceeds from various credit facilities  and internally generated funds 
net cash provided by operations was million  million and million  for fiscal years  and  respectively 
the increase in net cash provided by operation in as compared to was primarily due to an increase in net income of million  an increase in accrued expenses of million  the receipt of insurance proceeds and payments received on accounts receivable of million 
the decrease in net cash provided by operations in as compared to was primarily due to the establishment of a receivable for assets lost as a result of supertyphoon pongsona in guam and use of cash to reduce accrued expenses 
net cash used in investing activities was million  million and million  for fiscal years  and  respectively 
the cash used in investing activities in primarily relates to the reopening of our dededo  guam store 
cash was used in fiscal and fiscal for general store improvements 
currently  we have no plans to open new stores during  but we are in the process of exploring expansion opportunities in selected markets and relocation opportunities for existing stores with leases expiring in the next one to two years 
net cash used by financing activities of million in fiscal was used to reduce the balance on our line of credit 
net cash used by financing activities of million in fiscal was due to reductions in the outstanding borrowings on our long term debt  partially offset by additional borrowings on our line of credit 
in fiscal  the million of net cash used by financing activities was due to the reduction of both our line of credit and our long term debt 
foreign currency translation resulted in a gain of  in fiscal and losses of million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
the foreign currency translation gains and losses are a result of the translation of our subsidiaries operating results and balance sheets from local currencies to u 
s 
dollars 
on april   we entered into a line of credit with wells fargo business credit that has a three year term  expiring on april  the line of credit consists of a million committed  secured revolving credit line with a sublimit for letters of credit and bankers acceptances in the amount up to million 
at december   there were million in borrowings outstanding on the line of credit  million utilized for standby letters of credit and million set aside for other reserves 
borrowings are limited to the lesser of million or the amount calculated under the borrowing base 
the borrowing base is equal to the lesser of a  or b the sum of of eligible inventory in the united states of america  plus of eligible inventory in the us virgin islands and guam  less specified reserves 
borrowings under the new line of credit bear interest at the financial institution s prime rate plus at december  
a fee of is charged on the unused portion of the line of credit 
the line of credit contains various covenants  including a requirement that we maintain minimum pre tax income and tangible net worth and limitations on acquisitions  additional debt  change in control and capital expenditures 
we believe that we are currently in compliance with all such covenants 
on march   the company and wells fargo business credit entered into the second amendment to credit and security agreement 
the amendment provides for the following i an immediate reduction in the interest rate on the line of credit of one half of one percent  ii a further reduction in the interest rate of one half of one percent if we meet certain net income levels from december   through june   and iii the adoption of new measurement values for fiscal prior to april   we maintained a million line of credit with a different commercial bank 
this line of credit was satisfied and terminated on april  a significant portion of our cash flow is generated by our operations 
if our operating results deteriorate  as a result of a decrease in customer demand or severe pricing pressures from our customers or our competitors  our ability to generate positive cash flow from operations may be jeopardized 
we believe that amounts available under our various credit facilities  existing cash available for working capital purposes  and cash flow from operations will most likely be sufficient to fund our operations through the next months 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional financing when needed  or that any available financing will be on terms acceptable to us 
contractual obligations as of december   our commitments to make future payments under long term contractual obligations were as follows in thousands payments due by period less than to to after contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt   operating leases      capital lease total      adjusted to reflect i new rental payments negotiated in february for our lease at dededo  guam  and ii rental payments associated with the march exercise of our first five year option to extend our sonora lease 
represents rental payments associated with our january equipment lease for certain guam assets 
critical accounting policies we have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to report accurately and fairly our operating results and financial position  and we apply those accounting policies in a consistent manner 
the significant accounting policies are summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we base our estimates on historical experience and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical in the preparation of our financial statements because they involve the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
inventories inventories are carried at the lower of average cost or market 
we provide for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts on the basis of a percentage of sales 
the provision is adjusted periodically to reflect the trend of actual physical inventory count results 
long lived assets when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of long lived assets  including intangibles  may be impaired  an evaluation of the recoverability is performed by comparing the carrying value of the assets to projected future cash flows 
upon indication that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable  the company recognizes an impairment loss by a charge against current operations 
foreign currency translation the us dollar is the functional currency for all our locations  except for fiji and netherlands antilles  where the local currency is the functional currency 
prior to the closure of our new zealand stores in june  the functional currency for new zealand was its local currency 
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the applicable exchange rate on the balance sheet date 
net sales costs and expenses are translated at the average rates of exchange prevailing during the period 
adjustments resulting from this process are reported  net of taxes  as accumulated other comprehensive income loss  a component of shareholders equity 
realized and unrealized gains on foreign currency transactions are included in other income expense 
the cumulative translation adjustment resulting from a net investment in a country is recognized as income or expense in the period we substantially liquidated operations in that country 
income taxes income tax expense includes us and foreign income taxes 
we account for income taxes under the liability method 
under the liability method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities  and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
we apply judgment in determining whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized  and valuation allowances are established when necessary 
our effective tax rate is currently higher than the expected federal statutory rate because valuation allowances have been established against the tax benefits of foreign losses  as we have no assurance that we will be able to generate an adequate amount of taxable income in the future to utilize such benefits 
we are developing and implementing certain tax planning strategies  which may affect our ability to recognize some of the deferred tax assets that are currently allowed for and may ultimately change our estimate of the valuation allowance 
accounting pronouncements during  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for asset retirement obligations and  during  the fasb issued sfas no  accounting for costs associated with exit and disposal activities 
the adoption of sfas nos 
and during fiscal did not have a material impact on the our consolidated financial statements

as such  the adoption of eitf no 
during fiscal did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
additionally  in november  the fasb ratified the eitf s consensus on issue application of issue by resellers to sales incentives offered to consumers by manufacturers which amends eitf according to the amended guidance  if certain criteria are met  consideration received by a reseller in the form of reimbursement from a vendor for honoring the vendor s sales incentives offered directly to consumers ie manufacturer s coupons should not be recorded as a reduction of the cost of the reseller s purchases from the vendor 
the adoption of eitf during fiscal did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation  consolidation of variable interest entities fin 
fin interprets arb no 
 consolidated financial statements  as amended by fasb statement no 
 consolidation of all majority owned subsidiaries  which requires the preparation of consolidated financial statements when one entity has a controlling financial interest in a second entity 
fin specifies disclosures that are required for financial statements issued after january  but prior to the effective date of the interpretation for entities created before february  and interests in those entities acquired before that date  as well as disclosures that will be required for financial statements of primary beneficiaries and others with variable interests in variable interest entities issued after the effective date 
additionally  in december  the fasb issued fasb interpretation revised  consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 
fin r  which provided  among other things  immediate deferral of the application of fin for entities which did not originally qualify as special purpose entities  and provided additional scope exceptions for joint ventures with business operations and franchises 
our adoption of these interpretations did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position  as we do not have variable interest entities 
in april  the fasb issued statement no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the statement amends and clarifies accounting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities under statement we believe that our adoption of this new accounting standard will not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position  as we do not have derivatives nor do we participate in hedging activities 
in may  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
the statement requires that certain financial instruments  which under previous guidance were accounted for as equity  must now be accounted for as liabilities 
this statement is effective for all financial instruments entered into or modified after may  the adoption of sfas no during fiscal did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we operate stores in foreign countries and have market risks associated with foreign currencies 
however  sales are primarily made in us cash or foreign currencies with minimal trade credit extended and no borrowings exist in foreign currencies 
cash deposited from sales are remitted back to the us bank account  routinely 
we record gains and losses on foreign currency transactions  and translation of intercompany balances for transactions that exceed the permanent investments in those countries in other income expense 
gains and losses are primarily attributable to appreciation and depreciation in the fijian dollar as compared to the us dollar 
we have also assessed our vulnerability to interest rate risk associated with our financial instruments  including  cash and cash equivalents  lines of credit and long term debt 
due to the nature of these financial instruments  we believe that the risk associated with interest rate fluctuations does not pose a material risk 
our line of credit and long term debt can be expected to vary in the future as a result of future business requirements  market conditions and other factors 
we do not have any derivative financial instruments as of december
