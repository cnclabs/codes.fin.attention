other supplemental data ebitda the company defines ebitda as earnings before interest expense and income  provision for income taxes  depreciation  amortization  loss on early extinguishment of debt and cumulative effect of a change in accounting principles 
management uses ebitda as a relevant and useful measure to compare operating results among its properties and between accounting periods 
the presentation of ebitda has economic substance because it is used by management as a performance measure to analyze the performance of the company s business segments 
ebitda is specifically relevant in evaluating large  long lived hotel casino projects because it provides a perspective on the current effects of operating decisions separated from the substantial  non operational depreciation charges and financing costs of such projects 
additionally  management believes some investors consider ebitda to be a useful measure in determining a company s ability to service or incur indebtedness and for estimating a company s underlying cash flow from operations before capital costs  taxes and capital expenditures 
ebitda  subject to certain adjustments  is also a measure used in debt covenants in the company s debt agreements 
ebitda is not a measure of financial performance under the promulgations of generally accepted accounting principles or gaap 
unlike net income  ebitda does not include depreciation or interest expense and therefore does not reflect current or future capital expenditures or the cost of capital 
management compensates for these limitations by using ebitda as only one of several comparative tools  together with gaap measurements  to assist in the evaluation of operating performance and to measure cash flow generated by ongoing operations 
such gaap measurements include operating income loss  net income loss  cash flows from operations and cash flow data 
ebitda is not calculated in the same manner by 
table of contents all companies and accordingly  may not be an appropriate measure of comparing performance amongst different companies
