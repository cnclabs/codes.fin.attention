item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the objective of this section is to help shareholders and potential investors understand our views on our results of operations and financial condition 
you should read this discussion in conjunction with the financial statements and notes to the financial statements that appear elsewhere in this report 
overview income we have two primary sources of pre tax income 
the first is net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income which is the income that we earn on our loans and investments and interest expense which is the interest that we pay on our deposits and borrowings 
our second principal source of pre tax income is fee income the compensation we receive from providing products and services 
most of our fee income comes from service charges on now accounts and fees for late loan payments 
we also earn fee income from atm charges  insurance commissions  safe deposit box rentals and other fees and charges 
we occasionally recognize gains or losses as a result of sales of investment securities or foreclosed real estate 
these gains and losses are not a regular part of our income 
expenses the expenses we incur in operating our business consist of compensation and benefits expenses  occupancy expenses  equipment and data processing expense  deposit insurance premiums  advertising expenses  expenses for foreclosed real estate and other miscellaneous expenses 
compensation and benefits consist primarily of the salaries and wages paid to our employees  fees paid to our directors and expenses for retirement and other employee benefits 
occupancy expenses  which are the fixed and variable costs of building and equipment  consist primarily of lease payments  real estate taxes  depreciation charges  maintenance and costs of utilities 
equipment and data processing expense includes fees paid to our third party data processing service and expenses and depreciation charges related to office and banking equipment 
depreciation of premises and equipment is computed using the straight line and accelerated methods based on the useful lives of the related assets 
estimated lives are five to years for building and improvements  and three to years for furniture and equipment 
deposit insurance premiums are payments we make to the federal deposit insurance corporation for insurance of our deposit accounts 
expenses for foreclosed real estate include maintenance and repairs on foreclosed properties prior to sale 
other expenses include expenses for attorneys  accountants and consultants  payroll taxes  franchise taxes  charitable contributions  insurance  office supplies  postage  telephone and other miscellaneous operating expenses 
critical accounting policies we consider accounting policies involving significant judgments and assumptions by management that have  or could have  a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets or on income to be critical 
table of contents accounting policies 
we consider the following to be our critical accounting policies allowance for loan losses and deferred income taxes 
allowance for loan losses 
determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses necessarily involves a high degree of judgment 
management reviews the level of the allowance on a monthly basis and establishes the provision for loan losses based on the composition of the loan portfolio  delinquency levels  loss experience  economic condition and other factors related to the collectibility of the loan portfolio 
although we believe that we use the best information available to establish the allowance for loan losses  future additions to the allowance may be necessary based on estimates that are susceptible to change as a result of changes in economic conditions and other factors 
in addition  the office of thrift supervision  as an integral part of its examination process  periodically reviews our allowance for loan losses 
such agency may require us to recognize adjustments to the allowance based on its judgments about information available to it at the time of its examination 
deferred income taxes 
we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
if current available information raises doubt as to the realization of the deferred tax assets  a valuation allowance is established 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
we exercise significant judgment in evaluating the amount and timing of recognition of the resulting tax liabilities and assets  including projections of future taxable income 
these judgments and estimates are reviewed on a continual basis as regulatory and business factors change

our primary source of funds is our deposit accounts 
the deposit base is comprised of checking  savings  money market and time deposits 
these deposits are provided primarily by individuals and businesses within our market area 
we do not use brokered deposits as a source of funding 
we have adjusted our pricing strategy to encourage the run off of higher rate certificates of deposit and to increase transaction accounts  which has resulted in the loss of some deposits 
in the past  we offered interest rates on certificates of deposit that were substantially above market rates 
our current deposit pricing structure is more consistent with market rates 
although the change in pricing strategy resulted in the loss of some deposits  we do not expect that we will continue to experience a significant decline in certificates of deposit as a result of our current pricing structure

allowance for loan losses and asset quality allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is a valuation allowance for probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
we evaluate the need to establish reserves against losses on loans on a monthly basis 
when additional reserves are necessary  a provision for loan losses is charged to earnings 
in connection with assessing the allowance  we consider the level of subprime loans held in the portfolio and delinquency levels and loss experience with respect to subprime and prime loans 
in addition  we assess the allowance using factors that cannot be associated with specific credit or loan categories 
these factors include our subjective evaluation of local and national economic and business conditions  portfolio concentration and changes in the character and size of the loan portfolio 
the allowance methodology reflects our objective that the overall allowance appropriately reflects a margin for the imprecision necessarily inherent in estimates of expected credit losses 

table of contents the office of thrift supervision  as an integral part of its examination process  periodically reviews our allowance for loan losses 
the office of thrift supervision may require us to make additional provisions for loan losses based on judgments different from ours 
due to net charge offs  the allowance for loan losses decreased  to million at june  there were no additions to the allowance for loan losses during the fiscal year 
at june   our allowance for loan losses represented of total gross loans and of nonperforming loans  compared to of total gross loans and of nonperforming loans at june  at june   our allowance for loan losses represented of total gross loans and of nonperforming loans  compared to of total gross loans and of nonperforming loans at june  the allowance for loan losses increased  or  from june  to june  between june  and june   the factors that we applied to various loan categories to determine the amount of the allowance were essentially unchanged  other than with respect to subprime consumer loans 
we increased the risk factor with respect to these loans as a result of recent historical loss experience and general economic trends in our market area 
the small change in the allowance reflected offsetting changes in loan concentration and quality that occurred during the period 
specifically  elements of the allowance for loan losses that decreased were those relating to subprime loans  which decreased million  or  and non accruing subprime loans  which decreased  or and subprime loans delinquent to days  which decreased million  or 
elements of the allowance for loan losses that increased were those relating to substandard loans  which increased million  or and non accruing prime loans  which increased  or 
although we believe that we use the best information available to establish the allowance for loan losses  future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary and results of operations could be adversely affected if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the determinations 
furthermore  while we believe we have established our allowance for loan losses in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles  there can be no assurance that regulators  in reviewing our loan portfolio  will not request us to increase our allowance for loan losses 
in addition  because future events affecting borrowers and collateral cannot be predicted with certainty  there can be no assurance that the existing allowance for loan losses is adequate or that increases will not be necessary should the quality of any loans deteriorate as a result of the factors discussed above 
any material increase in the allowance for loan losses may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations

when a loan becomes days delinquent  the loan is placed on nonaccrual status at which time the accrual of interest ceases and the reserve for any uncollectible accrued interest is established and charged against operations 
typically  payments received on a nonaccrual loan are applied to the outstanding principal and interest as determined at the time of collection of the loan 
as a community financial institution  we have strived to serve the credit needs of our local communities  which has included lending to borrowers with marginal credit histories 
consequently  we have experienced a higher level of delinquencies  classified assets and charge offs 
in recent periods  we have taken steps that are intended to help us to continue to serve the credit needs of the community while improving asset quality 
these measures include the use of a credit scoring model that is designed to assist in predicting payment performance for newly originated loans 
we now use beacon credit scores to price loans according to risk  to monitor loan profitability  to monitor the diversification of the loan portfolio  including subprime loans  and to track loans that are charged off 
we believe that these efforts have helped to reduce nonperforming assets 
we consider repossessed assets and loans that are days or more past due to be nonperforming assets 
real estate that we acquire as a result of foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure is classified as real estate owned until it is sold 
when property is acquired it is recorded at the lower of its cost  which is the unpaid balance of the loan plus foreclosure costs  or fair market value at the date of foreclosure 
holding costs and declines in fair value after acquisition of the property result in charges against income 
nonperforming assets totaled million  or of total assets  at june   which is a decrease of million  or  from june  foreclosed real estate decreased  to  at june  at june   foreclosed real estate consisted of single family homes  mobile homes and parcels of real estate 
nonaccrual loans at june  included million of residential mortgage loans   of commercial real estate loans   of commercial business and  of consumer loans 
under current accounting guidelines  a loan is defined as impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due under the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
we consider one to four family mortgage loans and consumer installment loans to be homogeneous and  therefore  do not separately evaluate them for impairment 
all other loans are evaluated for impairment on an individual basis 
at june   we had  of impaired loans  which consisted of three residential mortgage loans

the amount of interest related to these loans included in interest income was  for the year ended june  and  for the year ended june  we use beacon credit scores to predict the likelihood that an existing borrower or potential customer will become a serious credit risk 
beacon credit scores are based on data available in an individual s credit report  such as payment history  outstanding debt and types of credit in use 
beacon scores range from to we consider loans by borrowers with a beacon score of less than to be subprime loans 
there is no single definition of subprime  and other financial institutions may use different criteria to identify their subprime loans 
for example  fannie mae and freddie mac generally designate borrowers with a credit bureau score of or below as subprime

pursuant to federal regulations  we review and classify our assets on a regular basis 
in addition  the office of thrift supervision has the authority to identify problem assets and  if appropriate  require them to be classified 
there are three classifications for problem assets substandard  doubtful and loss 
substandard assets must have one or more defined weaknesses and are characterized by the distinct possibility that we will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected 
doubtful assets have the weaknesses of substandard assets with the additional characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full on the basis of currently existing facts  conditions and values questionable  and there is a high possibility of loss 
an asset classified loss is considered uncollectible and of such little value that continuance as an asset of the institution is not warranted 
the regulations also provide for a special mention category  described as assets which do not currently expose us to a sufficient degree of risk to warrant classification but do possess credit deficiencies or potential weaknesses deserving our close attention 
when we classify an asset as substandard or doubtful we must establish a general allowance for loan losses 
if we classify an asset as loss  we must either establish specific allowances for loan losses in the amount of of the portion of the asset classified loss or charge off such amount 
the following table shows the aggregate amounts of our classified assets at the dates indicated 
at june  in thousands substandard assets doubtful assets loss assets total classified assets at each of the dates in the above table  substandard assets consisted of all nonperforming assets plus other loans that we believed exhibited weakness 
these substandard but performing loans totaled million  million and  at june   and  respectively 
at each date  substandard but performing loans included a commercial real estate loan that at june  had a balance of  at june  we included  of other loans by the same borrower or related persons  for a total of million of substandard but performing loans to one borrower and related persons 
the corporate borrower has been in bankruptcy  but has kept all loans current  with the exception of one commercial loan that is days past due 
at june   we also had million of loans that we were monitoring because of concerns about the borrowers ability to continue to make payments in the future  none of which were nonperforming or classified as substandard 
at that date   of the allowance for loan losses related to those loans

liquidity and capital resources liquidity is the ability to meet current and future financial obligations of a short term nature 
our primary sources of funds consist of deposit inflows  loan repayments  maturities and sales of investment securities and borrowings from the federal home loan bank of cincinnati 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds  deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
we regularly adjust our investments in liquid assets based upon our assessment of expected loan demand  expected deposit flows  yields available on interest earning deposits and securities and the objectives of our asset liability management program 
excess liquid assets are invested generally in interest earning deposits and short and intermediate term us government agency obligations 
our most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents and interest bearing deposits 
the levels of these assets are dependent on our operating  financing  lending and investing activities during any given period 
at june   cash and cash equivalents totaled million and interest bearing deposits totaled million

we are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the office of thrift supervision  including a risk based capital measure 
the risk based capital guidelines include both a definition of capital and a framework for calculating risk weighted assets by assigning balance sheet assets and off balance sheet items to broad risk categories 
at june   we exceeded all of our regulatory capital requirements 
we are considered well capitalized under regulatory guidelines 
see regulation and supervision federal savings institution regulation capital requirements 
the capital from the conversion significantly increased our liquidity and capital resources 
over time  the initial level of liquidity will be reduced as net proceeds from the stock offering are used for general corporate purposes  including the funding of lending activities 
we intend to use share repurchases and cash dividends to help manage our capital levels 
off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of operations  we engage in a variety of financial transactions that  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  are not recorded in our financial statements 
these transactions involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit  interest rate  and liquidity risk 
such transactions are used primarily to manage customers requests for funding and take the form of loan commitments  unused lines of

impact of recent accounting pronouncements in november  the financial accounting standards board issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
interpretation no 
requires a guarantor entity at the inception of a guarantee covered by the measurement provisions of the interpretation  to record a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
in addition  interpretation no 
elaborates on previously existing disclosure requirements for most guarantees  including loan guarantees such a standby letters of credit 
the recognition and measurement provisions of interpretation no 
were effective on a prospective basis after december   and its adoption on january  has not had a significant effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
this statement provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  this statement amends the disclosure requirements of statement no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
we have not completed an analysis of the potential effects of this statement on our financial statements 
in january  the financial accounting standards board issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
interpretation no 
requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or is entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns  or both 
interpretation no 
also requires disclosures about variable interest entities that a company is not required to consolidate  but in which it has a significant variable interest 
on december   the financial accounting standards board revised interpretation no 
and deferred the effective date of interpretation no 
to no later than the end of the first reporting period that ends after march  for special purpose entities  however  interpretation no 
would be required to be applied as of december  we have not established any variable interest entities

effect of inflation and changing prices the financial statements and related financial data presented in this prospectus have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the primary impact of inflation on our operations is reflected in increased operating costs 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than do general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk qualitative aspects of market risk 
our most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk 
we manage the interest rate sensitivity of our interest bearing liabilities and interest earning assets in an effort to minimize the adverse effects of changes in the interest rate environment 
deposit accounts typically react more quickly to changes in market interest rates than mortgage loans because of the shorter maturities of deposits 
as a result  sharp increases in interest rates may adversely affect our earnings while decreases in interest rates may beneficially affect our earnings 
to reduce the potential volatility of our earnings  we have sought to improve the match between asset and liability maturities and rates  while maintaining an acceptable interest rate spread 
pursuant to this strategy  we actively originate adjustable rate mortgage loans for retention in our loan portfolio 
these loans generally reprice beginning after five years and annually thereafter 
most of our residential adjustable rate mortgage loans may not adjust downward below their initial interest rate 
although historically we have been successful in originating adjustable rate mortgage loans  the ability to originate such loans depends to a great extent on market interest rates and borrowers preferences 
as an alternative to adjustable rate mortgage loans  we offer fixed rate mortgage loans with maturities of fifteen years or less 
this product enables us to compete in the fixed rate mortgage market while maintaining a shorter maturity 
fixed rate mortgage loans typically have an adverse effect on interest rate sensitivity compared to adjustable rate loans 
in recent years  we have used investment securities with terms of seven years or less and adjustable rate mortgage backed securities to help manage interest rate risk 
we currently do not participate in hedging programs  interest rate swaps or other activities involving the use of off balance sheet derivative financial instruments 
we have established an asset liability committee to communicate  coordinate and control all aspects involving asset liability management 
the committee establishes and monitors the volume and mix of assets and funding sources with the objective of managing assets and funding sources to produce results that are consistent with liquidity  capital adequacy  growth  risk limits and profitability goals 
quantitative aspects of market risk 
we use an interest rate sensitivity analysis prepared by the office of thrift supervision to review our level of interest rate risk 
this analysis measures interest rate risk by computing changes in net portfolio value of our cash flows from assets  liabilities and off balance sheet items in the event of a range of assumed changes in market interest rates 
net portfolio value represents the market value of portfolio equity and is equal to the market value of assets minus the market value of liabilities  with 
table of contents adjustments made for off balance sheet items 
this analysis assesses the risk of loss in market risk sensitive instruments in the event of a sudden and sustained to basis point increase or basis point decrease in market interest rates with no effect given to any steps that we might take to counter the effect of that interest rate movement 
because of the low level of market interest rates  this analysis is not performed for decreases of more than basis points 
we measure interest rate risk by modeling the changes in net portfolio value over a variety of interest rate scenarios 
the following table  which is based on information that we provide to the office of thrift supervision  presents the change in our net portfolio value at june  that would occur in the event of an immediate change in interest rates based on office of thrift supervision assumptions  with no effect given to any steps that we might take to counteract that change 
net portfolio value dollars in thousands net portfolio value as of portfolio value of assets basis point bp change in rates amount change change npv ratio change bp   bp the office of thrift supervision uses certain assumptions in assessing the interest rate risk of savings associations 
these assumptions relate to interest rates  loan prepayment rates  deposit decay rates  and the market values of certain assets under differing interest rate scenarios  amount others 
as with any method of measuring interest rate risk  certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing table 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as adjustable rate mortgage loans  have features that restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
further  in the event of a change in interest rates  expected rates of prepayments on loans and early withdrawals from certificates could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table
