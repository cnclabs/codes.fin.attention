item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for an understanding of avnet and the significant factors that influenced the company s performance during the past three fiscal years  the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the description of the business appearing in item of this report and the consolidated financial statements  including the related notes  and other information appearing in item of this report 
there are numerous references to the impact of foreign currency translation in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a 
over the past two years  the us dollar has weakened significantly in comparison to most foreign currencies  especially the euro which strengthened against the us dollar by approximately from fiscal to fiscal and by approximately from fiscal to fiscal 
when the weaker us dollar exchange rates of fiscal and are used to translate the results of operations of avnet s subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies  the resulting impact is an increase  in us dollars  of reported results 
in addition to disclosing financial results that are determined in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap  the company also discloses pro forma or non gaap measures that may exclude certain items 
management believes that providing this additional information is useful to the reader to better assess and understand operating performance  especially when comparing results with previous periods or forecasting performance for future periods 
management believes the pro forma measures also help indicate underlying trends in the business 
management also uses pro forma information to establish operational goals and  in some cases  for measuring performance for compensation purposes 
however  analysis of results and outlook on a pro forma or non gaap basis should be used as a complement to  and in conjunction with  data presented in accordance with gaap 
results from operations executive summary fiscal was the year operating efficiencies  which avnet has derived from its value based management initiatives and focus on operating costs over the past several years  combined with sales growth to drive a dramatic increase in the company s profitability 
the company s sales growth of from fiscal to fiscal resulted from increased sales in each of the company s operating groups avnet electronics marketing  or em  and avnet technology solutions  or ts as well as across all three regions in which avnet does business americas  europe  the middle east and africa  hereafter referred to as emea  and asia 
approximately one third of this year over year sales growth is a result of the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
during fiscal  the electronic component and computer product industry emerged from the economic and industry downturn that commenced after the company s second quarter of fiscal while the downturn caused rapid sales declines in the second half of fiscal and in fiscal  the company s top line performance largely stabilized from that point forward until the beginning of fiscal in what remained a relatively weak technology industry and economy as a whole 
during the down cycle  avnet s focus on managing its operating costs resulted in the company eliminating significant expense from its ongoing operations 
as a result  selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were in fiscal as compared with as recently as fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of gross profit showed a more significant positive trend by dropping to in fiscal as compared with in fiscal the operating expense reductions resulted primarily from the company s ongoing cost reduction initiatives and recent restructuring efforts further discussed in this md a 
the company similarly managed its working capital during this period with steady improvement in inventory turns  days sales outstanding and payable days 
this focus on managing working capital allowed the company to maximize its operating cash flow despite the downturn and to reduce its outstanding debt and related interest expense substantially since fiscal within avnet s operating groups  em generated increases in sales in fiscal of over fiscal em  which markets and sells semiconductors as well as interconnect  passive and electromechanical devices and radio frequency microwave components  is the more cyclical of the company s two operating groups 
therefore  the previous down cycle  as well as the industry upturn that commenced in fiscal  had a more 
table of contents significant impact on em s results of operations than on those of avnet s computer products operating group  ts  where revenues increased by from fiscal to fiscal em s revenues grew in fiscal in all three regions  with the asia pacific region leading the way with a million increase in annual sales  representing nearly growth year over year 
this growth in the asia pacific region  especially in the electronic component industry  is indicative of the ongoing trend for the past several years where this region has continued to represent one of the company s most significant growth opportunities 
management believes avnet is well positioned to capitalize on this growth based on its already established position in the asia region  and specifically in the peoples republic of china 
as a result of this trend  the asia pacific region now accounts for of em s global sales as compared with in fiscal the fiscal growth in ts s sales was driven primarily by growth in the americas region on strength of sales primarily in storage  software and networking products and services 
as a result of the more rapid growth in em as compared with ts  em s sales constituted of avnet s consolidated sales  up from in fiscal and in fiscal independent of future growth rates  operating efficiency and working capital management will remain a key focus of avnet s overall value based management initiatives and its efforts to continue growing profitability and return on capital at a faster rate than growth in revenues 
as a distributor  it is difficult to forecast the material trends of the electronic component and computer product industry  aside from some of the normal seasonality discussed herein  because avnet does not typically have material forward looking information available from its customers and suppliers beyond approximately three to four months of forecast information 
as such  management relies on the publicly available information published by certain industry groups and other related analyses in evaluating its business prospects in the longer term 
sales the tables below provide a year over year summary of sales for the company and its operating groups three year analysis of sales by operating group and geography years ended percent change july  of june  of june  of to to total total total dollars in millions sales by operating group em ts sales by geographic area americas emea asia pacific consolidated sales for fiscal of billion increased by billion  or  over fiscal sales of billion 
avnet finished fiscal with its strongest annual sales results since fiscal as discussed above  this significant sales growth is largely a result of an electronic component and computer product industry that has emerged from the roughly three year industry and economic downturn that commenced midway through the company s fiscal changes in foreign currency exchange rates from fiscal to also contributed to this growth in sales year over year by roughly million 
as the table above shows  the consolidated sales growth was composed of year over year increases in sales in both of the company s operating groups as well as across all three global regions in which avnet does business 
em s sales of billion in fiscal were up million  or  over em s fiscal sales of billion 
the asia pacific region was the largest driver of em s growth with fiscal sales of billion  up million  or  from sales of million in fiscal  and representing the sixth 
table of contents consecutive year of record sales for this region of em s operations 
this growth in the asia pacific region is indicative of an ongoing trend whereby technology manufacturing continues to shift to this region  especially in the component industry in which em competes  as well as the growth of the indigenous markets 
avnet continues to invest in this region  in the form of it initiatives and logistics and service centers  to take advantage of the ongoing growth opportunities of this rapidly expanding technology marketplace 
em also generated sales growth in the other two regions of the world with em emea s fiscal sales of billion growing over fiscal sales of billion and em americas fiscal sales of billion growing over fiscal sales of billion 
in addition to the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  the increased sales in fiscal in all regions is a result of increasing customer demand coupled with steady improvements in technology related capital spending 
these higher demand and spending levels were prevalent throughout the majority of fiscal with an expected minor summer flattening of demand levels in the americas and emea regions in the final month of fiscal as well as a leveling off in asia primarily as a result of the abnormally high incoming business levels in this region throughout the fiscal year up until the end of the fourth quarter 
em s foreign results were positively impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates  which yielded roughly million of em s year over year consolidated sales growth 
ts s sales of billion in fiscal were up million  or  over ts s fiscal sales of billion 
the americas region has traditionally accounted for greater than of ts s global sales as was the case again in fiscal as a result  growth in the americas region drove much of ts s growth overall with sales of billion  up over ts americas fiscal sales of billion 
the growth in ts s americas business was driven primarily by strength of sales in storage  software and networking products and services 
ts emea s fiscal sales of billion were down from fiscal sales of billion 
however  ts emea s sales results in fiscal were positively impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates by an estimated million 
the decline in sales on a constant dollar basis in ts emea is primarily a function of ts s strategic decision in the second half of fiscal to exit certain low profit  low return on capital employed business 
the customer engagements exited accounted for estimated annualized sales in excess of million in fiscal ts asia s fiscal sales of million were up million  or  from fiscal sales of million 
a combination of the regional and operating group factors discussed above resulted in em constituting a larger percentage of avnet s consolidated sales in fiscal   as compared with fiscal and at and  respectively 
this larger contribution from the em operating group is also typical for an up cycle in the electronic component and computer product industry 
on a consolidated basis  the dispersion of the company s sales on a regional basis also continued to shift toward the asia pacific region with this region now constituting a record of avnet s consolidated sales  as compared with less than as recently as fiscal the emea region s contribution to consolidated sales has remained relatively stable over the past three fiscal years  in the range  while the americas region has declined from nearly in fiscal to less than in fiscal the company closed fiscal with sales of billion  up million  or  as compared with fiscal consolidated sales of billion 
the strengthening of the euro as compared with the us dollar drove much of this slight increase in consolidated sales between fiscal and the relatively flat sales performance on a constant dollar basis between these two years was indicative of an electronic component and computer product industry that had stabilized but remained relatively weak following the precipitous decline of the industry and the economic downturn that began midway through fiscal em s sales of billion in fiscal were up million  or  over fiscal sales of billion  driven by the strength in the euro and growth in the asia pacific region 
ts s sales of billion in fiscal were down slightly by million  or  from fiscal sales of billion driven primarily by growth in fiscal in the enterprise computing and storage markets  offset by reduced activity in telecommunications and networking sectors and the early impacts of the strategic decision to exit low profit  low return on capital employed business in fiscal as discussed above 
gross profit and gross profit margins consolidated gross profit for fiscal was billion  representing a gross profit margin of  as compared with billion  and a comparable gross profit margin of in fiscal the mix of business 
table of contents between the company s two operating groups as well as the mix of product sales within the operating groups impacts the gross profit margins of the company 
specifically  computer product sales from ts typically yield lower gross profit margins than the component sales of em 
in addition  the continuing growth of business in em asia impacts consolidated gross profit margins as the business model in this region typically yields a lower gross profit margin although the operating cost structure of em asia is also lower than the other regions in which the company operates 
therefore  when em constitutes a larger percentage of consolidated sales  gross profit margins will also typically increase 
the impact on gross profit margins of em s increased share of avnet s consolidated sales for the whole of fiscal was not significant primarily due to the mix between the operating groups over the course of fiscal the dramatic growth in em s business did not fully emerge until the second half of fiscal as a result  the company s consolidated gross profit margin improved by basis points in the second half of fiscal when compared with the first half of fiscal consolidated gross profit margins of in the fourth quarter of fiscal reached their highest level in two years 
the company also measures productivity by monitoring its gross profit per average employee and  due in large part to the restructuring efforts in recent years as further discussed in restructuring and other charges  the company s gross profit per average employee in fiscal was approximately  as compared with approximately  in fiscal  an increase of 
consolidated gross profit margins were in fiscal  down from in fiscal additionally  gross profit in fiscal included million of restructuring charges discussed below which reduced the reported gross profit margin in fiscal by basis points 
this year over year decline was attributable to a larger portion of the company s consolidated sales originating from the lower margin computer products operating group  in addition to mix of product sales within the groups  specifically in ts where there was a higher volume of software sales in fiscal  which yield a lower gross profit margin and have a lower capital requirement than most other computer products 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses were billion  or of sales  in fiscal as compared with billion  or of sales in fiscal in addition to percentage of sales  another important metric that management utilizes to monitor its operating expenses is selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of gross profit 
this ratio improved to in fiscal as compared with in fiscal this substantial improvement in these key measures of operating leverage resulted from the significant cost reduction efforts that the company put in place in recent years to manage its overall profitability during the industry downturn and through the up cycle that has now begun these efforts are further discussed in restructuring and other charges below 
the fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses were also negatively impacted by foreign exchange rate differences year over year which yielded an estimated increase in fiscal costs of roughly million of sales and of gross profit 
furthermore  the company did not realize the majority of the benefit from the restructuring activities of the first and second quarters of fiscal until the second half of fiscal as a result of this timing  selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales and as a percentage of gross profit fell to and  respectively  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  representing the company s best performance in these metrics since fiscal when the downturn began 
the operating leverage ratios discussed above  in addition to return on working capital and return on capital employed  continue to be key metrics that management monitors in its efforts to achieve appropriate levels of profitability 
selling  general and administrative expenses of billion in fiscal were of sales as compared with billion  or of sales  in fiscal the improvement in fiscal was a function of the company s cost reduction efforts in that year and in the previous year to remove expenses from the business in the face of the revenue declines that occurred during the industry and economic downturn 
the impacts of these efforts were partially offset by the strengthening of the euro against the us dollar in fiscal as compared with fiscal restructuring and other charges the company recorded a number of restructuring and other charges during the last three fiscal years 
these charges relate primarily to three items the reorganization of the company s operations in each of 
table of contents the three major regions of the world in which the company operates  generally taken in response to business conditions at the time of the charge  charges in fiscal stemming from acquisition and integration of kent electronics corporation kent  which was accounted for using the pooling of interests method of accounting  and charges to record impairment in the company s internet related investments 
see note to the consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this report for a detail of activity within the restructuring and other charge accounts during the past three years 
fiscal during the first and second quarters of fiscal  the company executed certain restructuring and cost reduction initiatives designed to continue improving the profitability of the company 
these actions can generally be broken into three categories the combination of cm and ac as discussed in item of this report and in note to the consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this report  the reorganization of the company s global it resources  which had previously been administered generally on a separate basis within each of the company s operating groups  and various other reductions within em and certain centralized support functions 
restructuring and other charges incurred during the first quarter of fiscal totaled million pre tax and million after tax  or per diluted share 
the pre tax charge consisted of severance costs million  charges related to consolidation of selected facilities million  write downs of certain capitalized it related initiatives million and other items  consisting primarily of the write off of the remaining unamortized deferred loan costs associated with the company s multi year credit facility terminated in september as discussed in liquidity and capital resources financing transactions million 
severance costs resulted from workforce reductions of approximately personnel completed during the first quarter  primarily in executive  support and other non customer facing functions in the americas and emea regions 
management also identified a number of facilities for consolidation primarily in the americas and emea regions 
these facilities generally related to certain logistics and warehousing operations as well as certain administrative facilities across both operating groups and at the corporate level 
the charges related to reserves for remaining non cancelable lease obligations and write downs to fair market value of owned assets located in these facilities that have been vacated 
management also evaluated and elected to discontinue a number of it related initiatives that  in light of recent business restructurings  no longer met the company s return on investment standards for continued use or deployment 
these charges related to write offs of capitalized hardware and software 
restructuring charges incurred during the second quarter of fiscal totaled million pre tax  million after tax  or per diluted share 
the charges consisted of severance costs million  charges related to write downs of owned assets and consolidation of selected facilities million  write downs of certain capitalized it related initiatives million and other items million 
severance charges related to workforce reductions of approximately personnel  the majority of whom staffed warehousing  administrative and support functions primarily for facilities within ts emea operations that were identified for consolidation as part of the combination of cm and ac 
a smaller portion of these charges also impacted operations in the americas 
the combination of cm and ac in emea also led to charges related to reserves for remaining non cancelable lease obligations and write downs to fair market value of owned assets located in the facilities that were vacated 
the facilities primarily served in warehousing and administrative capacities 
management also evaluated and elected to discontinue a number of it related initiatives similar to the decisions also reached in the first quarter of fiscal as discussed above 
these charges related to the write off of capitalized hardware and software 
lastly  the company s efforts to combine cm and ac in emea resulted in the decision to merge the former cm emea operations onto the computer systems that have historically been used in the ac emea business 
the change in the use of this significant asset of cm emea generated a need to analyze the group of long lived assets within the former cm emea operations for impairment 
as a result of this analysis  the company recorded an impairment charge to write down certain long lived assets to their estimated fair market values 
this charge  totaling million  of which million relates to the cm emea computer systems  is included in the facilities and it related charges discussed above 

table of contents during the fourth quarter of fiscal  as part of management s ongoing analysis of the reserves for various restructuring activities  the company recorded adjustments to certain of its remaining reserves 
the adjustments occurred primarily in the company s em and ts operations in emea and related to adjustments to reduce excess severance reserves based upon revised estimates of statutorily required payouts and recording of additional charges related to leased facilities due to modifications to sublease and termination assumptions based upon ongoing market conditions 
the company also negotiated a favorable buyout of a hardware and software maintenance contract  which resulted in the reversal of certain it related reserves 
the net amount of these adjustments was less than million 
the combined charges recorded during fiscal totaled million pre tax and million after tax  or per diluted share 
fiscal during the second quarter of fiscal  the company executed certain actions as part of its cost reduction initiatives and  accordingly  recorded charges totaling million pre tax  million after tax  or per diluted share 
the charge consisted of severance costs million pre tax  charges related to the consolidation of selected facilities million pre tax and charges related to certain it related initiatives million pre tax 
these charges included severance costs and charges related to the consolidation of selected facilities  taken in response to the business environment 
during the second quarter of fiscal  management identified a number of facilities in each of the company s operating groups and its corporate functions  which covered each of the company s geographic regions  to be consolidated into other facilities 
the facilities were identified in an effort to combine certain logistics and administrative operations wherever possible and eliminate what would otherwise be duplicative costs 
the charges related to reserves for remaining non cancelable lease obligations  write downs of the carrying value of certain owned facilities to market value and write downs to fair market value of owned assets located in these leased and owned facilities that were vacated 
additionally  workforce reductions at these and other facilities worldwide resulted in the termination of approximately personnel 
the impacted personnel were primarily in non customer facing positions 
the it related charges resulted from management s decision during the second quarter of fiscal to discontinue a number of it related initiatives that represented insufficient benefit to the company if they were kept in service or continued to be developed 
these charges included the write off of capitalized hardware  software and software licenses 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company executed certain additional actions that resulted in charges totaling million pre tax 
the incremental impact of these actions was substantially offset by certain adjustments that the company recorded  also in the fourth quarter of fiscal  primarily relating to certain of the reserves recorded from the restructuring activity in the second quarter of fiscal the new charge activity  mostly for severance and consolidation of selected facilities  related to each of the company s three operating groups and its corporate functions in the americas and emea regions 
the additional census reductions totaled approximately and resulted primarily from em s decision to combine its cilicon and rf and microwave sales divisions  and ts s decision to reduce its participation in certain market segments where profitability of the products in question have not yielded acceptable economic returns to the company 
the fourth quarter adjustments to prior restructuring and other charges reflect changes in estimates from the time the charges and applicable reserves were initially recorded  relating to reserves for severance and for leases and other contractual commitments that were determined to be excessive during the fourth quarter based upon payments made or still to be made and or based upon more favorable than anticipated sublease or lease buyout arrangements  and an adjustment  based upon estimated sales price net of costs to sell as derived from current market studies and comparable sales  of a portion of a write down that was recorded in the second quarter of fiscal related to an owned facility that was vacated and classified as held for sale during that quarter 
fiscal in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company recorded charges representing a write down in value of certain assets acquired in the fiscal acquisition of kent and certain other charges taken in response to 
table of contents business conditions 
the charge totaled million pre tax million included in cost of sales and the remaining million included as a component of operating expenses and million after tax  or per share on a diluted basis 
the kent related items resulted from the acquisition of kent being accounted for using the pooling of interests method of accounting for the acquisition 
these items related specifically to assets or obligations that were on the books of kent at the acquisition and  therefore  under the pooling of interests method  these items that normally would have been reflected as adjustments to goodwill if the purchase method of accounting had been used were instead recorded to the company s consolidated statement of operations 
these items amounted to million pre tax and relate primarily to write downs to the value of receivables considered uncollectible after the company had exhausted efforts of collecting these amounts from kent s pre acquisition customers million pre tax  excess and obsolete inventory  primarily for customer specific inventory held by kent at the acquisition date that was subsequently determined  through ongoing negotiations with the customer  to require a write down to net realizable value million pre tax  and charges to record additional write downs to approximate fair market value on held for sale properties acquired in the kent acquisition or to record lease reserves for non cancelable lease obligations on properties the company committed to exit million pre tax  net of approximately million pre tax in cash recoveries of certain charges recorded as part of the restructuring and integration charges taken in the fourth quarter of the remaining pre tax charge recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal  which amounted to million  included an impairment charge of million pre tax to write down certain of the company s investments in unconsolidated internet related businesses to their fair market value and million pre tax for severance charges taken for workforce reductions  primarily in the americas region  with more limited reductions in emea and asia  totaling approximately individuals 
the impairments recorded to the company s internet related investments are considered capital losses for tax purposes and were therefore only deductible to the extent the company had available capital gains 
at that time  there were no capital gains  available or forecasted in the foreseeable future  to offset these losses 
therefore  the company generally did not record a tax benefit for these losses 
status of restructuring reserves as of july   the company s total remaining reserves for restructuring and other related activities totaled million 
of this balance  million relates to remaining severance reserves  the majority of which the company expects to utilize by the end of the first quarter of fiscal reserves for million relate to reserves for contractual lease commitments  substantially all of which the company expects to utilize by the end of fiscal the it related and other reserves  which total million  relate primarily to remaining contractual commitments  the majority of which the company expects to utilize by the end of fiscal operating income loss operating income for fiscal was million  or of consolidated sales as compared with operating income of million  or of consolidated sales in fiscal results for both of these periods include the negative impacts of restructuring and other charges  further discussed above  which totaled million  or of sales  in fiscal and million  or of sales in fiscal this significant improvement in operating income in absolute dollars and as a percentage of sales is driven by the growth in sales and the reduction in selling  general and administrative expenses  all of which are discussed previously in this md a 
em reported operating income of million  or of em s sales  in fiscal  which is more than double em s operating income in fiscal of million  or of em s sales 
ts s fiscal operating income of million  or of ts s sales  also improved from million  or of ts s sales  in fiscal these operating income results within avnet s operating groups are  similar to the consolidated results  primarily a function of the company s ongoing cost reduction efforts across both operating groups and all regions  in addition to the growth in sales year over year 

table of contents the company s fiscal consolidated operating income of million was up from a loss of million in fiscal  both periods including the negative impacts of restructuring and other charges discussed above million in fiscal and million in fiscal 
the improvement in operating income in fiscal is the result of the early impacts of the company s efforts to remove ongoing costs from the business through its restructuring efforts since the end of fiscal interest expense and other income expense interest expense was million in fiscal  down as compared with million in fiscal the decrease in interest expense between periods is a function of two factors 
first  the company has reduced its total debt outstanding 
the company s average balance of debt and drawings under its accounts receivable securitization program during fiscal was billion as compared with billion in fiscal the second factor in this decrease in expense relates to the change in the company s effective interest rates due to the composition of the company s debt balances 
the company fully repaid its original principal balances of million of notes due august  and million of notes due october  through tender and early redemption of these notes during fiscal and the repayment of the remaining principal and interest upon maturity in the first half of fiscal see liquidity and capital resources financing transactions for further discussion of this transaction and other debt activity discussed below 
although the company added million of notes due february  in the third quarter of fiscal  the company also entered into hedge contracts for million of these notes which effectively converts these notes from a fixed rate of to a variable rate at july  based upon us libor plus a spread 
the company also benefited significantly in the fourth quarter of fiscal from the offering of the million convertible debentures due march  and the tender for a portion of the outstanding notes due february   both of which closed before the end of the third quarter of fiscal interest expense was million in fiscal as compared with million in fiscal  representing a decline year over year 
this decrease is due primarily to the ongoing debt reductions and reduced drawings under the accounts receivable securitization program see liquidity and capital resources off balance sheet arrangements for further discussion during fiscal consolidated debt balances at june  were billion as compared with billion at june  additionally  the company had million of outstanding drawings under the accounts receivable securitization program at june  other income  net  which includes interest income  was million in fiscal as compared with million in fiscal and million in fiscal the primary variable impacting other income  net  is the effect of foreign currency gains or losses  which resulted in a gain in fiscal as compared with the results for fiscal and debt extinguishment costs as discussed further under liquidity and capital resources financing transactions  the company incurred debt extinguishment costs in both fiscal and fiscal associated with the tender and early redemption of a portion of its outstanding publicly traded debt 
in completing these transactions the company incurred debt extinguishment costs  related primarily to premiums and other transaction costs associated with these tenders and early redemptions  which totaled million pre tax  million after tax  or per share on a diluted basis in fiscal and million pre tax  million after tax  or per share on a diluted basis in fiscal income tax provision benefit the company s effective tax rate in fiscal was as compared with in fiscal the mix of avnet s profits amongst its various international subsidiaries with varying statutory tax rates impacts the company s effective tax rates 
the continuing improvement in profitability  particularly in the emea and asia pacific regions  has led to an effective tax rate substantially lower than the us federal tax rate 
similarly  the mix of profits amongst international subsidiaries in fiscal yielded an effective tax rate on the company s pre tax loss that was more favorable than the us federal tax rate 

table of contents the otherwise favorable rate impacts from the mix of international profits in fiscal were offset by the impact of the company s charges to impair its investment in certain unconsolidated internet related businesses  which charges were not deductible for tax purposes see restructuring and other charges for further discussion 
as a result  the effective tax rate in fiscal was as compared with in fiscal net income loss as a result of the factors described in the preceding sections of this md a  the company s net income was million  or per share on a diluted basis  in fiscal as compared with a net loss of million  or per share on a diluted basis  in fiscal and a net loss before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of million  or per share on a diluted basis  in fiscal these results include the negative after tax impact of restructuring and other charges and debt extinguishment costs of million  or per share on a diluted basis  in fiscal  million  or per share on a diluted basis  in fiscal and million  or per share on a diluted basis  in fiscal change in accounting principle goodwill the company adopted the financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  which establishes financial accounting and reporting for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets 
the company s mechanism for adoption of sfas no 
is further discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this report 
as a result of transition impairment provisions of sfas  the company recorded an impairment charge of million  or per share on a diluted basis  in fiscal  which was recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first quarter of fiscal the magnitude of the transition impairment charge was significantly impacted by the timing of the effective date of when the fair value analysis was performed and the designation of the reporting unit structure 
since the company adopted sfas on june   the fair value analysis was required to be completed as of that date 
due to the difficult business and economic conditions at that date  which severely impacted the market sectors in which the company operates  and the uncertainty as to when such conditions would materially improve  the fair value of the company s businesses was significantly less than it might have been at other times 
in other words  in a cyclical business  the timing of a valuation such as this may be an important factor in the outcome of the valuation exercise 
the reporting units with the most significant impairment of goodwill are in europe where the company had not yet generated an acceptable level of profits and cash flows 
in addition  the defined reporting unit structure resulted in an impairment of goodwill which includes goodwill related to certain recent acquisitions that otherwise might not have been impaired 
the company conducts its periodic test for goodwill impairment annually  on the first day of the fiscal fourth quarter 
the company s annual impairment tests in fiscal  and have yielded no additional impairments to the carrying value of the company s goodwill 
critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
these estimates and assumptions are based upon the company s continuous evaluation of historical results and anticipated future events 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the securities and exchange commission defines critical accounting polices as those that are  in management s view  most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of 
table of contents operations and that require significant judgments and estimates 
management believes the company s most critical accounting policies relate to valuation of receivables the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from customer defaults 
bad debt reserves are recorded based upon historic default averages as well as the company s regular assessment of the financial condition of its customers 
therefore  if collection experience or the financial condition of specific customers were to deteriorate  management would evaluate whether additional allowances and corresponding charge to the consolidated statement of operations are required 
valuation of inventories inventories are recorded at the lower of cost first in first out or estimated market value 
the company s inventories include high technology components  embedded systems and computing technologies sold into rapidly changing  cyclical and competitive markets whereby such inventories may be subject to early technological obsolescence 
the company regularly evaluates inventories for excess  obsolescence or other factors that may render inventories less marketable 
write downs are recorded so that inventories reflect the approximate net realizable value and take into account the company s contractual provisions with its suppliers  which provide certain protections to the company for product obsolescence and price erosion in the form of rights of return and price protection 
because of the large number of transactions and the complexity of managing the process around price protections and stock rotations  estimates are made regarding adjustments to the carrying amount of inventories 
additionally  assumptions about future demand  market conditions and decisions to discontinue certain product lines can impact the decision to write down inventories 
if assumptions about future demand change or actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  management would evaluate whether additional write downs of inventories are required 
in any case  actual values could be different from those estimated 
accounting for income taxes management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and the valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
the carrying value of the company s net foreign operating loss carry forwards is dependent upon its ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions 
in addition  the company considers historic levels of income  expectations and risk associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing a tax valuation allowance 
should the company determine that it is not able to realize all or part of its deferred tax assets in the future  an additional valuation allowance may be recorded against the deferred tax assets with a corresponding charge to income in the period such determination is made 
restructuring and integration charges the company has been subject to the financial impact of integrating acquired businesses and charges related to business reorganizations 
in connection with such events  management is required to make estimates about the financial impact of such matters that are inherently uncertain 
accrued liabilities and reserves are established to cover the cost of severance  facility consolidation and closure  lease termination fees  inventory adjustments based upon acquisition related termination of supplier agreements and or the re evaluation of the acquired working capital assets inventory and accounts receivable  and write down of other acquired assets including goodwill 
actual amounts incurred could be different from those estimated 
additionally  in assessing the company s goodwill for impairment in accordance with sfas  the company is required to make significant assumptions about the future cash flows and overall performance of its reporting units 
should these assumptions or the structure of the reporting units change in the future based upon market conditions or changes in business strategy  the company may be required to record additional impairment charges to its remaining goodwill 
see change in accounting principle goodwill in this md a for further discussion of sfas and the company s evaluation of its goodwill for any potential impairment 
contingencies and litigation the company is involved in various legal proceedings and other claims related to environmental  labor  product and other matters  all of which arise in the normal course of business 
the company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgment or outcome to these matters  as well as the range of potential losses 
a determination of the reserves required  if any  is made after careful analysis by management and internal and  when necessary  external counsel 
the required reserves may change in the 
table of contents future due to developments or a change in circumstances 
changes to reserves could increase or decrease earnings in the period the changes are effective 
the company does not consider revenue recognition to be a critical accounting policy due to the nature of its business in which revenues are generally recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured

table of contents liquidity and capital resources cash flows the following table summarizes the company s cash flow activities for fiscal  and  including the company s computation of free cash flow 
management believes that the non gaap metric of free cash flow is a useful measure to help management and investors better assess and understand the company s operating performance and sources and uses of cash 
management also believes analysis of free cash flow assists in identifying underlying trends in the business 
years ended july  june  june  millions net income excluding non cash and other reconciling items and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle cash flow generated from used for working capital excluding cash and cash equivalents net cash flow from operations cash flow generated from used for purchases of property  plant and equipment cash proceeds from sales of property  plant and equipment acquisition of operations and investments effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents cash dividends other  net financing activities net free cash flow reduced drawings under accounts receivable securitization program repayment of debt  net net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents during fiscal  the company generated million of cash and cash equivalents from its operating activities 
this is made up of the cash flow generated from net income excluding non cash and other reconciling items  which includes the add back of depreciation and amortization  deferred taxes  non cash restructuring and other charges see results of operations restructuring and other charges for further discussion and other non cash items primarily the provision for doubtful accounts see note to the consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this report 
the sum of these items yielded cash inflow for the year of million 
partially offsetting this amount are cash flows of million used for the company s working capital needs excluding cash and cash equivalents during fiscal the primary driver of this outflow relate to the growth of receivables million and inventory million  net of cash flow generation from accounts payable million and other working capital items million 
these trends in working capital are typical of an up cycle in the electronic components industry as growth in receivables and payables is driven by higher sales and purchasing volumes 
additionally  inventory growth was also expected as the industry moves into an up cycle  especially in the electronic components sector where longer lead times from suppliers and increased demand from customers typically result in the distributor carrying higher levels of inventory 
as a result  em elected to build inventory in certain products to accommodate the growing levels in demand and in support of customer contractual agreements to purchase certain inventory 
despite this growth in inventory during fiscal  the company s inventory turns for the year remained at their highest point since before the last up cycle ended in fiscal and actually improved by over inventory turns in fiscal within em on a standalone basis  where the majority of the inventory increases took place  fiscal inventory turns improved by over fiscal this improvement in turns is driven by a combination of the increased sales and the selective buildup of inventory primarily in higher volume product lines 
even with some moderate seasonal leveling off of sales in the final 
table of contents month of fiscal  management believes its inventory levels are adequate but not excessive in addressing forecast demand in the upcoming months 
since the industry and economic downturn commenced in fiscal  the company has significantly reduced its capital expenditures as well as its acquisition and investment activity 
however  during fiscal  the company completed a contingent purchase price payment associated with its january acquisition of of the stock of eurotronics bv  which went to market as sei 
the share purchase agreement for this acquisition called for an additional payment of cash or common stock of the company if the company s share price did not reach per share by january as a result  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company paid  in cash  the sum of million as settlement of the company s final obligation under this acquisition 
this coupled with other  less significant contingent purchase price payments and the acquisition of a minority interest in one of the company s foreign subsidiaries resulted in total cash outflow for acquisitions and investments of million during fiscal these outflows for investing activities  offset in part by the favorable impact of foreign currency on cash and cash equivalents and other financing activities  yielded a net free cash flow of million 
this net free cash flow  coupled with the cash usage for the company s retirement  both early and at maturity  of certain of the company s debt net of proceeds from new debt issued during fiscal see financing transactions  resulted in a net decrease in cash during fiscal of million 
in fiscal  cash flow of million was generated from net income loss excluding non cash and other reconciling items and million was generated by reductions in working capital excluding cash and cash equivalents  thus generating net cash flow from operations of million 
the positive cash flow generated from working capital reductions resulted from the company s continued efforts to improve its asset utilization and efficiency  primarily through reductions of receivables cash inflow of million and inventories cash inflow of million  in what continued to be a stable but weak electronic components and computer products distribution industry during fiscal in addition to cash flow from operating activities in fiscal  million was needed for other business operations including purchases of property  plant and equipment  net of cash proceeds from sales of property  plant and equipment  and cash generated from other items  including the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on the company s cash and cash equivalents 
the company also used million for acquisitions of operations and investments primarily contingent purchase price payments during fiscal  to yield net free cash flow in fiscal of million 
a total of million of this free cash flow was used to reduce the company s borrowings under its accounts receivable securitization program in addition to the retirement of certain of the company s long term debt  net of proceeds from new debt issued during fiscal  with the remaining million generating additional cash and cash equivalents during fiscal in fiscal  cash flow from operating activities totaled million 
during this period  million was generated from net income loss excluding non cash and other reconciling items and the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
an additional million was generated by reductions in working capital excluding cash and cash equivalents 
the cash flow impact of working capital was more significant in fiscal than in the years thereafter as this year represented the first full fiscal year of the economic downturn and  thus  a period when more significant balance sheet management initiatives were put in place 
in addition  the company used million for other business operations including dividend payments  purchases of property plant and equipment  offset in part by cash proceeds on sale of property plant and equipment and net cash generated from other items 
the company also used million for acquisitions of operations and investments during the resulting net free cash flow of million along with million of cash proceeds from long term debt financing were used to reduce drawings under the accounts receivable securitization program by million and to  net  repay debt balances of billion 
finally  cash and cash equivalents increased by million for the year

these financing arrangements include public bonds  short term and long term bank loans  commercial paper and an accounts

in july  the company entered into three additional interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of million in order to hedge the change in fair value of the notes related to fluctuations in interest rates 
these hedges are also classified as fair value hedges and mature in february these interest rate swaps modify the company s interest exposure by effectively converting the fixed rate on the notes to a floating rate at july  based on three month us libor plus a spread through their maturities 
the hedged fixed rate debt and the interest rate swaps are adjusted to current market values through interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
the fair value of the interest rate swaps at july  and june  was million and million  respectively  and is included in other long term assets in the consolidated balance sheet 
additionally  included in long term debt is a comparable fair value adjustment increasing the total liability by these same amounts 
in addition to its primary financing arrangements  the company has several small lines of credit in various locations to fund the short term working capital  foreign exchange  overdraft and letter of credit needs of its wholly owned subsidiaries in europe and asia 
avnet generally guarantees its subsidiaries debt under these facilities 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has a million accounts receivable securitization program the program with two financial institutions whereby it may sell  on a revolving basis  an undivided interest in a pool of its trade accounts receivable 
under the program  the company may sell receivables in securitization transactions and retain a subordinated interest and servicing rights to those receivables 
receivables sold under the program are sold without legal recourse to third party conduits through a wholly owned bankruptcy remote special purpose entity that is consolidated for financial reporting purposes 
the program qualifies for sale treatment under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities 
the availability for financing under the program is dependent on the level of the company s trade receivables from month to month 
there were no receivables sold under the program at july  or at june  the purpose of the program is to provide the company with an additional source of liquidity at interest rates more favorable than it could receive through other forms of financing 
the term of the current program agreement extends to august covenants and conditions the program agreement discussed above requires the company to maintain minimum senior unsecured credit ratings in order to continue utilizing the program in its current form 
these minimum ratings triggers are ba by moody s investor services moody s or bb by standard poors s p 
the program also contains certain covenants relating to the quality of the receivables sold under the program 
if these conditions are not met  the company may not be able to borrow any additional funds under the program and the financial institutions may consider this an amortization event  as defined in the program agreement  which would permit the financial institutions to liquidate the accounts receivable sold under the program to cover any outstanding 
table of contents borrowings 
circumstances that could affect the company s ability to meet the required covenants and conditions of the program include the company s ongoing profitability and perceived financial strength or weakness by credit rating agencies and various other economic  market and industry factors 
the company was in compliance with all covenants of the program at july  the credit facility discussed in financing transactions contains certain covenants with various limitations on debt incurrence  dividends  investments and capital expenditures and also includes financial covenants requiring the company to maintain minimum interest coverage and leverage ratios  as defined 
management does not believe that the covenants in the credit facility limit the company s ability to pursue its intended business strategy or future financing needs 
the company was in compliance with all covenants of the credit facility as of july  see liquidity for further discussion of the company s availability under these various facilities 
liquidity the company had total borrowing capacity of million at july  under the credit facility and the program  against which million in letters of credit were issued under the credit facility as of july   resulting in million of net availability 
the company also had an additional million of cash and cash equivalents at july  there are no significant financial commitments of the company outside of normal debt and lease maturities as disclosed in long term contractual obligations below 
management believes that avnet s borrowing capacity  its current cash availability and the company s expected ability to generate operating cash flows are sufficient to meet its projected financing needs 
if the current up cycle in the electronic components and computer products industry continues  the company is less likely to generate positive cash flows from working capital reductions 
however  any additional cash requirements are expected to be offset by the operating cash flows generated by the company s enhanced profitability model resulting from the significant cost reductions achieved by the company in recent years 
furthermore  the next significant public debt maturity is not until the million notes mature in november  which provides over two years for the company to review repayment or refinancing alternatives 
the following table highlights the company s liquidity and related ratios for the past two years comparative analysis liquidity dollars in millions years ended percentage july  june  change current assets quick assets current liabilities working capital total debt total capital total debt plus total shareholders equity quick ratio working capital ratio debt to total capital ratios that include cash and cash equivalents include million of restricted cash held in escrow at june  to fund remaining principal and interest payments on the and notes see financing transactions for further discussion 
the company s quick assets consisting of cash and cash equivalents and receivables at july  have increased primarily due to the increase in receivables as a function of the growth in sales volumes during fiscal net of a lesser decrease in cash and cash equivalents used to fund the growth of the business and for the pay down of certain of the company s debt balances see cash flow and financing transactions for 
table of contents further discussion 
the increase in inventories during fiscal  as discussed in cash flow  has resulted in additional growth in current assets 
additionally  the increased volume of purchases to accommodate the growth in volume of business has resulted in similar growth in accounts payable and  thus  in total current liabilities 
as a result of these trends  quick assets were greater than the company s current liabilities by million at july  as compared with million at june  working capital grew  however  to billion at july  as compared with billion at the end of the previous year 
at july   to support each dollar of current liabilities  the company had of quick assets and of other current assets for a total of as compared with at june  long term contractual obligations the company has the following contractual obligations outstanding as of july  in millions due in less due in due in due after total than year years years years long term debt  including amounts due within one year operating leases at july   the company has five interest rate swaps outstanding on two of its fixed rate debt instruments which have yielded a fair value adjustment of million to the company s long term debt included in the consolidated balance sheet at july  the company does not currently have any material commitments for capital expenditures 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company seeks to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility associated with changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates by entering into financial arrangements intended to provide a hedge against a portion of the risks associated with such volatility 
the company continues to have exposure to such risks to the extent they are not hedged 
the company has used interest rate swaps that convert certain fixed rate debt to variable rate debt  effectively hedging the change in fair value of the fixed rate debt resulting from fluctuations in interest rates 
at july   the company had five interest rate swaps outstanding under which the company pays a variable interest rate and receives a fixed interest rate 
the following table sets forth the scheduled maturities and the total fair value generally based on quoted market prices of the company s debt outstanding at july  dollars in millions there total at fair value at after july  july  liabilities fixed rate debt average interest rate floating rate debt average interest rate interest rate swaps fixed to variable average pay rate libor average receive rate many of the company s subsidiaries  on occasion  purchase and sell products in currencies other than their functional currencies 
this subjects the company to the risks associated with the fluctuations of foreign currency exchange rates 
the company reduces this risk by utilizing natural hedging offsetting receivables 
table of contents and payables as well as by creating offsetting positions through the use of derivative financial instruments  primarily forward foreign exchange contracts with maturities of less than sixty days 
the company adjusts all foreign denominated balances and any outstanding foreign exchange contracts to fair market value through the consolidated statements of operations 
therefore  the market risk related to foreign exchange contracts is offset by changes in valuation of the underlying items being hedged 
the asset or liability representing the fair value of foreign exchange contracts is classified in the captions other current assets or accrued expenses and other  as applicable  in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
a hypothetical change in currency exchange rates under the contracts outstanding at july  would result in an increase or decrease of approximately million to the fair value of the forward foreign exchange contracts  which would generally be offset by an opposite effect on the related hedged positions
