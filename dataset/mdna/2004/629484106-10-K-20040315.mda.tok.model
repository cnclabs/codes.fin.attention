since january   the company s participation in the pools has been increased to 
the company has ceased writing any new policies covering aircraft insurance for periods subsequent to march  mmo london wrote a book of ocean marine insurance through its participation in lloyd s syndicate and a book of assumed property and aircraft reinsurance through its participation in lloyd s syndicate since january   mmo london has not provided capacity to any lloyd s syndicate 
the company records premiums written in the year policies are issued and earns such premiums on a monthly pro rata basis over the terms of the respective policies 
the following tables present the company s gross premiums written  net premiums written and net premiums earned for each of the past three years 
gross premiums written by segment year ended december  dollars in thousands ocean marine    inland marine fire    other liability    subtotal    aircraft    mmo london  total    nymagic net premiums written by segment year ended december  dollars in thousands ocean marine    inland marine fire    other liability    subtotal    aircraft    mmo london  total    nymagic net premiums earned by segment year ended december  dollars in thousands ocean marine    inland marine fire   other liability    subtotal    aircraft    mmo london   total    unlike many types of property and casualty insurance  ocean marine  inland marine  aircraft and other liability premium rates are not strictly regulated by governmental authorities 
consequently  the company is able to adjust premium rates quickly in response to competition  varying degrees of risk and other factors 
in addition  the company  by virtue of its underwriting flexibility  is able to emphasize specific lines of business in response to advantageous premium rates and its anticipation of positive underwriting results 
however  the insurance industry is highly competitive and the companies against which the company competes may seek to limit any market premium rate 
the property and casualty industry historically has been highly cyclical 
rates for property and casualty insurance are influenced primarily by factors that are outside of our control  including competition and the amount of available capital and surplus in the industry 
for example  the substantial losses in the insurance industry arising from the events of september  caused rates in the insurance industry to rise 
however  new capital has since flowed into the insurance industry 
to the extent that more capital is available  there may be downward pressure on premium rates as a result of increased supply 
these factors affecting rates for the industry in general impact the rates we are able to charge 
any significant decrease in the rates for property and casualty insurance could reduce our net income 
while rates impact our net income  there is not necessarily a direct correlation between the level of rate increases or decreases and net income because other factors  such as the amount of catastrophe losses and the amount of expenses  also affect net income 
prevailing policy terms and conditions in the property and casualty insurance market are also highly cyclical 
changes in terms and conditions unfavorable to insurers  which tend to be correlated with declining rates  could further reduce our net income 
even as rates rise  the average percentage rate increases can fluctuate greatly and be difficult to predict 
the company s general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation expense  employee benefits and rental expense for office facilities 
the company s policy acquisition costs include brokerage commissions and premium taxes both of which are primarily based on a percentage of premiums written 
acquisition costs have generally changed in proportion to changes in premium volume 
losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred in connection with insurance claims in any particular year depend upon a variety of factors including the rate of inflation  accident or claim frequency  the occurrence of natural catastrophes and the number of policies written 
the company estimates reserves each year based upon  and in conformity with  the factors discussed under business reserves 
changes in estimates of reserves are reflected in operating results in the year in which the change occurs 
year ended december  as compared to year ended december  net income for the year ended december  was million or per diluted share  as compared to million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  the decrease in net income in compared to was primarily attributable to realized investment gains and tax benefits resulting from the withdrawal from london operations in as described below 
net income for the year ended december  was million  or per diluted share  excluding realized investment gains after taxes of  or per diluted share 
net income for the year ended december  was million  or per diluted share  after excluding realized investment gains after taxes of million  or per diluted share  and million  or per diluted share  resulting from a non recurring tax benefit attributable to the company s withdrawal from its london operation in a reconciliation of net income excluding realized investment gains after taxes and tax benefits attributable to the company s withdrawal from its london operations to net income prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for the years ended december  and  respectively  is set forth below year ended december  in millions net income  excluding realized investment gains and tax benefits on the withdrawal from london operations realized investment gains after taxes 
tax benefits on the withdrawal from london operations net income net income excluding realized investment gains and tax benefits on the withdrawal from london operations is a non gaap financial measure and should be considered in addition to  but not as a substitute for  net income prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as a measure of profitability 
because realized investment gains in  which resulted primarily from the liquidation of the company s fixed income portfolio  and tax benefits on the withdrawal from london operations in were non recurring in nature  management believes that net income excluding realized investment gains and tax benefits on the withdrawal from london operations provides useful information regarding trends in the company s results of operations 
total revenues for the year ended december  were million compared with million for the year ended december  reflecting a decline in net premiums earned from lines of business in runoff 
net realized investment gains after taxes were  or 
per diluted share  and million  or 
per diluted share  in the years ended december  and  respectively 
the prior year amounts reflected the sale of substantially all of the company s fixed income investments 
gross premiums written  net premiums written and net premiums earned for the year ended december  declined by  and  respectively  when compared to the same period of as a result of the company s previously announced decisions to cease writing aircraft business and to withdraw from operations in london 
however  gross premiums written  net premiums written and net premiums earned from the company s core segments ocean marine  inland marine fire and other liability increased by  and  respectively  in over the same period of premiums for each segment are discussed below ocean marine gross premiums written grew by during when compared to the prior year 
the increase reflected higher ocean marine rates with the largest rate increases  approximately to  occurring in the marine liability and hull classes and additional production was achieved in the marine liability class 
other marine classes are currently experiencing a leveling in rates 
partially offsetting the overall increase were decreases in policy count in the drill rig class partly as a result of some one time builder s risk policies written in  which were not renewed in builder s risk policies may have policy terms greater than one year and accordingly its premium is earned over the related policy period 
in addition  we did not renew certain cargo policies in order to reduce concentrations of risk 
however  commencing in the fourth quarter of  gross premiums include cargo premiums from our recent agreement with southern marine aviation  a leading provider of insurance for bulk petroleum cargo shipments 
net premiums written decreased by and reflected larger amounts of ceded reinsurance premium as a result of the business mix within the various classes of ocean marine insurance 
ceded reinsurance premiums are earned over the policy terms of its related gross premium 
net premiums earned grew by in compared to reflecting premium rate increases as well as increased production in the marine liability classes 
the company cannot assure that rates will continue to increase in at the levels achieved in inland marine fire gross premiums written increased by for the year ended december  when compared to the prior year  largely due to the growth in the company s underwriting program insuring excess and surplus lines property risks and improved pricing 
both net premiums written and net premiums earned increased and  respectively over the comparable amounts reflecting increases in production  pricing and higher net loss retention levels 
other liability gross premiums written rose by for the year ended december  when compared to due to production increases from existing classes and new classes commercial automobile liability and excess workers compensation and higher premium rates on policy renewals 
average rate increases achieved in were approximately to 
although additional production was achieved in the contractor s liability class  policy count was reduced to mitigate exposure in certain classes of errors and omission policies 
new sources of production include underwriting a programmed book of commercial automobile liability insurance  which contributed million in gross premiums written in in addition  gross premiums written in also include million of excess workers compensation insurance focusing on smaller companies in the new york area 
net premiums written and net premiums earned grew by and  respectively over the prior year due to the premium rate and production increases as well as higher net loss retention levels in the contractor s liability and errors and omission classes 
the company cannot assure that rates will continue to increase in at the levels achieved in aircraft gross written premiums decreased in from million to million as a result of the company having ceased writing new aircraft policies subsequent to march  we expect aircraft premiums to be negligible in net premiums written and net premiums earned decreased in for the same reasons 
mmo london premiums earned were zero in  down from million in  because the company did not provide capacity to any lloyd s syndicate for the and subsequent underwriting years 
net losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred as a percentage of net premiums earned the loss ratio for the year ended december  was compared to for the year ended december  the company recorded lower loss ratios in in both the ocean marine and other liability lines of business  which largely reflected the absence of any catastrophe losses and the beneficial impact of increased rates in those lines of business 
net losses incurred from catastrophes in were million and in the company decreased net loss reserves by approximately million in from the year end reserve amount of million 
the benefit resulted from the favorable development of ocean marine reserves offset by the adverse development of aviation reserves attributable to accident years to and additional net loss development in its umbrella other liability losses of approximately million 
the year end results were affected by net adverse development of million resulting in part from provisions made for insolvent  financially impaired and commuted reinsurers  and million of adverse development from the company s other liability line reflecting additional umbrella exposures 
policy acquisition costs as a percentage of net premiums earned for the year ended december  were as compared with for the year ended december  net premiums earned in the prior year reflected larger amounts of aircraft premiums  which have a lower acquisition cost ratio than other lines of business 
accordingly  a large part of the aircraft premium written in reflected premium surcharges for terrorism coverage  which were recorded with a nominal processing charge 
premiums earned in included amounts from new sources of production  including commercial auto and cargo premiums  which have higher acquisition costs than other classes of business 
general  administrative and interest expenses increased by to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the prior year s amount included million in charges resulting from the reorganization of the company s management structure and consisted primarily of severance payments to three of the company s former executive officers 
all expenses related to the reorganization were paid prior to june  increases in expenses for were partly attributable to the company s new lease for its principal office space which became effective prior to the expiration on december  of the lease for the company s prior office location resulting in higher rent while both leases were in effect 
the company also incurred costs with respect to the implementation of computer systems 
the company s combined ratio the loss ratio plus the ratio of policy acquisition costs and general and administrative expenses divided by premiums earned was for the year compared with for net investment income for the year ended december  increased by to million from million in the year ended december  the increase in reflects the implementation of our revised investment strategy  including income derived from trading portfolio activities and limited partnerships  partially offset by a lower investment yield on the fixed income portfolio in as a result of a larger position held by the company in short term investments 
net investment income for reflects approximately million derived from trading portfolio activities  which commenced in the company s trading portfolio is marked to market with the change recognized in net investment income during the current period 
any realized gains or losses resulting from the sales of trading securities are also recognized in net investment income 
net investment income derived from limited partnership hedge fund investments approximated million in as compared to approximately  in the company initially invested in hedge funds in the fourth quarter of the equity method of accounting is used to account for the company s limited partnership hedge fund investments 
under the equity method  the company records all changes in the underlying value of the limited partnership hedge fund to results of operations 
as a result of the accounting treatment of its limited partnerships and trading portfolio  the company s investment income results may be more volatile 
the company s investments in limited partnership hedge funds amounted to approximately million and its trading account amounted to million as of december  commission and other income decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the prior year 
the amounts consisted primarily of income received from arbitration settlements  offset by returns of reinsurance profit contingent commissions 
in the second quarter of  an arbitration procedure was completed against a former pool member  utica mutual  which resulted in a payment to mmo of approximately million 
this amount represented utica mutual s funding requirement to the mmo pools 
in addition  mmo was awarded interest of approximately million on a pre tax basis 
in  larger profit commissions were earned based upon the ceded results of aircraft reinsurance treaties 
net realized investment gains were  for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the prior year amounts reflected the sale of substantially all of the company s fixed income investments 
write downs from other than temporary declines in the fair value of securities amounted to and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
total income taxes increased to million in from  for the amount for the prior year included million in tax benefits attributable to the company s withdrawal from its london operations 
premiums and other receivables  net decreased to million as of december  from million as of december  as a result of smaller balances due from the pool managed by mmo 
favorable cash flows were recorded at mmo due in part to the previously mentioned arbitration settlement and as a result of smaller investment balances held on behalf of its pool members 
reinsurance receivables on paid and unpaid losses  net  decreased to million and million  respectively  as of december  from million and million  respectively  as of december  due mainly to collections of reinsurance receivables on paid losses and the commutation of certain receivables 
unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses increased to million at december  from million at december  the increase of million was primarily attributable to increases in the ocean marine and other liability lines as a result of increased writings offset by declines in the aircraft line of business 
prepaid reinsurance premiums of million and reserve of unearned premiums of million as of december  each increased from the prior year end balances primarily due to increases in both ceded and gross writings in the ocean marine and other liability lines of business 
other liabilities increased to million as of december  from million for the same period of as a result of securities purchased but not yet settled 
ceded reinsurance payable increased to million at december  from million at december  as a result of the timing of reinsurance payments 
year ended december  as compared to year ended december  the company reported net income of million  or per diluted share  as compared to net losses of million  or per diluted share  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
a reconciliation of net income loss excluding realized investment gains after taxes and tax benefits attributable to the company s withdrawal from its london operations to net income prepared in accordance with generally acceptable accounting principles for the years ended december  and  respectively  is set forth below 
year ended december  in millions net income loss  excluding realized investment gains and tax benefits on the withdrawal from london operations realized investment gains after taxes tax benefits on the withdrawal from london operations net income loss net income loss excluding realized investment gains and tax benefits on the withdrawal from london operations is a non gaap financial measure and should be considered in addition to  but not as a substitute for  net income prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as a measure of profitability 
because realized investment gains in  which resulted primarily from the liquidation of the company s fixed income portfolio  and tax benefits on the withdrawal from london operations in were non recurring in nature  management believes that net income loss excluding realized investment gains and tax benefits on the withdrawal from london operations provides useful information regarding trends in the company s results of operations 
net realized investment gains after taxes of million  or 
per diluted share  and million  or 
per diluted share  were reported for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in  the company completed the withdrawal from its london operations  which resulted in a benefit of million  or 
per diluted share  resulting primarily from the realization of certain tax benefits 
also in  the company recorded a charge of million after taxes  or 
per diluted share  related to the reorganization of the company s management structure 
results for the year include after tax losses of approximately million  or 
per diluted share  resulting from the world trade center attack 
in addition  the company s results from operations were adversely affected by net losses from mmo london of million  or per diluted share 
net premiums earned for the year ended december  grew by  when compared to the same period of the prior year 
net premiums earned from the company s core lines of business for the year ended december  grew by when compared to the increases were achieved primarily as a result of rate increases 
net premiums earned for each segment are discussed below ocean marine net premiums earned grew by during when compared to and reflect higher ocean marine rates across the various ocean marine classes  particularly in the rig class  and additional production within the various marine classes of business 
the ocean marine line reflected average rate increases of to in other liability net premiums earned rose by during when compared to due to new production opportunities arising from policies covering errors and omissions professional liability risks  additional production in existing classes and larger premium rates on policy renewals 
the other liability line reflected average rate increases of to in and volume increases of approximately principally as a result of writing errors omissions insurance for a full year in as compared to half a year in inland marine fire net premiums earned increased for the year ended december  when compared to  largely due to an underwriting program insuring excess and surplus lines property risks and improved pricing 
the underwriting program commenced in july of the inland marine fire line recorded average rate increases of to in aircraft premiums earned grew for the year ended december  when compared to  despite a reduction in policy count  primarily as a result of rate increases 
contributing to the overall increase were premium surcharges for terrorism coverage written after september  the company recorded approximately million in gross premiums written from such premium surcharges in the prior year net premiums were adversely affected by reinstatement reinsurance costs of million incurred as a result of the wtc attack 
mmo london premiums earned for the year ended december  were down by to million from million in the prior year and reflected reduced capacity for premium writings at lloyd s 
the loss ratio was for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  the company reported higher loss ratios in as a result of losses sustained from the wtc attack and larger severity losses arising from higher net loss retentions in the aircraft segment of business 
underwriting losses from mmo london also contributed to higher overall loss ratios in the prior year 
in addition  the prior year loss ratio reflected larger charges for insolvent or financially impaired reinsurers of million as compared to million in calendar year a significant portion of such charges pertained to the to accident years in the aircraft segment of business and contributed to the adverse re estimation of net loss reserves 
the company reported lower overall loss ratios in as a result of a decrease in the frequency and severity of losses in the aircraft line when compared to however  the company recorded catastrophe losses of million  which adversely affected the ocean marine line in this compared to catastrophe losses of million in in the aircraft line 
the company increased net loss reserves by million in as compared to million in the company also increased net loss reserves for umbrella other liability losses by approximately million in as a result of the additional development of asbestos losses with respect to a few insureds 
this compared to a 
million increase in net reserves for umbrella losses in the and results were each affected by adverse development from ocean marine business written by mmo london 
the quality of the book written by mmo london was originally anticipated to be similar to that written by the mmo companies 
however  the loss experience revealed a lower quality book of business resulting from higher than expected claim frequencies and a longer than expected loss development pattern which caused the company to increase reserves substantially in and to a lesser extent in the adverse development recorded in and was partially offset by favorable development in the ocean marine line of business 
policy acquisition costs as a percentage of net premiums earned for the year ended december  were as compared with for the prior year 
the decrease in the percentage was primarily attributable to the aircraft expense ratio  which reflected a lower ratio as premium surcharges were recorded with a nominal processing charge 
the company s combined ratio improved to for the year compared with for excluding losses from the wtc attack  the combined ratio would have been in net investment income for the year ended december  decreased by to million from million for the same period of the decrease reflected lower investment yields as well as larger positions in tax exempt securities in  despite a larger investment asset base in income derived from hedge fund investments approximated million in compared to no similar amount in commission and other income  collectively  decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the prior year 
in  larger profit commissions were earned based upon the ceded results of aircraft reinsurance treaties 
general and administrative expenses increased by to million for the year ended december  when compared to million for the increase is principally attributable to million in charges resulting from the reorganization of the company s management structure in interest expense increased to  in from  in due to a larger amount of loan principal outstanding during the year 
net realized investment gains were million for the year ended december  as compared to net realized investment gains of million for the company realized investment gains on the sale of a substantial portion of its fixed maturities portfolio in in an effort to reposition the portfolio 
however  such investment gains in were partially offset by realized investment losses on both the sale of the company s common stock portfolio and sale of lower rated fixed maturities 
the income tax provision reflects approximately million of tax benefits realized from the completion of the company s withdrawal from its london operations 
excluding this benefit  income taxes as a percentage of income before taxes were in premiums and other receivables  net  decreased to million at the end of from million at the end of the decrease was largely attributable to smaller balances due from the pool managed by mmo as a result of favorable cash flows and smaller investment balances held by the pool 
premium receivables from runoff segments aircraft and mmo london have also decreased since the prior year 
reinsurance receivables on paid and unpaid losses  net  decreased to million as of december  from million for the same period of the decrease is largely attributable to smaller loss recoveries from runoff segments aircraft and mmo london and to the commutation of certain reinsurance receivable balances 
prepaid reinsurance premiums of million and reserve of unearned premiums of million as of december  each decreased from the year end balances primarily due to reductions in the amount of inforce premiums from the aircraft and mmo london segments 
accumulated other comprehensive income decreased to 
million as of december  from million as of december  the change principally reflects the sale of a substantial amount of the fixed maturity and equity security portfolios in the change in unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses and reinsurance receivables in was largely attributable to gross losses of million and reinsurance receivables of million  respectively  incurred from the world trade center attack 
the change in unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses and reinsurance receivables in was largely attributable to smaller loss payments and recoveries from segments aircraft and mmo london of the company that are no longer actively underwritten and to the commutation of certain reinsurance receivable balances 
the change in other liabilities in was a result of increases in funds held from reinsurers in order to collateralize their obligations to the company as required by provisions of various reinsurance treaties 
funds obtained from reinsurers are invested by mmo for the benefit of the company in the insurance pools managed by mmo 
the change in premium and other receivables in was attributable to larger amounts due from the pools managed by mmo as a result of larger investment balances held by the pool 
premium receivables from segments aircraft and mmo london where the company is no longer actively underwriting have also decreased since liquidity and capital resources the company monitors cash and short term investments in order to have an adequate level of funds available to satisfy claims and expenses as they become due 
as of december   the company s assets included approximately million in cash and short term investments 
the amount of short term investments held is a direct result of the company s concern over the prospects of rising interest rates in the near future 
the primary sources of the company s liquidity are funds generated from insurance premiums  investment income and maturing or liquidating investments 
cash flows provided by operating activities were million for the year ended december  cash of million was used in to establish the company s trading portfolio  whose trading activities included collateralized debt obligations and certain other securities with fixed maturities 
as the company commenced its trading portfolio in  any amounts purchased by the company would be reflected as a use of cash from operating activities 
in addition  cash flows in reflected larger amounts received from collections of both reinsurance and premium and other receivables than in paid losses were also lower in  reflecting lower amounts paid from runoff lines aircraft and mmo london and the commutation of certain loss reserves 
cash flows from operating activities in and amounted to million and million  respectively  resulting primarily from increases in premiums 
cash flows in reflected significant amounts received from aircraft premiums as a result of premium surcharges for terrorism coverage 
a substantial portion of such cash flows provided from operating activities was then used in investing activities to purchase fixed maturities 
further increasing cash flows in was the commutation of ceded loss reserves that contributed approximately million to cash flows 
the company s loss payments on asbestos environmental business  however  adversely affected cash flows during the past three years 
financing activities occurred in as a result of borrowings under the company s revolving credit agreement and unsecured credit facility 
the company borrowed approximately million in to assist in the payment of gross losses of the company 
the loan amounts resulted from draw downs on existing letters of credit provided to support the company s uk operations 
repayments under the company s prior loan facility were made at  per quarter in in  the company entered into a credit agreement with an unaffiliated company 
the agreement combined the company s existing credit agreements together with a facility to fund future cash draw downs on the letters of credit issued on behalf of the company to fund losses in mmo london 
during  the remaining balance of the letters of credit issued on behalf of the company was fully drawn down approximately million and such payments were funded entirely under the credit agreement 
approximately million of the loan balance was repaid in from cash derived from operating activities

critical accounting policies the company discloses significant accounting policies in the notes to its financial statements 
management considers certain accounting policies to be critical for the understanding of the company s financial statements 
such policies require significant management judgment and the resulting estimates have a material effect on reported results and will vary to the extent that future events affect such estimates and cause them to differ from the estimates provided currently 
these critical accounting policies include unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses  allowance for doubtful accounts and impairment of investments 
unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses are based on individual case estimates for losses reported 
a provision is also included  based on actuarial estimates utilizing historical trends in the frequency and severity of paid and reported claims  for losses incurred but not reported  salvage and subrogation recoveries and for loss adjustment expenses 
unpaid losses with respect to asbestos environmental risks are difficult for management to estimate and require considerable judgment due to the uncertainty regarding the significant issues surrounding such claims 
for a further discussion concerning asbestos environmental reserves see reserves 
unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses amounted to million and million at december  and  respectively 
unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses  net of reinsurance amounted to million and million at december  and  respectively 
both the gross and net unpaid loss reserve estimates as of december  have been reasonably estimated as reserve changes of less than one percent were reported in on their respective balances 
management continually reviews and updates the estimates for unpaid losses and any changes resulting therefrom are reflected in operating results currently 
the potential for future adverse or favorable loss development is highly uncertain and subject to a variety of factors including  but not limited to  court decisions  legislative actions and inflation 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on management s review of amounts due from insolvent or financially impaired companies 
allowances are estimated for both premium receivables and reinsurance receivables 
management continually reviews and updates such estimates for any changes in the financial status of companies 
for a further discussion concerning reinsurance receivables see reinsurance ceded 
the allowance for doubtful accounts on reinsurance receivables amounted to million and million at december  and  respectively 
the allowance for doubtful accounts on premiums and other receivables amounted to  as of december  and  respectively

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk includes the potential for future losses due to changes in the fair value of financial instruments  which relates mainly to the company s investment portfolio 
those risks associated with the investment portfolio include the effects of exposure to adverse changes in interest rates  credit quality and hedge fund and equity investments 
the largest market risk to the company is interest rate risk 
interest rate risk includes the changes in the fair value of fixed maturities based upon changes in interest rates 
the company considers interest rate risk and the overall duration of the company s loss reserves in evaluating the company s investment portfolio 
the following tabular presentation outlines the expected cash flows of fixed maturities available for sale for each of the next five years and the aggregate cash flows expected for the remaining years thereafter based upon maturity dates 
fixed maturities include taxable and tax exempt securities with applicable weighted average interest rates 
future cash flows of expected principal amounts dollars in millions total total there amortized fair fixed maturities after cost value tax exempts average interest rate 
taxables average interest rate total credit quality risk includes the risk of default by issuers of debt securities 
as of december   of the fair value of the company s fixed income and short term investment portfolios were considered investment grade 
as of december   the company invested approximately million in fixed maturities that are below investment grade  with a concentration in investments rated bb by standard and poor s 
the company seeks to mitigate market risk associated with such investments by maintaining a diversified portfolio of such securities that limits the concentration of investment in any one issuer 
the largest single investment made by the company in such securities amounted to of the total amount invested in below investment grade securities 
hedge fund risk includes the potential loss from the diminution in the value of the underlying investment of the hedge fund 
hedge fund investments are subject to various economic and market risks 
the risks associated with hedge fund investments may be substantially greater than the risks associated with fixed income investments 
consequently  our hedge fund portfolio may be more volatile  and the risk of loss greater  than that associated with fixed income investments 
as the company invests a greater percentage of its investment portfolio in limited partnership hedge funds  there may also be a greater volatility associated with the company s investment income 
each of the insurance company subsidiaries has revised its investment policy and now limits the amount of hedge fund investments to the greater of of invested assets or of policyholders surplus 
the company also seeks to mitigate market risk associated with its investments in hedge funds by maintaining a diversified portfolio of hedge fund investments 
diversification is achieved through the use of many investment managers employing a variety of different investment strategies in determining the underlying characteristics of their hedge funds 
the company is dependent upon these managers to obtain market prices for the underlying investments of the hedge funds 
some of these investments may be difficult to value and actual values may differ from reported amounts 
the hedge funds in which we invest usually impose limitations on the timing of withdrawals from the hedge funds most are within days  and may affect our liquidity 
with respect to an investment in a limited partnership managed by a mariner affiliated company and consolidated in the company s financial statements  the company cannot withdraw funds for a minimum period of three years without the consent of the hedge fund manager 
the company invests in cdos  which are private placements 
the fair value of each security is provided by securities dealers 
the markets for these types of securities can be illiquid and  therefore  the price obtained from dealers on these securities is subject to change  depending upon the underlying market conditions of these securities  including the potential for downgrades or defaults on the underlying collateral of the security 
the company seeks to mitigate market risk associated with such investments by maintaining a diversified portfolio of such securities that limits the concentration of investment in any one issuer 
the excess of fair value over the cost of the cdos was recorded in net investment income and amounted to 
million at december  the largest single investment made by the company in such securities amounted to of the total amount invested in cdo securities 
the company monitors market risks on a regular basis through meetings with mariner  examining the existing portfolio and reviewing potential changes in investment guidelines  the overall effect of which is to allow management to make informed decisions concerning the impact that market risks have on the portfolio
