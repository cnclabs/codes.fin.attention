item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations please read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations together with item selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements included elsewhere in this report 
the following discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including  but not limited to  those set forth under item business risks related to our business and elsewhere in this report 
general we are a leading regional provider of network infrastructure and ip telephony solutions including related implementation and support services 
the ip telephony industry is characterized by rapidly evolving and competing technologies 
our three principal offices are located in texas  and we primarily market to potential customers headquartered in  or making purchasing decisions from  texas 
our long term goal  however  is to become one of the leading national providers of cisco centric network and ip telephony solutions to enterprises 
we begin management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations with an overview of our strategies for achieving this goal and becoming profitable 
from a financial perspective  these operating strategies have a number of important implications for our results of operations and financial condition 
strategy we plan to become profitable in by implementing the strategies discussed below 
we believe that our strategies will allow us to continue to increase total revenues in importantly  we also believe our strategies will enable us to improve our gross profit in by improving our gross margins on inx revenue 
at the same time  we will seek to contain the relatively fixed components of our selling  general and administrative expenses so that those components become a relatively smaller percentage of total revenues 
although selling expenses can generally be expected to increase as our revenues increase  we believe that if we are successful in implementing our strategies  many general and administrative expenses such as management salaries  administrative wages and professional expenses will decrease as a percentage of our total revenues 
our key operating strategies are as follows seeking larger  full scale ip telephony implementation projects  as opposed to smaller pilot projects  increasing the gross revenues from our higher gross margin operations  such as inx services and stratasoft custom projects  as opposed to product sales  which typically produce lower gross margins  aligning ourselves with cisco as our exclusive supplier for the network and ip telephony equipment and technology that we offer  expanding geographically by acquiring complementary businesses and by opening our own offices  and developing and marketing our own computer telephony software that operates with and augments cisco centric ip telephony products 
if we are successful in obtaining larger  full scale ip telephony implementation projects  we expect that our gross revenues from both products and services will increase because these projects  by their nature  typically require a substantially higher level of our services and more products than do smaller projects 
larger projects  however  can strain our financial resources 
for example  a potential customer for a major ip telephony project may require that we post a bid bond or performance bond in order for us to be awarded the project 
this often occurs on competitive bids 
because of our financial condition  bonding companies typically require that we provide security to collateralize the issuance of its bond 
we have been financially unable to provide sufficient collateral in some instances  and as a result have not been able to obtain the bond 
we believe we have occasionally lost business that we might have otherwise been awarded because we were unable to obtain the bond required by the potential customer 
we compete with larger and better financed entities that do not face the same difficulties obtaining bonds 
increases in the size and volume of ip telephony projects we undertake can also challenge our cash management 
for example  larger projects can reduce our available cash by causing us to carry higher levels of inventory 
larger projects can also require us to invest our available cash in labor costs 
this is because  in some cases  we do not receive payments from our customers for extended periods of time 
until they pay us  all the cash we previously invested in labor and products on the project remains tied up 
we expect that greater amounts of our cash will become invested in accounts receivable in the future if we are successful in growing our business as we intend 
to meet our cash requirements to support this growth  we expect to rely on capital provided from our operations and our credit facility  which is collateralized by our accounts receivable and substantially all of our assets 
we also expect to raise capital through a public offering of our equity securities 
although over of our revenue in was attributable to product sales  the gross profit margins on sales of our services have been substantially higher than those for sales of products  with the exception of sales of our proprietary stratasoft software products 
in  for example  the gross profit margin on sales of products by inx was  while the gross profit margin on sales of services by inx for that year was 
we therefore plan to increase revenue from services  particularly our post implementation services for ip telephony 
the success of this aspect of our strategy largely depends on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled and experienced employees 
for the last three years  the largest component of our total cost of sales and service has been purchases of cisco centric ip telephony products by inx 
the majority of those purchases were directly from cisco 
we typically purchase from various wholesale distributors only when we cannot timely purchase products directly from cisco 
our reliance on cisco as the primary supplier for the network and ip telephony equipment and technology we offer means that our results of operations from period to period depend substantially on the terms that we are able to purchase these products from cisco and  to a much lesser extent  from wholesale distributors of cisco s products 
therefore  our ability to manage the largest component of our cost of sales and service is very limited and depends to a large degree on maintaining and growing our relationship with cisco 
our cost of products purchased from cisco can be substantially influenced by whether cisco sponsors sales incentive programs and whether we qualify for the incentives that cisco offers 
we plan to also grow our business in other geographic areas through strategic acquisition of similar businesses or by opening our own offices 
this aspect of our strategy can affect our financial condition and results of operations in many ways 
the purchase price for business acquisitions and the costs of opening offices may require substantial cash and may require us to incur long term debt 
the expenses of a geographic expansion in an area may well exceed the revenues attributable to a new business or office for some time  even if it performs as we expect 
additionally  it is possible that our acquisition activities may require that we record substantial amounts of goodwill if the purchase consideration paid for an acquisition exceeds the estimated fair value of the net identified tangible and intangible assets acquired 
to the extent an acquisition results in goodwill  we will reevaluate the realizability of that goodwill at least annually and adjust it as appropriate 
the resulting adjustment could result in significant charges to earnings in future periods 
developing new or substantially improved computer telephony software products will likely require us to expend cash and record software development expenses 
software development costs will likely be expensed as incurred because we expect to incur substantially all costs prior to achieving technological feasibility in developing a new or substantially improved software product 
future minority interest in inx since its formation in  inx has been our wholly owned subsidiary 
beginning in april  however  we expect inx will cease to be a wholly owned subsidiary as the result of the anticipated issuance of inx common stock to digital precision  which inx acquired in april in connection with that acquisition  we agreed to issue to the seller million shares of inx common stock as additional purchase consideration for its business if certain employees remain employed through april   the first anniversary of the acquisition 
we expect that these conditions will be met and that the inx stock will be issued in april when that occurs  we anticipate that our ownership percentage of inx s common stock then outstanding will decline to approximately inx has also granted  stock options to employees of inx to acquire inx common stock pursuant to a stock option plan for inx employees 
the exercise prices for the inx options range from to with a weighted average of 
additionally  the i sector warrant entitles us to acquire an additional million shares of inx common stock at an exercise price of per share 
we estimate that i sector s ownership in inx could be reduced to  assuming that all of the inx options are exercised  we exercise the i sector warrant and there are no other changes in inx s equity 
if the i sector warrant is not exercised  we estimate that our ownership in inx would be reduced to assuming the inx stock is issued in april and all inx options are exercised 
the terms of the inx options and the i sector warrant are discussed further in note to the consolidated financial statements and in executive compensation 
while the existence of the unexercised inx options and the contingent obligation to issue inx stock do not result in a minority interest for accounting purposes  the actual issuance of inx stock in april will result in a minority interest 
because i sector will own less than all of inx s stock  its interest in inx s future profits and losses will be reduced 
under us generally accepted accounting principles  we expect that i sector s consolidated financial statements will reflect a minority interest adjustment of the otherwise reportable profits and losses of inx by the percentage of minority ownership in inx during the period covered by the financial statements 
i sector s percentage share of any cash dividends or other distributions paid by inx to its stockholders will likewise be reduced by the percentage of minority ownership in inx 
additionally  if the percentage of minority ownership of inx s stock grows as a result of future exercises of inx options  that increase will cause a corresponding decrease in the reportable share of inx s profits and losses included in our consolidated financial statements  and our share of cash dividends and other distributions from inx 
the following table summarizes the pro forma effect on our consolidated net loss for if  as of january   we exercised the i sector warrant  all inx options were exercised and all the inx shares we expect to issue in connection with the digital precision acquisition were issued december  in thousands net loss as reported  assumed minority interest in inx income adjusted pro forma net loss  as a result of the adjustment to net income  our pro forma consolidated balance sheet would include a liability entitled minority interest of  and our stockholders equity would be reduced by  unlike the boards of directors of our wholly owned subsidiaries  the board of directors of inx will be required to be mindful of the interests of inx s minority stockholders  in addition to our interests  when considering whether to approve business and financing transactions involving inx 
for example  we may be unable to cause the assets of inx to be pledged as collateral security for indebtedness if the proceeds of that indebtedness disproportionately benefit us or our wholly owned subsidiaries in relation to inx 
conflicts of interest may reduce our flexibility in structuring business and financing transactions beneficial to us and our wholly owned subsidiaries 
contributions of capital to inx by us  in the form of stock purchases  which may be necessary to fund inx s growth  could increase our percentage ownership of inx but would use capital 
because of the potential minority interest in inx  we will be required to make capital contributions to inx on a basis that is  in the good faith judgment of our board of directors  fair to us and the holders of the minority interest 
minority stock ownership in inx could also subject us to lawsuits from its minority stockholders complaining of our actions with respect to inx and its minority stockholders  even if the actions complained of are ultimately determined to have been proper 
for example  if we choose to cause inx to merge with  or sell all or substantially all of its assets to  another entity  the minority stockholders of inx may bring lawsuits seeking to block the transaction or seeking to exercise statutory dissenters rights with respect to the transaction 
whether or not successful  any such actions would cause us to incur litigation costs and potentially reduce the benefit of any such transaction to us 
the stock of inx is not publicly traded 
accordingly  any shares of inx stock issued  including those issued to the former owners of digital precision upon exercise of inx options  are  and will be for the foreseeable future  relatively illiquid 
for this reason  and to eliminate the other consequences of having a minority interest in a subsidiary  we believe that in the future we will offer to exchange inx stock and stock options for common stock or stock options to acquire our common stock 
if we conclude such a transaction  the aggregate ownership percentage of our common stock by our stockholders immediately before the conversion or exchange transaction will be reduced by the percentage of post transaction ownership acquired by the former minority stockholders of inx 
their post transaction ownership may be further reduced by subsequent exercises of i sector stock options that we may choose to exchange for inx stock options 
we cannot predict the percentage of ownership reduction to our stockholders that may result from any future exchange or conversion of inx stock and inx options 
the ownership reduction resulting from any such transaction may  however  be significant 
we believe this may be the case principally because we expect that the total number of shares of our common stock that we would be required to issue in any such transaction would be approximately equivalent in value  as determined at a future date  to the value of the inx stock and inx options to be exchanged at the same future date  the historical financial effect of inx on our business is significant  as compared with our other subsidiaries  and we expect inx will continue to generate most of our revenue 
if in the future we propose to exchange or convert inx stock and inx options into i sector common stock or options  we intend to appoint a special committee of our independent directors to negotiate any exchange ratio for the transaction with the principal inx minority stockholders and option holders 
the facts and circumstances that the special committee may choose to consider and the relative weights to be accorded them in negotiating the relative values of our common stock and inx stock and in negotiating the exchange ratio for any future transaction are matters that we intend to delegate to the discretion of the special committee 
accordingly  presently we cannot quantify the amount of any future ownership reduction that our stockholders may experience in an exchange transaction with inx stockholders and option holders 
under some circumstances  we may be required by generally accepted accounting principles to record substantial non cash expenses if we choose to exchange inx stock or inx options into our common stock or options 
we are not now able to determine the amount or timing of any such charges 
this is because those matters will largely depend upon the timing and terms on which any future exchange would occur  particularly the exchange ratio negotiated at the time 
because most of our revenues in were generated by inx and our expectation is that this will continue for the foreseeable future  we believe that any resulting non cash charges could be substantial 
any such future non cash charges could materially and adversely affect our financial results 
if we determine to undertake a transaction to exchange inx stock or inx options into our common stock or stock options  we also plan to submit any such transaction to our stockholders for their approval  even if not required by delaware law or the rules of the american stock exchange 
even if we believe that such transaction is in our best interest  our stockholders may refuse to approve it 
if that were to occur  it could disappoint the expectations of those inx minority stockholders and inx option holders in favor of the transaction  some of who are currently  and are expected to remain  key employees 
this could cause employee morale and retention problems for us 
results of operations overview sources of revenue 
our revenue is derived from three segments represented by our three operating subsidiaries  which are inx  stratasoft and valerent 
during the year ended december   inx  stratasoft and valerent accounted for  and  respectively  of total consolidated revenue  and of subsidiary revenue was eliminated in consolidation due to intercompany transactions 
inx revenue consists of product and service revenue 
product revenue consists of reselling cisco products and limited amounts of complementary products by other manufacturers 
service revenue is generated by fees from a variety of implementation and support services 
product prices for inx are set by the market for cisco products  and provide our lowest gross margins 
service revenue for inx has recently provided a higher gross margin that has generally improved over the past several years as the cost of inx s technical resources  which are reflected as a cost of service  has decreased as a percentage of service revenue 
also  certain fixed and flat fee service contracts that extend over three months or more are accounted for using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
historically  the majority of inx s service revenue has been generated from implementation services  which is project oriented and tends to be volatile as projects are completed and new projects commence 
as the number  frequency and size of inx projects has grown  inx has achieved better utilization of its engineering resources resulting in improved services gross margins 
the normal sales cycles for corporate customers typically ranges from three to six months depending on the nature  scope and size of the deal involved 
but our direct experience with school districts involved in the e rate program a governmental funding program for schools indicates that the sales lead time is generally about six to months 
in mid  inx introduced netsurant  its branded support service that consists primarily of customer service personnel and a support center that we believe could further improve overall services gross margins 
through  netsurant service revenue was not significant 
stratasoft revenue consists primarily of custom project revenue from the sale of proprietary computer telephony software 
our stratasoft revenue is reported as custom project revenue in our financial statements  because it consists of product and services which cannot be accounted for separately 
stratasoft has traditionally provided our highest gross margin since it is primarily sales of our proprietary computer telephony software 
our cost of goods sold for stratasoft s custom project revenue includes the cost of developing our computer telephony software products  installation costs  and the cost of hardware and other equipment bundled with our software applications and included in a sale to a customer 
stratasoft revenue also includes sales to resellers 
the sales to resellers are recorded when the sale becomes fixed or determinable  otherwise revenue from resellers is recorded when payments become due 
valerent revenue consists of both product revenue and service revenue 
product revenue consists of reselling primarily software products and  to a lesser degree  hardware products that facilitate valerent s managed services  including remote management software products from altiris  inc  and security software products from network associates  inc product sales prices for valerent are set by the market for these products  and valerent s product sales have typically provided lower gross profit margins than its service revenue 
valerent s service revenue consists of remote and onsite technical assistance to its customers 
valerent s gross margin on service revenue  much like inx s implementation service revenue  is subject to variability based upon the utilization of valerent s billable technical resources 
recurring service agreements exist with some customers  but usually with varying terms and conditions that conform to their year over year business changes and specific needs 
these agreements provide predictable and stable sources of revenue  the loss of a recurring agreement could disrupt the stability of that revenue stream for valerent 
gross profit and gross profit margin 
the mix of our various revenue components  each of which has substantially different gross margin  materially influences our overall gross profit and gross margin in any particular quarter 
in periods in which service revenue or stratasoft custom project revenue is high  as compared to inx and valerent product sales  our gross margin generally improves as compared to periods in which we have higher levels of product sales 
our gross margin for product sales also varies depending on the type of product sold and the mix of large revenue product contracts  which typically have lower gross margin  as compared to smaller revenue product contracts  which typically have a higher gross margin 
in addition  our quarterly gross profit and gross margin can be materially affected by vendor incentives received in certain quarterly periods  most of which are cisco incentives received by inx 
the incentive programs sponsored by cisco currently enable us to qualify for cash rebates or product pricing discounts 
these incentives are generally earned based on sales volume  sales growth and  in some cases  customer satisfaction levels 
the amounts earned under these programs are recorded as a reduction of cost of goods and can vary significantly between periods 
currently  incentives by cisco are paid semiannually  and are typically paid in the first and third quarters of each calendar year 
incentives are recognized when we receive payment from the supplier or when we have earned and can reasonably estimate the amount due from the supplier 
expenses 
a significant portion of our cost of services for each of our service businesses is composed of labor 
labor cost related to permanent employees is generally fixed in the short term so that higher levels of service revenue produce higher gross margins while lower levels of service revenue produce lower gross margins 
our gross margin on service revenue fluctuates from period to period depending not only upon the prices charged to customers for our services  but also upon the level of utilization of our technical staff 
management of labor cost is therefore important in order to prevent erosion of gross margin 
our gross margin is also impacted by such factors as contract size  time and material pricing versus fixed fee pricing  discounting  vendor incentives and other business and marketing factors normally incurred during the conduct of business 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
our selling  general and administrative expenses include both fixed and variable expenses 
relatively fixed expenses in selling  general and administrative expenses include rent  utilities  promotion and advertising  and administrative wages 
variable expenses in selling  general and administrative expenses include sales commissions and travel  which will usually vary based on our sales and gross profit 
selling  general and administrative expenses also include expenses which vary significantly from period to period but not in proportion to sales or gross profit 
these include legal expenses and bad debt expense both of which vary based on factors that are difficult to predict 
a significant portion of our selling  general and administrative expenses relate to personnel costs  some of which are variable and others that are relatively fixed 
our variable personnel costs consist primarily of sales commissions 
sales commissions are typically calculated based upon our gross profit on a particular sales transaction and thus generally fluctuate because of the size of the deal and the mix of associated products and services with our overall gross profit 
bad debt expense generally fluctuates somewhat in proportion to increases or decreases in revenue levels  although not always in the same periods as increases or decreases in revenue 
legal expense varies based on legal issue activity  which can vary substantially from period to period 
the remainder of selling  general and administrative expenses are relatively fixed and do not vary in direct proportion to increases or decreases in revenue 
acquisition and disposition 
in the second quarter of  inx acquired the fixed assets  inventory  intellectual property  customer lists  trademarks  trade names service marks  contract rights and other intangibles of digital precision 
in connection with that acquisition we also assumed leases for equipment and office space 
our results of operations include those attributable to digital precision on and after april  the purchase price for digital precision was  in cash and million shares of inx common stock that we agreed to issue if certain employees remain employed through april   the first anniversary of the acquisition 
we did not recognize goodwill at the time of the acquisition of digital precision  but we may recognize goodwill in connection with the anticipated issuance of the million shares of inx stock in april the sale of our computer reselling and pbx telephone systems reselling business in early and the sale of our it staffing business in resulted in a gain on disposal 
since the sale of these businesses  we have realized  in various periods  income and expense from discontinued operations that have been primarily a result of litigation expenses and settlement of litigation related to our discontinued operations 
we expect the income and expense from discontinued operations to decrease over time and to eventually be eliminated after these matters are fully resolved 
tax loss carryforward 
because of our operating losses in  we have accumulated a net operating loss carryforward for federal income tax purposes that  as of december   was approximately million and is available to offset future federal and state taxable income 
this carryforward expires in in addition to potential expiration  there are several factors that could limit or eliminate our ability to use these carryforwards 
for example  under section of the internal revenue code of  as amended  use of prior net operating loss carryforwards is limited after an ownership change 
this type of change could result from an offering that we are contemplating  either alone or in combination with other prior or subsequent offerings of equity securities 
if we achieve sustained profitability  which may not happen  the use of net operating loss carryforwards would reduce our tax liability and increase our net income and available cash resources 
when all operating loss carryforwards have been used or have expired  we would again be subject to increased tax expense and reduced earnings due to such tax expense

our total revenue  net of intercompany eliminations  increased by million  or  from million to million 
inx revenue increased by million  or  from million to million 
as a percentage of total revenue  inx revenue increased from to 
of the increase  million was attributed to the houston office  million was attributed to a new office in austin  million was attributed to government sector sales and million was attributed to the dallas office 
the increase in revenue attributable to the digital precision acquisition  including the million of revenue of the acquired austin office  was million 
inx s revenue grew rapidly primarily due to large sales to four school districts totaling million and due to synergy of million resulting from its acquisition of digital precision 
the sales to the school districts are one time competitive bid events fostered by the e rate program that provides schools with of their funding for internet related expenditures  and there can be no assurance as to the level of revenue provided  if any  in future periods from school districts 
stratasoft revenue increased by  or  from million to million 
as a percentage of total revenue  stratasoft revenue decreased from to 
stratasoft s increased revenue was primarily the result of two large international custom projects in  as compared to no individually large custom projects initiated during this was slightly offset by deferred revenue for certain custom projects that included fees that were determined to not be fixed and determinable in stratasoft s international sales accounted for of stratasoft s revenue as compared to in stratasoft has it own internally managed sales force  but it also utilizes dealer agreements from time to time with certain established resellers in domestic and international markets that do not require the continued involvement of our personnel 
stratasoft derived  or of its revenue from sales to resellers in which compares with  or of revenue in sales to resellers are included in revenue when the fees are fixed and determinable  otherwise revenue from resellers is deferred and recognized when the payment becomes due 
valerent revenue increased by  or  from million to million 
as a percentage of total revenue  valerent revenue decreased from to 
the increase in valerent revenue was primarily attributable to decreased service revenue of  offset by increased product sales of  the decrease in service revenue is primarily attributable to the loss of revenue from certain customers of  which was primarily related to valerent making changes to its business model so that it no longer pursued certain non strategic sources of service revenue 
valerent s business model now focuses on identifying and developing markets with enterprise customers and we expect that the redirection will provide generally improved margins in the future 
gross profit 
our total gross profit increased by million  or  from million to million 
gross margin increased from to  primarily because of the increase in gross margin in our inx and stratasoft subsidiaries as discussed below 
inx gross profit increased million  or  from million to million 
inx s gross margin increased from to 
inx s gross profit on its product sales component increased million or  from million to million due to increased product sales revenue and a vendor rebate of  inx s gross profit on its service component increased million  from  to million  and service gross margin improved from to  as a result of significantly increased service revenue of million with a somewhat fixed cost of service component due to improved utilization of technical personnel 
stratasoft gross profit increased by  or  from million to million 
stratasoft s gross margin increased from to 
stratasoft gross profit was impacted by the mix of sales between systems sales  which include a hardware component  as compared to software only sales  which do not have a hardware component 
stratasoft s increased gross profit is primarily due to an increased software only component relative to the systems sales component of total stratasoft sales 
software only sales primarily relate to reseller customers and do not require the continuing involvement of our personnel 
valerent gross profit increased by  or 
valerent s gross margin increased from to 
valerent s cost of service consists primarily of fixed labor cost that does not fluctuate directly with changes in revenue 
valerent improved its utilization of its labor pool by reducing the number of technicians employed and lowering its fixed cost  which contributed to improved gross profits 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or from million to million 
as a percentage of total revenue  these expenses decreased  from to 
sales compensation increased  due to corresponding increase in sales 
legal and professional fees increased  due to an equal employment opportunity commission claim  collection efforts  and commercial disputes in the ordinary course of business 
administrative compensation expense increased  due to hiring additional inx and stratasoft personnel in houston  dallas  canada and india 
payroll tax expense increased  correspondingly with compensation expenses 
contract labor expense increased  to supplement technical service labor need to fulfill contractual obligations 
travel expense increased  primarily due to stratasoft international travel and inx travel for technical staff and management 
general office expenses increased  due to printing and general growth 
insurance expense increased  because of rate increases and volume increases 
stockholder relations expense increased  due to employing a shareholder relations firm  attending investor conferences and visiting investor groups 
depreciation expense increased  due to asset additions and the digital precision acquisition in april rents increased  due to additional office space in austin and dallas 
other corporate expenses increased  due to our overall growth 
operating loss 
operating loss decreased  or  from million to million  primarily due to the million increase in gross profit being offset by the million increase in selling  general and administrative expenses 
inx s operating profit increased million  or  from a loss of  to a profit of  stratasoft s operating loss increased million  or  from a loss of  to a loss of million 
valerent s operating loss decreased  or  from million to  the operating loss for the corporate segment increased  or  from a loss of  to an operating loss of million 
interest and other income  net 
interest and other income  net  decreased by  or  from  to  primarily due to a decrease in interest income of  or  from  to  which is attributable to interest on the settlement of a past due customer account in the decrease in interest income was also affected by an increase in interest expense of  or  from  to  due to increased borrowings used to finance inventory purchases to supply the increased business activity 
our borrowings under the textron credit facility increased from million to million while the interest bearing portion of our borrowings increased from at december  to million at december  foreign exchange loss increased  from to a loss of  other income increased  or  from a loss of  to  net loss 
the net loss increased million  or  from  to million 
the benefit for income taxes decreased million  or  from million to  because the job creation and worker assistance act of provided for the carryback of net operating losses for any taxable year ending during or to each of the five tax years preceding the loss year  we were able to use our net operating loss carryback 
the benefit in includes amounts related to additional carryback benefits for not previously recorded 
discontinued operations 
during  we discontinued our telecom systems business 
on march  we entered into an agreement to sell certain assets of  and the ongoing operation of  our computer products division 
the sale transaction closed on may  on december   we sold our it staffing business 
as a consequence of these events  the operations of these businesses are reported as discontinued operations 
for the year ended december   the gain on disposal related to these three businesses was   and  net of taxes of   and  for a net total of  for the year ended december  the gain on disposal related to these three businesses was   and  net of taxes of   and  for a total gain of  the gains and or losses on disposal related to these discontinued operations are primarily related to collections of accounts receivables retained when these businesses were sold 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenue 
total revenue increased million  or  from million to million 
international sales accounted for million  or  of consolidated revenue as compared to  and were primarily derived from the stratasoft segment 
inx revenue increased million  or  from million to million 
as a percentage of total revenue  inx revenue increased from to 
inx s growth in revenue related to products primarily in the houston market  where its revenue increased by million  and in the dallas market  where its revenue expanded by million 
during november  inx achieved gold status with cisco  its primary product line manufacturer  which allows inx to purchase directly from cisco at lower pricing levels and enhances inx s relationship with cisco in the areas of lead generation  joint marketing and technical support 
stratasoft revenue decreased  or  from million to million 
as a percentage of total revenue  stratasoft revenue decreased from to 
a large portion of orders in the fourth quarter of were booked late in the quarter  resulting in less progress toward completion and lower recognized revenue in that quarter in the current year 
additionally  included eight large international projects that were substantially completed during and were not replicated 
stratasoft s international revenue decreased million  or from million of its total revenue to million of its total revenue 
valerent revenue decreased  or  from million to million 
as a percentage of total revenue  revenue decreased from to 
the decrease in revenue is attributable to the loss of service revenue from certain customers of  and a decision not to participate in the national service network  a network of information technology organizations that provide service and support for regional and national customers through the certified services professionals employed by its participants  resulting in decreased revenue of  gross profit 
gross profit increased million  or  from million to million 
gross margin decreased from to 
the primary reason for the decrease in gross margin is the rapid growth in the inx segment that experiences lower gross margin because of a high proportion of its revenue being derived from product sales 
inx gross profit increased million  or  from million to million 
inx s gross margin increased from to 
inx s product gross profit increased million from million to million due to the sales volume increase offset by gross margin decreases from to 
inx s gross profit on its service component improved  or  from  to  due to better utilization of technical personnel 
the overall increase in gross profit is consistent with an increase in revenue of million  and with better pricing from cisco after achieving cisco gold levels  along with higher levels of service revenue 
stratasoft gross profit decreased  or  from million to million 
stratasoft s gross margin increased from to 
the decreased gross profit is consistent with a decrease in revenue of  as discussed above  stratasoft s revenue  and consequently its gross profit  suffered from a large portion of its orders for the fourth quarter being booked late in the quarter  resulting in lower recognized revenue and gross profit for both the fourth quarter and the current year 
stratasoft s gross margin is impacted by the mix of sales between systems sales  which include a hardware component  as compared to software only sales  which do not have a hardware cost of goods component 
valerent gross profit decreased  or  from million to million 
valerent s gross margin increased from to 
valerent s cost of service consists primarily of labor cost  which has a more fixed nature 
in periods when service revenue decreases  it becomes more important to manage labor cost in order to prevent erosion of gross margin 
valerent discontinued its relationship with the national service network in the first quarter of because it could not realize high enough margin on the work directed its way by that network 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased  or to million 
as a percentage of total revenue  selling  general and administrative expenses for continuing operations decreased from to 
inx selling  general and administrative expenses increased  or from million to million primarily due to increased sales compensation that is consistent with increased revenue of million 
stratasoft s selling  general and administrative expenses increased  or from million to million primarily due to increased bad debt expense and to stratasoft s lower legal expense due to settlement of the eshare lawsuit resulting in an insurance reimbursement of legal fees incurred in the defense and recorded prior to other factors contributing to stratasoft s increase include increases in rent  promotion and advertising and insurance 
corporate selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by  or from million to  primarily due to administrative staff reductions 
valerent selling  general and administrative expenses decreased  or  from million to million  primarily due to sales and administrative staff reductions  as well as reduced bad debt expense 
other contributing factors in the corporate decrease are decreases in legal expense  bad debt expense  general office expenses and utilities 
operating loss 
operating loss decreased million  or  from million to million  primarily due to the increase in gross profit of million and the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses of  inx s operating loss decreased million  or  from million to a loss of  stratasoft s operating loss increased million  or  from income of  to a loss of  valerent s operating loss decreased  or  from million to million 
the operating loss for the corporate segment decreased  or  from a loss of million to an operating loss of  interest and other income  net 
interest and other income  net decreased  or  from  to  during and continuing through  interest rates decreased steadily due to attempts by the national government to stimulate the economy 
in addition to the decrease in interest rates  while the cash balances at year end are comparable  average cash balances encompassing the entire year were higher 
interest income was also increased by the recognition of other income of  relating to an insurance reimbursement in september net loss 
net loss from continuing operations decreased million  or  from million to  a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets eliminated the income tax benefit 
in march  president bush signed into law the job creation and worker assistance act of under the new law  which provided for the carryback of net operating losses for any taxable year ending during or to each of the five tax years preceding the loss year  we were able to record million in tax benefit 
a valuation allowance has been recorded against remaining income tax benefits generated 
discontinued operations 
in connection with the sale of it staffing  we recognized a loss from discontinued operations of  net of taxes of  on the operations before the measurement date of november  and we recognized a loss on disposal of  and  net of taxes of  and

quarterly results the following table sets forth certain unaudited quarterly financial information for each of our last eight quarters and  in the opinion of management  includes all adjustments consisting of only normal recurring adjustments that we consider necessary for a fair presentation of the information set forth therein 
our quarterly results may vary significantly depending on factors such as the timing of large customer orders  timing of new product introductions  adequacy of product supply  variations in our product costs  variations in our product mix  promotions  seasonal influences and fluctuations in competitive pricing pressures

for the fourth quarter ended december   our revenue  as expected  decreased as compared to the exceptionally strong third quarter  but increased as compared to the fourth quarter of our gross profit has fluctuated between quarters primarily due to changes in our revenue mix between service revenues in inx and valerent and our stratasoft custom project revenue  which have generally generated higher margins  and the lower margin components of our business including product sales in inx and stratasoft 
while inx service gross margin increased significantly and valerent service gross margin increased by a small amount for the fiscal year ended december  as compared to the fiscal year ended december   quarter to quarter gross margin levels have varied primarily based on the level of utilization of billable technical staff and the type of service revenues generated  which can vary from period to period and result in varying levels of gross margin 
while product gross profit also increased for both inx and valerent for the fiscal year ended december   as compared to the fiscal year ended december   the levels of gross margin have also varied  although to a lesser extent  between quarters based on the type of product sold and the mix of large revenue product contracts  which typically have a lower gross margin  as compared with smaller revenue product contracts  which typically have a higher gross margin 
our third quarter gross margin improved in comparison to both the prior quarter and the third quarter of the improved gross margin was the result of higher service revenue from inx  inx vendor incentives and revenue growth in stratasoft  which produces our highest gross margin 
our fourth quarter gross margin declined in comparison to the third quarter but improved in comparison to the fourth quarter of the decline in gross profit in comparison to the third quarter resulted from smaller vendor incentives and lower revenue in stratasoft offset by an increase in the percentage of revenue from higher profit margin services 
in the third quarter of our selling  general and administrative expenses increased as compared to previous quarters due to increases in sales commissions resulting from higher revenue and gross profit and unanticipated increases in bad debt and settlement of litigation 
our selling  general and administrative expenses decreased substantially as compared to the third quarter primarily because of decreased expenses from lower sales commissions related to the decreased level of sales and gross profits during the quarter  lower bad debt expense and lower legal expense as compared to the third quarter critical accounting policies revenue recognition we have a number of different revenue sources  which vary among our three reportable segments 
each reportable segment has more than one revenue source  and revenue is recognized differently for each component or stream of revenue earned by segment 
the material revenue streams earned by us  some of which are earned by more than one segment  and some by only one segment  are products revenue 
all three of our operating segments earn revenue from product shipments 
product shipment revenue occurs when products manufactured by other parties are purchased and resold to a customer and such products are contracted for independently of material services 
we recognize revenue from product shipments when there are binding contracts or purchase orders  the price is fixed or determinable  the product is shipped or delivered to the customer and collectibility is reasonably assured 
services revenue 
all of our operating segments earn revenue from providing stand alone service revenue 
this revenue consists of billings for engineering and technician time  programming services  which are provided on either an hourly basis or a flat fee basis  and the service component of maintenance and repair service ticket transactions 
these services are contracted for separately from any product sale  and are recognized when the service is performed and when collection is reasonably assured 
two of our segments sometimes earn agency fee revenue from various sources  the primary source of which is referring customers to other organizations for which an agency fee is received 
revenue is recognized at the earlier of when payment is received or when notification of amounts being due is received from the entity paying such agency fee and collectibility is reasonably assured 
certain fixed and flat fee contracts that extend over three months or more are accounted for on the percentage of completion method of accounting 
the percentage of revenue recognized in any particular period is determined on the basis of the relationship of the actual hours worked to estimated total hours to complete the contract 
revisions of the estimated hours to complete are reflected in the period in which the facts necessitating the revisions become known 
when a contract indicates a loss  a provision is made for the total anticipated loss 
custom project revenue 
stratasoft earns revenue from projects that are recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting for such revenue 
the majority of stratasoft s revenue consists of systems sales in which it bundles its proprietary software  along with third party hardware products and related software customization services  installation  training services  warranty services and incidental post contract services pcs together under a single contract with the customer 
pcs is insignificant on such contracts for one year or less  and therefore  we have determined that the value of such pcs should not be unbundled from the project revenue as set forth in paragraph of sop accordingly  pcs revenue is recognized together with the project revenue  and the estimated cost to provide the pcs is accrued 
the software customization  together with the hardware customization and integration  represent a significant modification  customization and or production of the product and therefore the entire arrangement is required to be accounted for using the percentage of completion method of accounting pursuant to sop the percentage of revenue recognized in any particular period is determined principally on the basis of the relationship of the cost of work performed on the contract to estimated total costs 
the percentage of completion method relies on estimates of total expected contract revenue and costs 
we follow this method since reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and costs applicable to various stages of a contract can be made 
revisions of estimates are reflected in the period in which the facts necessitating the revisions become known 
when a contract indicates a loss  a provision is made for the total anticipated loss 
we have risk to the extent that this group of customers has not paid or issued contractual letters of credit up to the level of cost and earnings recognized 
on our projects in south asia we typically require a cash payment or letter of credit from the customer prior to shipping the product 
additionally  stratasoft has had revenue derived from africa  the united kingdom  and canada 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts and notes receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
credit and collections policy inherent in our revenue recognition policy is the determination of the collectibility of amounts due from our customers  which requires us to use estimates and exercise judgment 
we routinely monitor our customer s payment history and current credit worthiness to determine that collectibility is reasonably assured and  then in some instances  require letters of credit in support of contracted amounts 
this requires us to make frequent judgments and estimates in order to determine the appropriate period to recognize a sale to a customer and the amount of valuation allowances required for doubtful accounts 
we record provisions for doubtful accounts when it becomes evident that the customer will not be able to make the required payments either at contractual due dates or in the future 
changes in the financial condition of our customers  either adverse or positive  could impact the amount and timing of any additional provision for doubtful accounts that may be required 
liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity our principal sources of liquidity are collections from our accounts and notes receivable  and our credit facility with textron financial corporation the textron facility 
we use the textron facility to finance the majority of our purchases of inventory  and to provide working capital when our cash flow from operations is insufficient 
in  we experienced negative cash flow from operating activities of million 
our working capital was million and million at december  and  respectively 
accounts and notes receivable 
the timing of our collection of accounts and notes receivable and payments of our accounts payable is one of the principal influences on our cash flow from operations 
we typically sell our products and services on short term credit terms 
we try to minimize our credit risk by performing credit checks  obtaining letters of credit in certain instances  and conducting our own collection efforts 
we had accounts receivable  net of allowance for doubtful accounts  of million and million at december  and  respectively 
our stratasoft subsidiary has accepted customer notes receivable as part of its consideration for certain of its custom projects sales 
at december  and december   stratasoft had net notes receivable of  and  respectively 
the current portion of those notes receivable is reflected on our balance sheets as current portion of notes receivable  net  and the long term portion of the notes receivable is reflected on our balance sheets as other assets 
the following table shows the breakdown of the total notes receivable december  dollars in thousands current portion of notes receivable  gross   allowance for doubtful notes current portion of notes receivable  net long term portion of notes receivable  gross allowance for doubtful notes long term portion of notes receivable  net total notes receivable  net alternatively  our stratasoft subsidiary also has other sales that require payment to occur more than days but less than months from the date of the sale 
those outstanding balances are classified as accounts receivable on the accompanying balance sheets 
inventory 
we had inventory of  and million at december  and  respectively 
we try to minimize the amount of inventory on hand to reduce the risk that the inventory will become obsolete or decline in value 
we are able to do this by relying on the ready availability of products from our principal suppliers 
as noted above  we rely principally on our textron facility to finance our inventory purchases 
textron facility 
on january   we entered into the textron facility to provide financing for our inventory purchases 
as of december   we owed million under the textron facility and had an additional million available 
the textron facility is collateralized by substantially all of our assets other than our patent licenses 
in november  textron agreed to increase the textron facility from million to million 
textron also agreed to increase the facility to million subject to the execution of syndication loan documents and an activation of syndication for million with silicon valley bank 
in march  the syndication loan documents were executed  and the credit line was increased to million 
the textron facility is generally subject to borrowing base limitations of of eligible accounts receivable  of identifiable inventory purchased under the textron facility  and of all other inventory 
the borrowing base limitations disallow any account that has more than of the total balance over days old 
we use the textron facility to finance purchases of cisco products from cisco and from certain wholesale distributors 
cisco provides day terms  and other wholesale distributors typically provide day terms 
balances under the textron facility that are within those respective day and day periods the free finance period do not accrue interest and are classified as accounts payable in our balance sheet 
we refer to non interest bearing balances as inventory floor plan borrowings 
to the extent that we can borrow under the textron facility  it gives us the ability to extend the payment terms past the free finance period 
amounts extended past the free finance period accrue interest and are classified as notes payable on our balance sheet 
these extended payment balances under the textron facility accrue interest at the prime rate at december  plus 
because payment cycles of sales to school districts under the e rate program extend beyond days  we expect we will continue to carry extended payment balances under the textron facility during the total outstanding balance under the textron facility at december  was million 
approximately million of that was within the free finance period and therefore is reflected as accounts payable on our balance sheet at december  and approximately million consisted of extended payment balances and therefore is reflected as notes payable on our balance sheet at december  the textron facility contains restrictive covenants that are measured at each quarter end 
these covenants require us to maintain minimum tangible capital funds of million  which is defined to be the sum of cash  trade accounts receivable  inventory and fixed net assets  minus subordinated liabilities minus total liabilities  with total liabilities being defined as accounts payable  accrued expenses and short and long term notes payable  and maintain a maximum debt to tangible capital funds ratio of to additionally  effective at march   we must be able to achieve a fixed charge coverage ratio of no less than to  the fixed charge coverage ratio being defined as a quarterly net income plus interest expense  taxes  and lease and rental expense divided by b the sum of quarterly interest expense and lease and rental expense  and quarterly current maturities of long term debt divided by minus the current tax rate 
at december   we were in compliance with the loan covenants  and we anticipate that we will be able to comply with the loan covenants during if we violate the loan covenants  we would be required to seek waivers from textron and silicon valley bank for those non compliance events 
if textron or silicon valley bank refused to give us waivers  the amount due under the textron facility would be accelerated and we would be required to seek other sources of financing 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes certain of our contractual cash obligations and related payments due as of december  payments due by period less than after contractual obligations total year years years years dollars in thousands lease obligations   textron  interest bearing debt   other debt obligations total contractual cash obligations    we do not have any material contractual purchase obligations 
we purchase inventory to fulfill in hand orders from customers and we try to minimize the amount of inventory on hand to reduce risk that the inventory will become obsolete or decline in value 
we are able to do this by relying on the ready availability of products from our principal suppliers 
we expect to be able to meet our contractual cash payment obligations by their due dates through cash generated from operations  augmented  if needed  by borrowings under the textron facility  and through the proceeds from this offering 
cash flows 
during  our cash decreased by million 
operating activities used million  investing activities used  and financing activities provided million 
operating activities 
operating activities used million in as compared to providing cash of  in and using cash of million in the use of cash in was primarily related to the net loss of million 
adjustments to the net loss for non cash related items for included  for depreciation and amortization and a  gain on disposal of discontinued operations  net of tax  due to collection of discontinued receivables previously reserved against as uncollectable 
adjustments to the net loss for non cash expenses in included bad debt expense of  which is attributable to allowances for uncollectable receivables 
changes in asset and liability accounts used million 
the most significant use related to an increase in accounts receivable of million  which was related primarily to increased revenue 
days sales outstanding stayed consistent at days for both years 
net working capital used for contracts in progress increased  due to an increase in cost and estimated earnings in excess of billings of  which was primarily related to an increase in the stratasoft custom projects in process at year end 
in addition  notes receivable increased  due to more notes receivables being accepted from stratasoft customers  particularly in the first half of these uses of cash were partially offset by an increase in accounts payable of million  which related primarily to increased purchases of cisco products for sales by our inx subsidiary  an increase in accrued expenses of  primarily due to increases in sales commissions and other payroll costs of  due to increased levels of revenue  a decrease in income tax receivable of  related to collection of an income tax refund in  and an increase of  in deferred revenue related to a sale of software to resellers 
investing activities 
investing activities used  in compared to a use of  for and a use of  for our investing activities related to capital expenditures in all three years were primarily related to purchases of computer equipment and software  and to a lesser degree  leasehold improvements 
investing activities related to cash paid for acquisitions increased in due to the acquisition of digital precision by inx 
during the next months  we do not expect to incur significant capital expenditures requiring cash  except possibly for acquisitions  of which we cannot predict the certainty or magnitude 
financing activities 
financing activities provided million in as compared to using  and  respectively  in and in  our stock price increased substantially  resulting in stock option holders exercising stock options  which provided  no options were exercised during the previous two years 
during december  million of debt under the textron facility became interest bearing debt and was classified as notes payable rather than accounts payable 
future trends we expect revenue to continue to increase through for our three subsidiaries 
we expect inx will grow the most  but that inx s growth rate for will be less than its growth rate for we expect cisco centric systems will continue to gain market share  and we expect our revenue growth in will be primarily the result of prior investments in increased sales and marketing programs 
if we are successful at raising additional equity capital early in  we also anticipate making one or more acquisitions in the latter half of  which we expect would add revenue growth 
for we expect our business to be positively impacted by a slight improvement in the somewhat depressed general market conditions that we experienced in  particularly during the first half of  which we expect will result from an upswing in the cyclical buying patterns of customers for technology products as well as the lack of the iraq war  which we believe depressed activity in the first half of we expect to be able to contain the growth in selling  general and administrative expenses somewhat relative to revenue growth  as revenue continues to grow due to of previous investments in sales and marketing  without a further commensurate increase in sales and marketing expenses  and as the increases in revenue are spread over a somewhat fixed corporate administration expense base 
we have experienced no material impact of inflation and changing prices on net sales and income from continuing operations in the last three years 
related party transactions we lease office space from allstar equities  inc  a texas corporation equities  a company wholly owned by james h 
long  our chief executive officer 
on december  equities purchased our corporate office building and executed a direct lease with us with an expiration date of december  in conjunction with equities obtaining new financing on the building  a new lease was executed with us on february  with an expiration date of january  the new lease has a rental rate of  per month
